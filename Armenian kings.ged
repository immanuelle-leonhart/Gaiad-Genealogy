2 CONT <p>[edit] Historical background</p>
2 CONT <p>During the reign of John Smbat III, a feudal lord, David, who owned Taik during his battles against the Muslims, gained a large area which stretched all the way to Manzikert. David was a subject of
2 CONC  Byzantium and when he died his entire territory was occupied by Basil II, who had resumed the policy of, bit by bit, annexing Armenia to his empire. This policy of occupation and expansion was also p
2 CONC ursued by the successors of Basil II. By the death of Smbat III in 1042, Michael V, one of the successors of Basil II, was the emperor cornering Armenia. Michael claimed that the Kingdom of Ani by vir
2 CONC tue of the will of Smbat III, was bequeathed to the Byzantine Empire upon his death. When the Armenian sparapet, Vahram Pahlavouni, prepared the coronation of the successor to Smbat III, king’s neph
2 CONC ew Gagik II who at that time was only fourteen years old, the Byzantine emperor began supporting a rebel, Vest Sarkis, an Armenian pro-Byzantine prince of and minister of the former King who took over
2 CONC  the city of Ani with Byzantine support. After this the Kingdom of Ani resisted three assaults of the Byzantine Empire, forcing them to retreat. Byzantium exerted its forces to the outmost in order to
2 CONC  conquer Armenia and once for all annex it to the empire. To this end, they sent a great army to the southern part of Armenia and at the same time convinced the Albanian king to attack Armenia from th
2 CONC e east. At the fierce battle that was fought by the walls of Ani, general Vahram Pahlavuni heavily defeated the Byzantine army, forcing them to leave 20,000 dead behind. This victory allowed Vahram Pa
2 CONC hlavuni along with Catholicos Petros Guedadarts to crown Gagik II king of Armenia and subsequently take the fortress of Ani, which was in the hands of Vest Sarkis. Sarkis ran away to the fortress of S
2 CONC t. Mary and was eventually captured. After this great victory, the new Armenian king, together with Vahram, turned towards their second enemy, the Seljuk Turks, who were still intent on conquering the
2 CONC  kingdom. In the following two years Gagik reinforced the army and fought against Seljuk hordes. Gregory Pahlavuni nephew of Vahram, defended the fortress of Bjni. The Armenian army hurried to confron
2 CONC t the enemy at the location of the present-day lake Sevan, where the king and his commander split the Armenian army into two units. The first division engaged in a battle with the Seljuk Turks and the
2 CONC n pretended to run away, drawing the Turks after them to the second army, which was lying in ambush. The battle ended with catastrophic defeat for the Seljuk Turks. This defeat of the Turks engendered
2 CONC  as a cry for unification across the Armenian feudal Kingdoms. In the Kingdom of Vaspurakan which formerly under the protection of the Empire, the population had been deserted by Byzantines, the peopl
2 CONC e eagerly anticipated the Armenian king driving the Seljuk Turks out of their homeland. During the leadership of Gagik II, known for his courage as the Lion, the Armenians revolted and the Turks were 
2 CONC forced to retreat to Khoy and Salmas.

2 CONT <p>[edit] Betrayal and exile</p>
2 CONT <p>Vahram began negotiations with the new Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachus. Gagik II offered to be a vassal of the emperor, but the Byzantines did not accept it and prepared a new expeditio
2 CONC n entrusting Duke of Iberia, Michael Iasites, but he failed in the face of the Armenian resistance. Emperor Constantine wished to continue the policy of his predecessors and therefore sent an army to 
2 CONC conquer Armenia, whilst inciting the Arab emir of Dvin, Aboul Asvar, to attack Armenia from the east. King Gagik II, however, managed to get placate Aboul Asvar, by sending him gifts, allowing him to 
2 CONC concentrate his forces against the Byzantines, eventually forcing them to flee. Thus, King Gagik II proved he was worthy of the throne and the title of fighting king, which had passed on to him from t
2 CONC he very first kings in the Bagratuni dynasty. Byzantines had realised that that if Armenia could not be conquered by force, it could be taken by treachery. Gagik II made the grave mistake of forgiving
2 CONC  Vest Sarkis for his high treason against the crown. This traitor was still a subject of Byzantium, constantly fostering the naive hope of being appointed as king of Armenia if Byzantium was to conque
2 CONC r Armenia. With the assistance of Vest Sarkis, the Byzantine emperor invited Gagik II to Constantinople to sign a permanent peace-treaty. Gagik II was lured into the trap and went to Constantinople. T
2 CONC here the emperor demanded that the Armenian king abdicate and hand over the throne to him, and since Gagik II refused to do so he was thrown into jail. Byzantines promptly sent an army to Armenia, whi
2 CONC ch was now without its leader. In lieu of its king, Armenia considered offering the throne of the country to David Anholin of Lori or to the emir of Dwin, Abul Uswar, married to the sister of David An
2 CONC holin, and even to Bagrat IV of Georgia. Bagratuni King Gagik Abas of Kars was not considered. The patriarch Petros did not approve of any of the three candidates and finally conceded to the Byzantine
2 CONC s the delivery of the city and other fortresses. Finally, with the help of the treachery of Catholicos Petros, Byzantines were able to occupy Ani in 1045. The country was immediately inaugurated as a 
2 CONC province in the empire. Not satisfied with the extinction of the political life of the Armenians, the Byzantine clergy insisted upon their conversion to the Greek Orthodox faith. Meanwhile Armenia bec
2 CONC ame economically the slave of the functionaries sent from the capital, who crushed the people under the burden of heavy taxes. The Armenian nobility, a favorite subject of persecution, suffered the he
2 CONC aviest losses through systematic purges by the civil authorities. The only parts of Armenia which continued their independent existence were Kars, which managed to maintain its independence for a coup
2 CONC le decades longer, and Lori which thanks to its geographical situation was much more secure and continued its independence for another century. By destroying the government of Bagratuni Armenian Kingd
2 CONC om in Ani, Byzantines had also removed the only power which could withstand a full scale Seljuk invasion. By itself, Byzantium could not summon the same level of defence with which Armenia had managed
2 CONC  to hold off the Seljuks. Alfred Rambaud express the following on this matter: “The Byzantine occupation of Armenia resulted in catastrophic consequences for both sides, since the empire lost its na
2 CONC tural link through which it was connected to the east. Until that point the Armenians had managed to withstand all assaults, but when Armenia lost its royal dynasty, everything else was lost as well.�

2 CONC ichael Iasites, duke of Iberia was entrusted with the government of Ani. Sarkis went in the service of Bagrat IV of Georgia. The Bishop of Caesarea, named Marcus, lost no occasion to express his scorn
2 CONC  towards Gagik whom he considered a heretic. After several insults by Marcus directed against him, Gagik eventually murdered the Bishop which made Gagik even more unpopular among the locals. As the st
2 CONC ory goes, it is said the Bishop had a dog named Armenen, so as to scorn the Armenians. One day, Gagik took the dog, put it in a bag, and beat it, he then put the bishop in the same bag with the now ma
2 CONC d dog. The bishop was killed by his own dog. Later Gagik was kidnapped by the Byzantine governors (three brothers) of Kyzistra who hanged him, in 1080. During the reign of Thoros I of the Armenian Kin
2 CONC gdom of Cilicia the death of king Gagik II was avenged. The Armenian forces took the fortress of Kyzistra and killed the three Byzantines who had hung the last King of Ani.

2 CONC 0].  The sources are contradictory regarding the parentage of Katramide.  According to Vardan, she was the daughter of Vasak [VI] prince of Siunik[111].  The Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa records tha
2 CONC t the mother of Yovhanes was “la reine Gadramidtkh…fille du roi de Géorgie, Kourke”[112].  It is assumed that this is intended to mean that she was Katramide, daughter of Gurgen [I] Prince of K

2 CONC on, dated to after [1017/20].  It is unclear from the context of the passage whether “le chef Géorgien” in question refers to Yovhanes´s maternal grandfather, although the reference by Matthew t
2 CONC o this “chef Géorgien” being “Aph´khaz de naissance” [113] suggests that this might be the case.  If the passage indicates the same person, this alleged parentage is cast in doubt, as the de
2 CONC ath of Prince Gurgen is dated to 1008 in the Georgian Chronicle (18th Century).  Alternatively, “le chef Géorgien” may refer to Katramide´s supposed nephew King Giorgi [I], who is recorded as ru
2 CONC ling Abkhazia at the time of the death of Yovhanes´s father.  This explanation has the advantage of elucidating why the passage in Matthew´s Chronicle avoids referring to “le chef” explicitly as
2 CONC  Yovhanes´s grandfather.  The contradictions in the early passages of the Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa, combined with the extreme unreliability of the various editions of the Georgian Chronicle as 
2 CONC discussed in detail in the document GEORGIA, suggest that it is unwise to conclude anything more precise about the parentage of Katramide other than the likelihood of her father being of Georgian orig

2 CONT <p>King Gagik I & his wife had three children:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>*1.         YOVHANES-SMBAT (-1041).  The History of Aristakes Lastivertci names "Smbat who was called Yohannes and his brother Ashot" as the sons of "Gagik son of Ashot", recording that Giorgi King
2 CONC  of Abkhazia arbitrated their dispute over their inheritance and awarded "the stronghold of Ani and the districts surrounding it" to Yohannes-Smbat and "the lower part of the land facing Persia and Ge
2 CONC orgia" to Ashot[114].  He succeeded his father in [1017/20] as SMBAT III King of Armenia, ruling jointly with his brother, based at Ani.  Kirakos Ganjaketsi's History of Armenia records that "his son 
2 CONC Yohannes" succeeded "Gagik Shahnshah" and ruled for 20 years[115].  He was embroiled in territorial quarrels with his brother and with the King of Kars, and proposed in 1022 to bequeath his kingdom to
2 CONC  Emperor Basileios II.  The Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa records that disputes between Yovhanes and his brother, commenting that the former was “un homme savant et ingénieux, mais d´une grande o
2 CONC bésité”[116].  The History of Aristakes Lastivertci records that King Smbat proposed to bequeath his kingdom to Emperor Basileios II as his son had predeceased him[117].  He was granted the imperi
2 CONC al title archon.  The Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa records the death “en l´année 490 [11 Mar 1041/10 Mar 1042]” of “le roi d´Arménie Jean, frère d´Aschod et fils de Kakig, de la famille 
2 CONC des Bagratides” and his burial at Ani[118].  The History of Aristakes Lastivertci records the death in the same year of "the two brothers Asot and Yovhannes"[119].  On his death in 1041, Byzantium c

2 CONT <p>*2.         ASHOT (-1041, bur Ani).  The History of Aristakes Lastivertci names "Smbat who was called Yohannes and his brother Ashot" as the sons of "Gagik son of Ashot", recording that Giorgi King

2 CONC  the Kurdish Shaddadid Emirs from Ganja.  The Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa records that disputes between Yovhanes and his brother, commenting that the latter had “l´esprit militaire et un courage
2 CONC  invincible”, adding in a later passage that “Aschod…ne parvint jamais de sa vie à entrer dans la ville d´Ani”[127].  The Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa records the death “en l´année 489

2 CONC  Kakig et frère de Jean” left “un fils…Kakag…âgé de quinze ans”[130].  The History of Aristakes Lastivertci records the accession of "Gagik son of Ashot" after the death of his father and
2 CONC  paternal uncle[131].  He succeeded his father in 1041 as GAGIK II King of Armenia.  Kirakos Ganjaketsi's History of Armenia records that "Gagik son of Ashot…[his] brother's son" succeeded after the
2 CONC  death of "Yovhannes…also called Smbat" and ruled for two years, but that he "had no interest in military affairs…but…was trained from childhood in literature" and that "the Byzantines…called 
2 CONC him to them" and "put the journeyer into exile on an island and appointed overseers to occupy his place for one year"[132].  He was brought to Ani to be crowned but was unable to evict the Byzantine f
2 CONC orces of the regent Sargis Haykazn.  The Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa paints a slightly different picture when it records that “un jeune homme de dix-neuf ans…Kakig…fils du roi Aschod…” (i
2 CONC mplying a delay of four years after the death of his father) was crowned king of Armenia by “Grégoire”, and that King Gagik captured “Sarkis”[133].  In 1043, Gagik was invited to Constantinop

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gagik I (reigned 989 - 1020) was a Bagratid King of Armenia. His brother Smbat II the Conqueror (reigned 977-989) preceded him.

2 CONT <p>Gagik followed the footsteps of his predecessors in building churches and religious buildings in his capital Ani. After his death, his elder son, Smbat III, was crowned king while his younger son, 
2 CONC Ashot, rebelled against Smbat and proclaimed his independence in the Kingdom of Lori-Joraget.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>One of Gagik's principal projects was the church of St. Gregory in Ani (1001-10), loosely modeled on Zvartnots. During Nikolai Marr's excavation of its ruins in 1906, a large statue of King Gagik h

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Kingdom of Artsakh (Armenian: Արցախի թագավորություն) was a medieval dependent Armenian kingdom on the territory of Syunik, Artsakh (present-day Nagorno-Karabakh), Gardman an
2 CONC d Gegharkunik.[1] Contemporary sources referred to it as the Khachen. The royal[citation needed] house of Khachen was a cadet branch of the ancient Syunid dynasty and was named Khachen, after its main
2 CONC  stronghold. The kingdom emerged when Hovhannes-Senekerim acquired the royal title in 1000.[citation needed]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The kingdom was under the protectorate of the Bagratuni kings of Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artsakh maintained its sovereign rulers, though in the early 13th century they accepted Georgian, then Mongol suzerainty.[2] They lost the royal title after the assassination of Hasan-Jalal (1214��
2 CONC �1261) by the Ilkhanid ruler Arghun, but continued to rule Syunik as a principality, which from the 16th century comprised five Armenian melikdoms and lasted until the early 19th century.[1] The desce

2 CONT <p>Sahak Sevada (Armenian: Սահակ Սեւադայ, romanized: Sahak Sewaday[a]) was ruler of Gardman between 895–940 and father-in-law of King Ashot II of Armenia. He was the son of Grigol Hamam 
2 CONC and brother of Atrnerseh, ruler of Hereti.[1] His possessions covered Parisos, a district of Artsakh, as well as part of Utik-Gardman and Dzoroget.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Book III of the medieval Armenian text The History of the Country of Albania, Sahak Sevada is described as a "brave and capable man" who was a "lover of letters and appointed writers to his hous
2 CONC ehold." The author adds that "Smbat, king of Armenia, fought against him [Sahak Sevada] with zeal and skill, but could not bring him to submission."[2] Sahak's contemporary, Catholicos Hovhannes Drask
2 CONC hanakerttsi, describes him as a man of "great wisdom."[3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The author of The History of the Country of Albania writes that Sahak Sevada had two sons, Grigor and Davit, and several grandsons and great-grandsons through Grigor, one of whom, John Senekerim, l

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sahak Sevada married one of his daughters to Ashot II, ruler of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. His other daughter Shahandukht was married to Smbat, ishkhan (later king) of Syunik. Sahak aided Kin
2 CONC g Ashot II in an unsuccessful assault against the king's cousin and pretender to the throne, also named Ashot, and in crushing a revolt by Prince Movses of Utik.[3] However, as a result of political c

2 CONT <p>Ashot I Kuropalates</p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p>Jump to: navigation, search</p>
2 CONT <p>Ashot I Kuropalates (end of the 8th cent. - 830), presiding prince of Iberia for the Caliph and the Byzantine Emperor. In traditional Georgian history writing, based on the works of Prince Vakhusht
2 CONC i Bagrationi and Marie-Félicité Brosset, Ashot I Kuropalates, also known as Ashot the Great, is regarded as the founder of the Georgian Bagrationi dynasty. His reign is assumed to have begun in 786 
2 CONC or even in 780; Ashot would thus have been the direct successor of St Archil, the last member of the old royal house of the Iberian Chosroids. However, the real date of Ashot's accession must have bee
2 CONC n later, since the last acquisitions of lands by his father Adarnase which are mentioned in the sources could only have taken place after the death of Archil.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The claim put forward in traditional Georgian genealogy, that Ashot I was a descendent of the 6th-century prince Guaram I (c.570-c.595), the alleged first Bagratid ruler of Iberia, cannot be sustai
2 CONC ned since Ashot’s father Adarnase was the grandson of Ashot III Bagratuni (732-748), presiding prince of Armenia for the Caliph.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ashot I initially presided as an erismtavari in the area around Tbilisi and ruled over a territory that comprised most of the lands from Kvemo Kartli (“Lower Kartli”) in the south to Shida Kart
2 CONC li (“Inner Kartli”) in the north. Waging an incessant war against the Arabs, he at first succeeded in driving them from his dominions, but the Arabs soon took revenge, forcing him to flee from cen
2 CONC tral Kartli to his south-western possessions in Tao-Klarjeti. Recognised as the presiding prince of Iberia and bestowed with the highest Byzantine court title of a kuropalates, he established himself 
2 CONC in the deserted province of Klarjeti, where he restored the castle of Artanuji (now Ardanuç, northeast Turkey) said to have been built by the Iberian king Vakhtang I Gorgasal in the 5th century. To r
2 CONC evive the country devastated by the Arabs and cholera epidemics, he patronized the local monastic community established by Grigol Khandzteli, and encouraged the settlement of the Georgians in the regi
2 CONC on. As a result, the political and religious centres of Iberia/Georgia were effectively transferred from central Kartli to the south-western provinces of Tao-Klarjeti.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From his base in Klarjeti, Ashot fought hard to recover more Georgian lands from the Arab occupation and, though not always successful, succeeded in taking much of the adjoining lands from Tao in t
2 CONC he southwest to Shida Kartli in the northeast. Towards the late 810s, he allied with Theodosius II of Abkhazia (810/811-836/837) in order to stop the advancing Kakhetian prince/chorepiscopus Grigol wh
2 CONC o had occupied part of Ashot’s territories in Shida Kartli. Even though Grigol was aided by both the Arab emir of Tbilisi, and the Caucasian mountain tribes of the Mtiulians and the Tsanars, he was 
2 CONC defeated by Ashot in the battle on the Ksani river, and the outcome of the battle was that Ashot could restore his authority in the region.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 827/828, Khalid b. Yazid, the Arab viceroy of Arminiya, began a major onslaught against Ashot’s principality. Ashot I must have been still alive at that time, and the information provided by t
2 CONC he Georgian chronicler Sumbat, according to which Ashot I should have been murdered in 826, is doubtful. It is more likely that the event took place four years later, in 830. Ashot was buried in the c
2 CONC hurch of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul which he had built in Artanuji. He is canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church, which celebrates his memory on the day of his martyrdom, January 29.

2 CONT <p>Ashot I Bagratuni was an Armenian prince, with Ashot II, oversaw Armenia's second golden age (862-977). He was born to Smbat the Confessor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His family, the Bagratunis, was one of the most powerful in the kingdom along with the Artsruni. Both families were struggling for power through warfare against Arab invaders. He was recognized by 
2 CONC the Abbasid Caliph as Prince of Princes of Armenia in 862. His later crowning as King of Armenia was consented to by Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'tamid in 885, a move to prevent intrusion into the Armenian te
2 CONC rritory by Basil I Byzantine emperor, an Armenian. He was succeeded by his son, Smbat I. He reigned for five years until 890 and was married to Katranide.

2 CONT <p>THE BAGRATID KINGDOM - One of the leading princely dynasties in Armenia was that of the Bagratids (Bagratuni). After the 8th century, when they has triumphed over the rival house of Mamikonian, the
2 CONC  Bragatids practically monopolized the office of presiding prince of Armenia. With the temporary weakening of both the Byzantine and Islamic empires in the following century, the Bagratids consolidate
2 CONC d their power and restored the kingdom of Armenia. In 862 Ashot V was recognized by the caliph as "prince of princes" of Armenia; and in 886 he re-established the kingship and was recognized by both B

2 CONT <p>http://www.tacentral.com/aragatsotn/ARAGATSOTN_Region.pdf</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Worn down by continued Armenian rebellions, in 861, the Arabs appointed Ashot Bagratuni ("the Carnivorous") Prince over Armenia, and in 885 King of Armenia, beginning a long period of eminence for 
2 CONC his family (The Bagratuni or Bagratid dynasty).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aragatsotn became a part of the Bagratuni landholdings, forfeited by the Mamikonians after their defeat during the 774-775 revolt. The Arabs gave the lands to the Bagratunis, who had not joined the
2 CONC  rebellion, creating a vast northern kingdom relatively free from Arab and Byzantine interference.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Bagratuni dynasty lasted until the end of the 11th century, when Seljuk and Byzantine attacks captured and then destroyed the Bagratuni capital at Ani, as well as Vagharshapat and Dvin.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ashot I Bagratuni (Աշոտ Մեծ) was an Armenian prince, with Ashot II, oversaw Armenia's second golden age (862–977). He was born to Smbat the Confessor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His family, the Bagratunis, was one of the most powerful in the kingdom along with the Artsruni. Both families were struggling for power through warfare against Arab invaders.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was recognized by the Abbasid Caliph as Prince of Princes of Armenia in 862. His later crowning as King of Armenia was consented to by Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'tamid in 885, a move to prevent intrus
2 CONC ion into the Armenian territory by Basil I Byzantine emperor, an Armenian.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was succeeded by his son, Smbat I. He reigned for five years until 890 and was married to Katranide.

2 CONT <p>Ben M. Angel notes: The original dates of birth and death were 750-826. Obviously, these weren't correct, given that he became Prince of Armenia in 861, and King of Armenia in 885, under an Arabian
2 CONC  overlord, and given that he was the first Bagratuni to take this title.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His epithet "the Carnivore" is apparently synonymous with "the Brave" in Armenian. (Not very likely to be a cannibal.)

2 CONT <p>The Arsacid dynasty, called the Arshakuni (Armenian: Արշակունիներ, romanized: Aršakuni) in Armenian, ruled the Kingdom of Armenia from 12 to 428.[1] The dynasty was a branch of the Ars
2 CONC acid dynasty of Parthia. Arsacid kings reigned intermittently throughout the chaotic years following the fall of the Artaxiad dynasty until 62, when Tiridates I, brother of Parthian King Vologases I, 
2 CONC secured Arsacid rule in Armenia as a client king of Rome. However, he did not succeed in establishing his line on the throne, and various princes of different Arsacid lineages ruled until the accessio
2 CONC n of Vologases II, who succeeded in establishing his own line on the Armenian throne, which ruled the kingdom until its abolishment by the Sasanian Empire in 428.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Two of the most notable events under Arsacid rule in Armenian history were the conversion of Armenia to Christianity by Gregory the Illuminator and Tiridates III in 301/314 and the creation of the 
2 CONC Armenian alphabet by Mesrop Mashtots in c. 405. In contrast to the more Hellenic-influenced Artaxiads, the reign of the Arsacids of Armenia was marked by greater Iranian influence in the country.[1]

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Constantin II, the tsar of Kakhetia, gave him the title of Sparapet which at the time meant commander of cavalry in Sasanian army, but in Albania, it was given to the head commander of the entire a
2 CONC rmy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Javanshir (Armenian: Ջիվանշիր, Middle Persian: Jūvānšīr, New Persian: جوان شیر, meaning young lion), was the prince of Caucasian Albania from 637 to 680, hailing from the region 
2 CONC of Gardman. His life and deeds were the subject of legends that were recorded in Armenian medieval texts. He was from the Parthian Mihranid family, an offshoot of the House of Mihran, one of the seven
2 CONC  Parthian clans of the Sasanian Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Javanshir was the second son of Varaz Grigor, a prince of Gardman who belonged to the Mihranid family, and an Iberian princess named Goridouxt. In 637 Varaz Grigor was baptised and declared Christi
2 CONC anity as the official religion of Caucasian Albania, thus making his son, Javanshir, convert too. However, Varaz was deposed by the Sasanian king who didn't acknowledge his conversion to Christianity.
2 CONC  Thus Javanshir became the king of Caucasian Albania.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Javanshir was known for his bravery and intelligence; he fought against the Arabs during the Muslim conquest of Persia on the side of the Sasanian Empire, and was rewarded by the Sasanian king Yazd
2 CONC egerd III himself two golden spears, two golden shields and a flag,[4] probably the Derafsh Kaviani. In 636, he led an Albanian army, which alongside the Armenian prince Musel III Mamikonian and Grigo
2 CONC r of Syunik, took part in the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah between the Persian and Arab armies. However, the Sasanians were defeated, which made Javanshir lose hope. He then made a mutiny against his over
2 CONC lords and retreated to Caucasian Albania. Where he wrote a letter to Constans II and became ally with the Byzantine Empire. He was then awarded with the title of patrikios, and recognized as king of t
2 CONC he East. He also married to a noble from a princely family of Syunik.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After his alliance with the Byzantines, he joined his forces with the Iberian king Adarnase I in an attack on Sasanian garrisons in Albania. He later expanded his dominion from Derbent to Aras rive
2 CONC r.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Facing the threat of the Arab invasion on the south and the Khazar offensive on the north, Javanshir had to recognize the Caliph’s suzerainty, a move, which would prove to be a turning point in t
2 CONC he country's history.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Javanshir was assassinated, in 680, by the rival nobles, whose power he had tried to restrict. He was succeeded by Varaz Trdat.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The only historical source about the life and deeds of Javanshir comes from the Armenian text by Movses Kaghankatvatsi, known as History of the Land of Aghvank.[6] Movses Kaghankatvatsi's text incl
2 CONC udes a poem dedicated to Javanshir Elegy on the Death of the Great Prince Jevansher by Davtak Kertogh (Davtak the Poet), a 7th-century Armenian poet and the first secular writer in Armenian literature
2 CONC . The only surviving poem by Kertogh is written in Armenian, in alphabetical acrostic verse.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Legendary origin</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The origin of the Mamikonians is shrouded in the mists of antiquity. Moses of Chorene in his Primary History of Armenia (5th or 6th century) claims that three centuries earlier two Chinese noblemen
2 CONC , Mamik and Konak, rose against their half-brother, Chenbakur, the Emperor of Chenk, or China. They were defeated and fled to the king of Parthia who, braving the Emperor's demands to extradite the cu
2 CONC lprits, sent them to live in Armenia, where Mamik became the progenitor of the Mamikonians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Another 5th-century Armenian historian, Pawstos Buzand, seconded the story. In his History of Armenia, he twice mentions that the Mamikonians descended from the Han dynasty of China and as such wer
2 CONC e not inferior to the Arshakid rulers of Armenia. This genealogical legend may have been part of the Mamikonians' political agenda, as it served to add prestige to their name. Although it echoes the B
2 CONC agratids' claim of Davidic descent and the Artsruni's claim of the royal Assyrian ancestry, some Armenian historians tended to interprete it as something more than a piece of genealogical mythology.[1
2 CONC ] A theory from the 1920s postulated that the Chenk mentioned in the Armenian sources were not the Chinese but a different ethnic group from Transoxania, such as the Tocharians.[1] Edward Gibbon in hi
2 CONC s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire also believed that the founder of Mamikonian clan was not Chinese but merely from the territory of the Chinese Empire and ascribes a Scythian 
2 CONC origin to Mamgon stating that at the time the borders of the Chinese Empire reached as far West as Sogdiana.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Today, some historians are of the opinion that the Mamikonians were probably descended from chieftans of the Tzans (Chanik - ?????/????? - in medieval Armenian, Tzannoi in medieval Greek). The Tzan
2 CONC s[3] were a tribe that once inhabited a mountainous region to the south of Trebizond. They postulate that the tradition of the Chinese origin arose out of the similarity of the name Chanik to the Arme
2 CONC nian word for China, Chen-k.[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Early history</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The first known Mamikonid lord, or nakhararq, about whom anything certain is known was a certain Vatche Mamikonian (fl. 330-339). The family reappears in chronicles in 355, when the bulk of their l
2 CONC ands lay in Tayk. At that point the family chief was Vasak Mamikonian, a commander-in-chief (sparapet) of Armenia. Later, the office of sparapet would become hereditary possession of the Mamikonians. 
2 CONC Vasak was in charge of the Armenian defense against Persia but was eventually defeated through the treachery of Marujan Ardzruni (c. 367-368).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Following that defeat, Vasak's brother Vahan Mamikonian and multiple other feudal lords defected to the Persian side. The Emperor Valens, however, interfered in Armenian affairs and had the office 
2 CONC of sparapet bestowed on Vasak's son Mushegh Mamikonian in 370. Four years later Varazdat, a new king, confirmed Musel in office. The latter was subsequently assassinated on behest of Sembat Saharuni w
2 CONC ho replaced him as sparapet of Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On this event, the family leadership passed to Mushegh's brother, Enmanuel Mamikonian, who had been formerly kept as a hostage in Persia. The Mamikonids at once broke into insurrection and routed V
2 CONC arazdat and Saharuni at Karin. Enmanuel, together with his sons Hemaiak and Artches, took the king prisoner and put him in a fortress, whence Varazdat escaped abroad. Zarmandukht, the widow of Varazda
2 CONC t's predecessor, was then proclaimed queen. Enmanuel came to an agreement with the powerful Sassanids, pledging his loyalty in recompense for their respect of the Armenian autonomy and laws.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Upon the queen's demise in 384, Enmanuel Mamikonian was proclaimed Regent of Armenia pending the minority of her son Arsaces III and had the infant king married to his daughter Vardandukh. It was E
2 CONC nmanuel's death in 385 that precipitated the country's conquest by the Persians in 386-387.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Vartan Mamikonian</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hamazasp Mamikonian was recorded as the family leader in 393. His wife is known to have been Sahakanoush, daughter of Saint Sahak the Great and descendant of the Arsacid kings. They had a son, Sain
2 CONC t Vartan Mamikonian, who is revered as one of the greatest military and spiritual leaders of ancient Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Vartan became Sparapet in 432, the Persians summoned him to Ctesiphon, forcing him to convert to Zoroastrianism. Upon his return to home in 450, Vartan repudiated the Persian religion and ins
2 CONC tigated a great Armenian rebellion against their Sassanian overlords. Although he died in the doomed Battle of Vartanantz (451), the continued insurrection led by Vahan Mamikonian, the son of Vartan's
2 CONC  brother, resulted in the restoration of Armenian autonomy with the Nvarsak Treaty (484), thus guaranteeing the survival of Armenian statehood in later centuries. Saint Vartan is commemorated by an eq
2 CONC uestrian statue in Yerevan.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the country's subjugation by the Persians, Mamikonians sided with the Roman Empire, with many family members entering Byzantine service. Not only did they rise to the highest offices of Const
2 CONC antinople, but even some of the emperors - conceivably Leo the Armenian and Basil I - could have been their descendants. Theodora the Byzantine regent and her brothers Bardas and Petronas the Patricia
2 CONC n were also of Mamikonian heritage. Unsurprisingly, Mamikonians form a crucial link in the postulated descent of modern European nobility from antiquity.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Early Middle Ages</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The history of Mamikonians in the Early Middle Ages is quite obscure. In the period between 655 and 750 they are not documented at all. What follows below is their reconstructed genealogy between t
2 CONC he 5th and 7th centuries.

2 CONT <p>[edit] Last Mamikonians</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By 750, Mamikonians lost Taron, Khelat, and Mouch to the Bagratuni family. In the 770s the family was led by Artavizd Mamikonian, then by Musel IV (+772) and by Samuel II. The latter married his da
2 CONC ughter to Smbat VII Bagratuni, Constable of Armenia. His grandson Smbat Msaker ("the Carnivore") became forefather of Bagratid rulers of Armenia and Taron.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mamikonians are known to have led a national rebellion against the Arab Caliphate in 774-775. After the rebels were rooted out, Mamikonians' supremacy in Armenia came to an end. Even in their homel
2 CONC and of Tayk, they were succeeded by the Bagratids. One Kurdik Mamikonian was recorded as ruling Sasun ca. 800. Half a century later, Grigor Mamikonian lost Bagrevand to the Muslims, reconquered it in 
2 CONC the early 860s and then lost it to the Bagratids for good. After that, Mamikonians pass out of history.

2 CONT <p>For two hundred years after the fall of the Arshakuni dynasty of Armeniaº in 428, the country was governed by Marzbans (Governors-general of the boundaries), nominated by the Persian King. Of the 
2 CONC thirty-five Marzbans who ruled in succession, six were Armenians. Western or Byzantine Armenia was at that time ruled by Curopalatesº (Governors), almost all Armenians by race, but with limited prero
2 CONC gatives.
2 CONT <p>The Marzban was invested with supreme power, even to the imposing of death sentences; but he could not interfere with the age-long privileges of the Armenian nakharars. The country as a whole, enjo
2 CONC yed a considerable autonomy. The office of Hazarapet, corresponding to that of a Minister of the Interior and Public Works, was entrusted to an Armenian, as was also the post of military Commander-in-
2 CONC chief. Each nakharar had his own army, according to the extent of his domain. The "National cavalry" or "Royal force" was under the Commander-in-chief. The tax collectors were all Armenians. The court
2 CONC s of justice and the schools were directed by the Armenian clergy.
2 CONT <p>Three times during the Marzbanic period, Persian kings launched persecutions against Christianity in Armenia. The Persians had tolerated the invention of the Armenian alphabet and the founding of s
2 CONC chools, thinking those would promote the spiritual severance of Armenia from the Byzantine Greeks; but on the contrary, the new cultural movement among the Armenians actually proved to be conducive to
2 CONC  a closer relation with the Greeks.

2 CONT <p>Det historiska Armenien</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det ursprungliga Armenien upptog, ett flertal sekel f Kr, ett stort område öster om Mindre
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Asien och söder om Kaukasus. Svarta havet och Kaspiska havet ligger i nordväst, respektive
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nordost. Söderut låg parternas och persernas mäktiga riken. Den kanske mest kända symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>för Armenien är berget Ararat, där Noaks ark ska ha strandat efter sin långa resa. (Idag ligger
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>visserligen berget strax innanför den turkiska gränsen, men det är fullt synligt från många
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>delar av landet.)</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Namnet Ararat är nära besläktat med Urartu, assyriernas namn på det kungarike som en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gång låg på samma plats som det historiska Armenien. Detta rike nådde sin höjdpunkt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>omkring 800-talet till 500-talet f Kr och var då en stark konkurrent till det mäktiga Assyrien,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>om makten i området. En annan historiskt och symboliskt viktig plats är Araxesdalen, som är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mycket bördig och som av vissa påstås vara det ursprungliga Edens lustgård.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>När Urartu-riket gick under ca 590 f Kr kom olika stammar invandrande till området.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tillsammans kallade de sig för Hayastan, vilket fortfarande är det armeniska språkets
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>benämning på Armenien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tre hjältar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska historien skulle kunna skrivas mycket lång och händelserik, men de första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>femhundra åren e Kr skulle kunna sammanfattas runt tre historiska hjältar, vilka alla har sin
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>plats i den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>189 f Kr utgjorde delar av Armenien en provins inom det seleukidiska riket, men detta år
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inleddes även något som skulle bli den armeniska storhetstiden. Arthases (Artaxias) utropade
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nämligen en del av området till ett självständigt kungadöme, vilket under den närmaste
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>följande tiden fick flera efterföljare. Med tiden kom de att närma sig varandra, för att sedan,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under kung Tigran den store (95 – 56 f Kr) bli enade till en nation. Det var också under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>honom som det historiska Armenien nådde sin geografiskt sett största utbredning, omfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bland annat delar av Mesopotamien, Syrien, Cilicien och ända ner mot Palestina. Visserligen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hann riket även minska en del under kung Tigrans styre, då romarna erövrade delar av landet,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>men detta talas det inte mycket om, utan det är enandet av landet som är det viktiga.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under åren 287 – 294 och 297 – 330 e Kr styrdes Armenien av kung Tirdat III. Det var
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under dennes tid som St Grigor (Gregorius), upplysaren, enligt traditionen kom till landet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ska ha omvänt kungen (och därmed hela folket) till kristendomen. Detta ska ha skett år 301
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och med stöd av detta hävdar armenierna att de utgör den äldsta kristna staten i världen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenierna det äldsta kristna folket.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Från år 430 och under ett par århundraden framöver var Armenien delat mellan Bysans i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>väst och perserna i öst. De senare inledde förföljelser mot folket för att få dem att övergå till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den persiska zoroastrismen. En nationell, armenisk armé samlades dock under general Vardan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mamikonians ledning för att kämpa mot perserna. År 451 stod ett avgörande slag vid Avrayr,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>där visserligen armenierna förlorade mot den överlägsna persiska krigsmaskinen och där
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>general Vardan dog, men armenierna garanterades rätten att förbli kristna under persisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>överhöghet. Vardan är en förebild för folkets kamp mot olika förtryckare och kampen för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>rätten att vara kristna.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ett lidande folk</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Förutom de dryga sex seklerna kring Kristi födelse har armenierna nästan alltid varit styrda av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(och ofta uppdelade mellan) andra riken. Den längsta perioden av främmande styre och även
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den som kanske har satt mest spår i dagens armeniska identitet var den turkiska/ottomanska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tiden. Redan under 1000-talets andra hälft trängde turkarna in i området och tog makten för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett par hundra år. Efter ett antal andra härskare från olika håll kom sedan Armenien åter under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>turkiskt styre på 1500-talet, något som skulle sätta ett outplånligt spår i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>historien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Genom historien har återkommande upprorsförsök mot olika ockupationsmakter så gott
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som alltid brutalt slagits ned. Detta har givit den armeniska identiteten en ständig närvaro av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det historiska lidande som folket gått igenom under århundradenas lopp. Det finns dock ett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>särskilt tillfälle som varit upphov till värre lidande än någonsin tidigare. Under 1880-talet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hade en nationell armenisk rörelse uppstått, något som inte sågs med blida ögon av de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>styrande turkarna. Svåra förföljelser kom till följd av detta, vilka kulminerade i deportation
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och systematisk utrotning av omkring 1,5 miljoner människor under och strax efter första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>världskriget. Denna ofattbara tragedi lever kvar i näst intill varje armenier idag, och går ofta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under namnet ”massakern”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Att detta ”historiens första folkmord” idag kan vara så okänt är skrämmande. Relativt sett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>var massmorden på armenier större än nazisternas utrotningsförsök av judar. De 1,5 miljoner
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som avrättades utgjorde en större del av folket än de ca 6 miljoner judar som fick sätta livet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>till under andra världskriget.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkan ger identitet</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Då armenierna saknat kungar och andra oberoende styren under större delen av historien har
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ledarskapet för nationen, och därmed också centralpunkten för identifikationen, tagits över av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska apostoliska kyrkan. De mest begåvade intellektuella har ofta blivit präster och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under lång tid var den armeniska utbildningen underställd kyrkan. Tillsammans med den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gemensamma historien av lidande och det egna språket utgör den kristna tron grundpelarna i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska kyrkan präglas av två starka särdrag. Det första är kyrkans strukturella
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>demokratiska uppbyggnad. Liksom flera andra kyrkor är den armeniska kyrkan idag uppdelad
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>i (fyra) patriarkat, i vilka patriarkerna (katolikoserna) har en stark ställning som talesmän för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska befolkningen i respektive område. Det råder dock inga motsättningar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>patriarkerna emellan, utan snarare tvärtom. I ett tal uttryckte en av dem sig på följande sätt:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”Vi är en kyrka. Vi har varit en kyrka genom århundraden. Vi ska fortsätta att vara en kyrka i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kommande århundrade.” Den, med historiska mått mätt, demokratiska och allomfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan har säkerligen många gånger motverkat splittring hos folket. Det andra karaktärsdraget
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är den på vissa punkter näst intill unika kristna läran. Framför allt är det den monofysitiska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ståndpunkten som utmärker sig, vilken utvecklas senare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det är också i ljuset av den armeniska kyrkans starka position som man bör se traditionen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>att söka rötterna tillbaka till Noas son Jafet och därmed (med hjälp av religionen) rättfärdiga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sin närvaro i det historiska Armenien. Kanske har kyrkans roll ändå varit än starkare utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska territoriet. De många armenier som genom historiens lopp levt utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hemlandet har ändå bibehållit en utpräglad känsla av etnisk egenart, generation efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>generation. Man har exempelvis betecknat kyrkan som ”det frånvarande fosterlandets synbara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>själ”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkans lära och tradition</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Trots att vissa traditioner har levt kvar sedan tiden innan kristendomens ankomst och mer
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>eller mindre har blivit accepterade av kyrkan är den armeniska läran grundad på Bibeln och de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre första allmänna (ekumeniska) kyrkomötena.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Två särarter i den armenisk-kristna traditionen är dels det s k djuroffret, matal, och dels det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>symboliska livsträdet. Djuroffret härstammar från förkristen tid, men tillämpas fortfarande på
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vissa platser. Dock ses det idag snarare som en sedvänja än en religiös handling och det finns
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>en tendens från kyrkans håll att förtiga matal-ceremonin, men man kan inte bortse ifrån att
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan på ett tidigt stadium godkände offrandet och även reglerade det i sina religiösa lagar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Livsträdet å sin sida, är ett bra exempel på den religiösa och kulturella kontinuitet som präglar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska området. Från den tidiga Urartu-kulturens många bilder av livsträdet, via
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenisk ”trädkult”, till dyrkan av Kristi kors som livsträdet har den förkristna symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”slussats in” i den kristna läran.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vid det första kyrkomötet i Nicaea år 325 representerades armenierna av Grigor,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>upplysaren, och de centrala punkterna var beslutet att Fadern, Sonen och den Helige Anden är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre personer som tillsammans bildar en gudom. Detta är en av grundpelarna i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>läran, liksom den trosbekännelse som formulerades vid mötet och som sjungs i varje armenisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mässa.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkomötet i Efesus år 431, det tredje i ordningen, konstaterade att Kristus inte bara var en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människa som utgjorde Guds tempel, utan att Kristus är Guds son och att därmed Maria inte
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bara är Kristi moder utan också Guds moder. Detta är en ståndpunkt som även den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan fasthåller, liksom majoriteten av mötets deltagare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det fjärde kyrkomötet, som hölls år 451 i Kalcedon, saknade armenisk närvaro, då de låg i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>strid med perserna vid Avarayr. När de senare fick del av mötets beslut förkastade de detta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Man kunde dels inte godta den romerske påven Leos ståndpunkt att påven av Rom skulle vara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkans överhuvud. Mötet proklamerade också tron på Kristi dubbla natur, den mänskliga och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den gudomliga. Den armeniska kyrkan hävdar istället ”tron på en enda förenad natur hos
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds enfödde son”. Detta kom att kallas den monofysitiska läran, och lever idag kvar även i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>exempelvis den koptiska och den etiopiska kyrkan.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armeniska kyrkans sakrament</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I den armeniska kyrkan räknar man till sju sakrament av vilka tre (dopet, konfirmationen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ordinationen) endast kan tas emot en gång. De sju sakramenten är:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dopet – det grundläggande sakramentet. Genom dopet förenas man med Kristi kropp och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inlemmas i Kristi kyrka. Man får syndernas förlåtelse och blir värdig att ta emot de övriga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Myron-smörjelsen/konfirmationen – följer omedelbart efter dopet. Sätter den döpta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människan i stånd att möta världens prövningar och frestelser. Nu mottager hon den helig
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anden, vilket gör henne redo att bekänna den kristna tron.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden – en mötesplats för de kristna, ett enhetens sakrament. Den plats där Kristus föder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>lemmarna i sin kropp och förenar dem med sig själv. De yttre, synliga tecknen är (det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>osyrade) brödet och vinet, som mottas av de kristna efter att ha helgats av prästen. Brödet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vinet förvandlas visserligen inte fysiskt till kött och blod, och Kristus är inte fysiskt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>närvarande, men han är det andligt.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden är en andlig reningsprocess och endast den som tror och som ångrar sina synder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kan ta del av nattvarden, annars kan man inte få del av välsignelsen. Följden blir andlig skada
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och fördömelse, men för den som bekänner sina synder blir nattvarden en överlåtelsehandling.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den som vill deltaga i den heliga måltiden måste alltså först bikta sig, ta emot absolution
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(förlåtelse) och visa att man vill göra bättring. Man måste också fasta från midnatt innan man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>går till nattvarden, den ska nämligen vara det första man tar i munnen den dagen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Bikten och botgöringen – till för dem som behöver förlåtelse för de synder de begått efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dopet. Sakramentet består av tre delar; botfärdigheten, bikten inför prästen, som uttalar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>absolutionen, samt avlösningen. Absolutionen kan endast uttalas av en präst eller någon annan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>högre kyrklig ämbetsman, vilka fått myndigheten att göra detta genom den apostoliska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>successionen. Prästen handlar här som Guds tjänare, inte som egen person. Det är endast de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som verkligen ångrar sig som kan få absolution.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ordinationen – avskiljer en medlem av Kristi kropp till en särskild tjänst inom kyrkan. Den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armeniska kyrkan har åtta olika ordinationer, fyra lägre och fyra högre. De lägre är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dörrvaktare, föreläsare, edsvärare och lampbärare. De högre är diakon, präst, biskop, samt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>katolikos.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Äktenskapet – en varaktig förening mellan man och kvinna, liksom föreningen mellan Kristus
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och kyrkan är varaktig. Äktenskapet är en förbindelse instiftad av Gud och räknas därför till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten. Idealet är egentligen kyskhet, men ”om de inte kan behärska sig bör de gifta sig;
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det är bättre att gifta sig än att brinna av åtrå” (1 Kor 7:9). Målet för äktenskapet är att skaffa
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>barn, som ska bli nya medlemmar i kyrkan. Till skillnad från de andra sakramenten finns inga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>yttre ceremonier för äktenskapet, då det innehåller sådant som inte helt ryms inom en religiös
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ram. Äktenskapets yttre sida består snarare i att man börjar leva på ett nytt sätt, än att man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>genomgår en högtidlig ceremoni. I teorin kan äktenskapet endast upplösas genom döden och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett nytt äktenskap med en skild person medan den förre maken ännu är i livet är ett brott mot
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds lag.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sjuksmörjelsen – det sjunde sakramentet, vilket handlar om en förberedelse inför döden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den gudomliga liturgin</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armenisk liturgi är fylld av vördnad för det heliga. Alla böner och ceremonier bär något av en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”klassisk skönhet” i sina utformningar. Liturgin fyller församlingen med glädje och triumf
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och allt är i botten ett uttryck för det hemlighetsfulla skeende då Gud blev till människa.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska liturgin kan delas in i tre delar; den första delen är en</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>förberedelsegudstjänst, där prästen klär sig i mässkruden och förbereder nattvarden. Del två
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är katekumenernas gudstjänst (katekumener var människor som ännu inte döpts in i den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>fornkristna församlingen och därför inte fick ta nattvarden). Den tredje delen är de troendes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gudstjänst, där nattvarden utdelas.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Liksom så mycket annat när det gäller armenierna har liturgin rötter långt tillbaka i tiden, i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den urkristna gudstjänsten. Redan på 100-talet började man fira gudstjänst efter bestämda
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>former och på 300-talet hade liturgier utformats i grekiska, koptiska syrianska och armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkor.</p>

2 CONT <p>[edit] Legendary origin</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The origin of the Mamikonians is shrouded in the mists of antiquity. Moses of Chorene in his Primary History of Armenia (5th or 6th century) claims that three centuries earlier two Chinese noblemen
2 CONC , Mamik and Konak, rose against their half-brother, Chenbakur, the Emperor of Chenk, or China. They were defeated and fled to the king of Parthia who, braving the Emperor's demands to extradite the cu
2 CONC lprits, sent them to live in Armenia, where Mamik became the progenitor of the Mamikonians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Another 5th-century Armenian historian, Pawstos Buzand, seconded the story. In his History of Armenia, he twice mentions that the Mamikonians descended from the Han dynasty of China and as such wer
2 CONC e not inferior to the Arshakid rulers of Armenia. This genealogical legend may have been part of the Mamikonians' political agenda, as it served to add prestige to their name. Although it echoes the B
2 CONC agratids' claim of Davidic descent and the Artsruni's claim of the royal Assyrian ancestry, some Armenian historians tended to interprete it as something more than a piece of genealogical mythology.[1
2 CONC ] A theory from the 1920s postulated that the Chenk mentioned in the Armenian sources were not the Chinese but a different ethnic group from Transoxania, such as the Tocharians.[1] Edward Gibbon in hi
2 CONC s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire also believed that the founder of Mamikonian clan was not Chinese but merely from the territory of the Chinese Empire and ascribes a Scythian 
2 CONC origin to Mamgon stating that at the time the borders of the Chinese Empire reached as far West as Sogdiana.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Today, some historians are of the opinion that the Mamikonians were probably descended from chieftans of the Tzans (Chanik - ?????/????? - in medieval Armenian, Tzannoi in medieval Greek). The Tzan
2 CONC s[3] were a tribe that once inhabited a mountainous region to the south of Trebizond. They postulate that the tradition of the Chinese origin arose out of the similarity of the name Chanik to the Arme
2 CONC nian word for China, Chen-k.[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Early history</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The first known Mamikonid lord, or nakhararq, about whom anything certain is known was a certain Vatche Mamikonian (fl. 330-339). The family reappears in chronicles in 355, when the bulk of their l
2 CONC ands lay in Tayk. At that point the family chief was Vasak Mamikonian, a commander-in-chief (sparapet) of Armenia. Later, the office of sparapet would become hereditary possession of the Mamikonians. 
2 CONC Vasak was in charge of the Armenian defense against Persia but was eventually defeated through the treachery of Marujan Ardzruni (c. 367-368).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Following that defeat, Vasak's brother Vahan Mamikonian and multiple other feudal lords defected to the Persian side. The Emperor Valens, however, interfered in Armenian affairs and had the office 
2 CONC of sparapet bestowed on Vasak's son Mushegh Mamikonian in 370. Four years later Varazdat, a new king, confirmed Musel in office. The latter was subsequently assassinated on behest of Sembat Saharuni w
2 CONC ho replaced him as sparapet of Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>

2 CONT <p>Upon the queen's demise in 384, Enmanuel Mamikonian was proclaimed Regent of Armenia pending the minority of her son Arsaces III and had the infant king married to his daughter Vardandukh. It was E

2 CONT <p>[edit] Vartan Mamikonian</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hamazasp Mamikonian was recorded as the family leader in 393. His wife is known to have been Sahakanoush, daughter of Saint Sahak the Great and descendant of the Arsacid kings. They had a son, Sain
2 CONC t Vartan Mamikonian, who is revered as one of the greatest military and spiritual leaders of ancient Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Vartan became Sparapet in 432, the Persians summoned him to Ctesiphon, forcing him to convert to Zoroastrianism. Upon his return to home in 450, Vartan repudiated the Persian religion and ins
2 CONC tigated a great Armenian rebellion against their Sassanian overlords. Although he died in the doomed Battle of Vartanantz (451), the continued insurrection led by Vahan Mamikonian, the son of Vartan's
2 CONC  brother, resulted in the restoration of Armenian autonomy with the Nvarsak Treaty (484), thus guaranteeing the survival of Armenian statehood in later centuries. Saint Vartan is commemorated by an eq
2 CONC uestrian statue in Yerevan.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the country's subjugation by the Persians, Mamikonians sided with the Roman Empire, with many family members entering Byzantine service. Not only did they rise to the highest offices of Const
2 CONC antinople, but even some of the emperors - conceivably Leo the Armenian and Basil I - could have been their descendants. Theodora the Byzantine regent and her brothers Bardas and Petronas the Patricia
2 CONC n were also of Mamikonian heritage. Unsurprisingly, Mamikonians form a crucial link in the postulated descent of modern European nobility from antiquity.

2 CONT <p>Isaac or Sahak of Armenia (338–439) was Catholicos (or Patriarch) of Armenia. He is sometimes known as "Isaac the Great," and as "Սահակ Պարթև / Sahak Parthev" in Armenian, owing to his 
2 CONC Parthian origin.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Isaac was son of the Christian Saint Narses and descended from the family of Saint Gregory the Illuminator. He was the fifth catholicos of the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia after St. Gregory I the Enl
2 CONC ightener (301–325), St. Aristaces I (325–333), St. Vrtanes I (333–341) and St. Husik I (341–347). Left an orphan at a very early age, he received an excellent literary education in Constantino
2 CONC ple, particularly in the Eastern languages. After his election as patriarch he devoted himself to the religious and scientific training of his people. Armenia was then passing through a grave crisis. 
2 CONC In 387 it had lost its independence and been divided between the Byzantine Empire and Persia; each division had at its head an Armenian but feudatory king. In the Byzantine territory, however, the Arm
2 CONC enians were forbidden the use of the Syriac language, until then exclusively used in divine worship: for this the Greek language was to be substituted, and the country gradually hellenized; in the Per
2 CONC sian districts, on the contrary, Greek was absolutely prohibited, while Syriac was greatly favoured. In this way the ancient culture of the Armenians was in danger of disappearing and national unity w
2 CONC as seriously compromised.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>To save both Isaac invented, with the aid of Saint Mesrob, the Armenian alphabet and began to translate the Christian Bible; their translation from the Syriac Peshito was revised by means of the Se
2 CONC ptuagint, and even, it seems, from the Hebrew text (between 410 and 430). The liturgy also, hitherto Syrian was translated into Armenian, drawing at the same time on the liturgy of Saint Basil of Caes
2 CONC area, so as to obtain for the new service a national colour. Isaac had already established schools for higher education with the aid of disciples whom he had sent to study at Edessa, Melitene, Constan
2 CONC tinople, and elsewhere. Through them he now had the principal masterpieces of Greek and Syrian Christian literature translated, e.g. the writings of Athanasius, Cyril of Jerusalem, Basil, the two Greg
2 CONC orys (Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa), John Chrysostom, Ephrem the Syrian, etc. Armenian literature in its golden age was, therefore, mainly a borrowed literature.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Through Isaac's efforts the churches and monasteries destroyed by the Persians were rebuilt, education was cared for in a generous way, Zoroastrianism which Shah Yazdegerd I tried to set up was cas
2 CONC t out, and three councils held to re-establish ecclesiastical discipline. Isaac is said to have been the author of liturgical hymns.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Two letters, written by him to Theodosius II and to Atticus of Constantinople, have been preserved. A third letter addressed to Saint Proclus of Constantinople was not written by him, but dates fro
2 CONC m the tenth century. Neither did he have any share, as was wrongly ascribed to him, in the First Council of Ephesus of 431, though, in consequence of disputes which arose in Armenia between the follow
2 CONC ers of Nestorius and the disciples of Acacius of Melitene and Rabbula, Isaac and his church did appeal to Constantinople and through Saint Proclus obtained the desired explanations.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A man of enlightened piety and of very austere life, Isaac owed his deposition by the king in 426 to his great independence of character. In 430, he was allowed to resume his patriarchal throne. In
2 CONC  his extreme old age he seems to have withdrawn into solitude, dying at the age of 110. The precise date of his death is not known, but it seems to have occurred between 439 and 441. Hovhannes Draskha

2 CONT <p>Catholicos or Patriarch of Armenia (338-439), otherwise known as ISAAC THE GREAT and sometimes as PARTHEV owing to his Parthian origin. He was son of St. Narses and descended from the family of St.
2 CONC  Grergory the Illuminator. Left an orphan at a very early age, he received in Constantinople an excellent literary education, particularly in the Eastern languages. After his election as patriarch he 
2 CONC devoted himself to the religious and scientific training of his people. Armenia was then passing through a grave crisis. In 387 it had lost its independence and been divided between the Byzantine Empi
2 CONC re and Persia; each division had at its head an Armenian but feudatory king. In the Byzantine territory, however, the Armenians were forbidden the use of the Syriac language, until then exclusively us
2 CONC ed in Divine worship: for this the Greek language was to be substituted, and the country gradually hellenized in the Persian districts, on the contrary, Greek was absolutely prohibited, while Syriac w
2 CONC as greatly favoured in this way the ancient culture of the Armenians was in danger of disappearing and national unity was seriously compromised. To save both Isaac invented with the aid of St. Mesrop,
2 CONC  the Armenian alphabet and began to translate the Bible; their translation from the Syriac Peshito was revised by means of the Septuagint, and even, it seems, from the Hebrew text (between 410 and 430
2 CONC ). The liturgy also, hitherto Syrian was translated into Armenian, drawing at the same time on the Liturgy of St. Basil of Caesarea, so as to obtain for the new service a national colour. Isaac had al
2 CONC ready established schools for higher education with the aid of disciples whom he had sent to study at Edessa, Melitene, Byzantium, and elsewhere. Through them he now had the principal masterpieces of 
2 CONC Greek and Syrian Christian literature translated, e.g. the writings of Athanasius, Cyril of Jerusalem, Basil, the two Gregorys (of Nazianzus and of Nyssa), John Chrysostom, Ephrem, etc.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armenian literature in its golden age was, therefore, mainly a borrowed literature. Through Isaac's efforts the churches and monasteries destroyed by the Persians were rebuilt, education was cared 
2 CONC for in a generous way, the pagan worship of Ormuzd which Shah Yezdigerd tried to set up was cast out, and three councils held to re-establish ecclesiastical discipline. Isaac is said to have been the 
2 CONC author of liturgical hymns. Two letters, written by him to Theodosius II and to Atticus of Constantinople, have been preserved. A third letter addressed to St. Proclus of Constantinople was not writte

2 CONT <p>Saint Nerses I the Great (Armenian: Սուրբ Ներսես Ա. Մեծ ) was an Armenian Catholicos (or Patriarch) who lived in the fourth century. He was the father of another catholicos, Saint Sa
2 CONC hak I. His father was At'anagenes and his mother was Bambish, the sister of King Tiran.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Born of the royal Gregorid stock, he spent his youth in Caesarea where he married Sanducht, a Mamikonian princess. After the death of his wife, he was appointed sword-bearer to King Arshak II. A fe
2 CONC w years later, having entered the ecclesiastical state, he was elected catholicos in 353.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His patriarchate marks a new era in Armenian history. Till then the Church had been more or less identified with the royal family and the nobles; Nerses brought it into closer connection with the p
2 CONC eople. At the Council of Ashtishat he promulgated numerous laws on marriage, fast days, and divine worship. He built schools and hospitals, and sent monks throughout the land to preach the Gospel.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nerses held a synod at Ashtishat that, among other things, forbade people to marry their first cousin and forbade mutilation and other extreme actions in mourning.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some of these reforms drew upon him the king's displeasure, and he was exiled, supposedly to Edessa. It was probably at some point during the later part of Arshak's reign that Nerses went to Consta
2 CONC ntinople to ensure the emperor's support of Armenia against the Persians. According to P'awstos Buzandac'i's account Emperor Valens became outraged at Nerses condemning his following the teachings of 
2 CONC Arius and sent Nerses into exile.[3] While Nerses was in exile Xad was the leader of the church in Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Upon the accession of pro-Arian King Pap (369) he returned to his see. Pap proved a dissolute and unworthy ruler and Nerses forbade him entrance to the church. Under the pretence of seeking a recon
2 CONC ciliation, Pap invited Nerses to his table and reportedly poisoned him in 373. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Narses
2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>Det historiska Armenien</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det ursprungliga Armenien upptog, ett flertal sekel f Kr, ett stort område öster om Mindre
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Asien och söder om Kaukasus. Svarta havet och Kaspiska havet ligger i nordväst, respektive
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nordost. Söderut låg parternas och persernas mäktiga riken. Den kanske mest kända symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>för Armenien är berget Ararat, där Noaks ark ska ha strandat efter sin långa resa. (Idag ligger
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>visserligen berget strax innanför den turkiska gränsen, men det är fullt synligt från många
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>delar av landet.)</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Namnet Ararat är nära besläktat med Urartu, assyriernas namn på det kungarike som en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gång låg på samma plats som det historiska Armenien. Detta rike nådde sin höjdpunkt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>omkring 800-talet till 500-talet f Kr och var då en stark konkurrent till det mäktiga Assyrien,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>om makten i området. En annan historiskt och symboliskt viktig plats är Araxesdalen, som är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mycket bördig och som av vissa påstås vara det ursprungliga Edens lustgård.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>När Urartu-riket gick under ca 590 f Kr kom olika stammar invandrande till området.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tillsammans kallade de sig för Hayastan, vilket fortfarande är det armeniska språkets
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>benämning på Armenien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tre hjältar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska historien skulle kunna skrivas mycket lång och händelserik, men de första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>femhundra åren e Kr skulle kunna sammanfattas runt tre historiska hjältar, vilka alla har sin
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>plats i den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>189 f Kr utgjorde delar av Armenien en provins inom det seleukidiska riket, men detta år
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inleddes även något som skulle bli den armeniska storhetstiden. Arthases (Artaxias) utropade
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nämligen en del av området till ett självständigt kungadöme, vilket under den närmaste
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>följande tiden fick flera efterföljare. Med tiden kom de att närma sig varandra, för att sedan,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under kung Tigran den store (95 – 56 f Kr) bli enade till en nation. Det var också under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>honom som det historiska Armenien nådde sin geografiskt sett största utbredning, omfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bland annat delar av Mesopotamien, Syrien, Cilicien och ända ner mot Palestina. Visserligen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hann riket även minska en del under kung Tigrans styre, då romarna erövrade delar av landet,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>men detta talas det inte mycket om, utan det är enandet av landet som är det viktiga.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under åren 287 – 294 och 297 – 330 e Kr styrdes Armenien av kung Tirdat III. Det var
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under dennes tid som St Grigor (Gregorius), upplysaren, enligt traditionen kom till landet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ska ha omvänt kungen (och därmed hela folket) till kristendomen. Detta ska ha skett år 301
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och med stöd av detta hävdar armenierna att de utgör den äldsta kristna staten i världen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenierna det äldsta kristna folket.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Från år 430 och under ett par århundraden framöver var Armenien delat mellan Bysans i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>väst och perserna i öst. De senare inledde förföljelser mot folket för att få dem att övergå till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den persiska zoroastrismen. En nationell, armenisk armé samlades dock under general Vardan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mamikonians ledning för att kämpa mot perserna. År 451 stod ett avgörande slag vid Avrayr,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>där visserligen armenierna förlorade mot den överlägsna persiska krigsmaskinen och där
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>general Vardan dog, men armenierna garanterades rätten att förbli kristna under persisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>överhöghet. Vardan är en förebild för folkets kamp mot olika förtryckare och kampen för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>rätten att vara kristna.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ett lidande folk</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Förutom de dryga sex seklerna kring Kristi födelse har armenierna nästan alltid varit styrda av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(och ofta uppdelade mellan) andra riken. Den längsta perioden av främmande styre och även
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den som kanske har satt mest spår i dagens armeniska identitet var den turkiska/ottomanska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tiden. Redan under 1000-talets andra hälft trängde turkarna in i området och tog makten för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett par hundra år. Efter ett antal andra härskare från olika håll kom sedan Armenien åter under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>turkiskt styre på 1500-talet, något som skulle sätta ett outplånligt spår i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>historien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Genom historien har återkommande upprorsförsök mot olika ockupationsmakter så gott
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som alltid brutalt slagits ned. Detta har givit den armeniska identiteten en ständig närvaro av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det historiska lidande som folket gått igenom under århundradenas lopp. Det finns dock ett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>särskilt tillfälle som varit upphov till värre lidande än någonsin tidigare. Under 1880-talet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hade en nationell armenisk rörelse uppstått, något som inte sågs med blida ögon av de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>styrande turkarna. Svåra förföljelser kom till följd av detta, vilka kulminerade i deportation
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och systematisk utrotning av omkring 1,5 miljoner människor under och strax efter första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>världskriget. Denna ofattbara tragedi lever kvar i näst intill varje armenier idag, och går ofta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under namnet ”massakern”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Att detta ”historiens första folkmord” idag kan vara så okänt är skrämmande. Relativt sett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>var massmorden på armenier större än nazisternas utrotningsförsök av judar. De 1,5 miljoner
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som avrättades utgjorde en större del av folket än de ca 6 miljoner judar som fick sätta livet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>till under andra världskriget.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkan ger identitet</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Då armenierna saknat kungar och andra oberoende styren under större delen av historien har
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ledarskapet för nationen, och därmed också centralpunkten för identifikationen, tagits över av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska apostoliska kyrkan. De mest begåvade intellektuella har ofta blivit präster och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under lång tid var den armeniska utbildningen underställd kyrkan. Tillsammans med den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gemensamma historien av lidande och det egna språket utgör den kristna tron grundpelarna i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska kyrkan präglas av två starka särdrag. Det första är kyrkans strukturella
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>demokratiska uppbyggnad. Liksom flera andra kyrkor är den armeniska kyrkan idag uppdelad
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>i (fyra) patriarkat, i vilka patriarkerna (katolikoserna) har en stark ställning som talesmän för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska befolkningen i respektive område. Det råder dock inga motsättningar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>patriarkerna emellan, utan snarare tvärtom. I ett tal uttryckte en av dem sig på följande sätt:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”Vi är en kyrka. Vi har varit en kyrka genom århundraden. Vi ska fortsätta att vara en kyrka i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kommande århundrade.” Den, med historiska mått mätt, demokratiska och allomfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan har säkerligen många gånger motverkat splittring hos folket. Det andra karaktärsdraget
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är den på vissa punkter näst intill unika kristna läran. Framför allt är det den monofysitiska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ståndpunkten som utmärker sig, vilken utvecklas senare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det är också i ljuset av den armeniska kyrkans starka position som man bör se traditionen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>att söka rötterna tillbaka till Noas son Jafet och därmed (med hjälp av religionen) rättfärdiga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sin närvaro i det historiska Armenien. Kanske har kyrkans roll ändå varit än starkare utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska territoriet. De många armenier som genom historiens lopp levt utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hemlandet har ändå bibehållit en utpräglad känsla av etnisk egenart, generation efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>generation. Man har exempelvis betecknat kyrkan som ”det frånvarande fosterlandets synbara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>själ”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkans lära och tradition</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Trots att vissa traditioner har levt kvar sedan tiden innan kristendomens ankomst och mer
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>eller mindre har blivit accepterade av kyrkan är den armeniska läran grundad på Bibeln och de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre första allmänna (ekumeniska) kyrkomötena.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Två särarter i den armenisk-kristna traditionen är dels det s k djuroffret, matal, och dels det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>symboliska livsträdet. Djuroffret härstammar från förkristen tid, men tillämpas fortfarande på
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vissa platser. Dock ses det idag snarare som en sedvänja än en religiös handling och det finns
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>en tendens från kyrkans håll att förtiga matal-ceremonin, men man kan inte bortse ifrån att
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan på ett tidigt stadium godkände offrandet och även reglerade det i sina religiösa lagar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Livsträdet å sin sida, är ett bra exempel på den religiösa och kulturella kontinuitet som präglar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska området. Från den tidiga Urartu-kulturens många bilder av livsträdet, via
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenisk ”trädkult”, till dyrkan av Kristi kors som livsträdet har den förkristna symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”slussats in” i den kristna läran.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vid det första kyrkomötet i Nicaea år 325 representerades armenierna av Grigor,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>upplysaren, och de centrala punkterna var beslutet att Fadern, Sonen och den Helige Anden är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre personer som tillsammans bildar en gudom. Detta är en av grundpelarna i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>läran, liksom den trosbekännelse som formulerades vid mötet och som sjungs i varje armenisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mässa.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkomötet i Efesus år 431, det tredje i ordningen, konstaterade att Kristus inte bara var en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människa som utgjorde Guds tempel, utan att Kristus är Guds son och att därmed Maria inte
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bara är Kristi moder utan också Guds moder. Detta är en ståndpunkt som även den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan fasthåller, liksom majoriteten av mötets deltagare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det fjärde kyrkomötet, som hölls år 451 i Kalcedon, saknade armenisk närvaro, då de låg i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>strid med perserna vid Avarayr. När de senare fick del av mötets beslut förkastade de detta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Man kunde dels inte godta den romerske påven Leos ståndpunkt att påven av Rom skulle vara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkans överhuvud. Mötet proklamerade också tron på Kristi dubbla natur, den mänskliga och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den gudomliga. Den armeniska kyrkan hävdar istället ”tron på en enda förenad natur hos
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds enfödde son”. Detta kom att kallas den monofysitiska läran, och lever idag kvar även i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>exempelvis den koptiska och den etiopiska kyrkan.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armeniska kyrkans sakrament</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I den armeniska kyrkan räknar man till sju sakrament av vilka tre (dopet, konfirmationen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ordinationen) endast kan tas emot en gång. De sju sakramenten är:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dopet – det grundläggande sakramentet. Genom dopet förenas man med Kristi kropp och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inlemmas i Kristi kyrka. Man får syndernas förlåtelse och blir värdig att ta emot de övriga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Myron-smörjelsen/konfirmationen – följer omedelbart efter dopet. Sätter den döpta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människan i stånd att möta världens prövningar och frestelser. Nu mottager hon den helig
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anden, vilket gör henne redo att bekänna den kristna tron.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden – en mötesplats för de kristna, ett enhetens sakrament. Den plats där Kristus föder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>lemmarna i sin kropp och förenar dem med sig själv. De yttre, synliga tecknen är (det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>osyrade) brödet och vinet, som mottas av de kristna efter att ha helgats av prästen. Brödet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vinet förvandlas visserligen inte fysiskt till kött och blod, och Kristus är inte fysiskt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>närvarande, men han är det andligt.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden är en andlig reningsprocess och endast den som tror och som ångrar sina synder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kan ta del av nattvarden, annars kan man inte få del av välsignelsen. Följden blir andlig skada
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och fördömelse, men för den som bekänner sina synder blir nattvarden en överlåtelsehandling.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den som vill deltaga i den heliga måltiden måste alltså först bikta sig, ta emot absolution
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(förlåtelse) och visa att man vill göra bättring. Man måste också fasta från midnatt innan man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>går till nattvarden, den ska nämligen vara det första man tar i munnen den dagen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Bikten och botgöringen – till för dem som behöver förlåtelse för de synder de begått efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dopet. Sakramentet består av tre delar; botfärdigheten, bikten inför prästen, som uttalar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>absolutionen, samt avlösningen. Absolutionen kan endast uttalas av en präst eller någon annan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>högre kyrklig ämbetsman, vilka fått myndigheten att göra detta genom den apostoliska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>successionen. Prästen handlar här som Guds tjänare, inte som egen person. Det är endast de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som verkligen ångrar sig som kan få absolution.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ordinationen – avskiljer en medlem av Kristi kropp till en särskild tjänst inom kyrkan. Den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armeniska kyrkan har åtta olika ordinationer, fyra lägre och fyra högre. De lägre är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dörrvaktare, föreläsare, edsvärare och lampbärare. De högre är diakon, präst, biskop, samt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>katolikos.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Äktenskapet – en varaktig förening mellan man och kvinna, liksom föreningen mellan Kristus
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och kyrkan är varaktig. Äktenskapet är en förbindelse instiftad av Gud och räknas därför till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten. Idealet är egentligen kyskhet, men ”om de inte kan behärska sig bör de gifta sig;
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det är bättre att gifta sig än att brinna av åtrå” (1 Kor 7:9). Målet för äktenskapet är att skaffa
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>barn, som ska bli nya medlemmar i kyrkan. Till skillnad från de andra sakramenten finns inga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>yttre ceremonier för äktenskapet, då det innehåller sådant som inte helt ryms inom en religiös
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ram. Äktenskapets yttre sida består snarare i att man börjar leva på ett nytt sätt, än att man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>genomgår en högtidlig ceremoni. I teorin kan äktenskapet endast upplösas genom döden och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett nytt äktenskap med en skild person medan den förre maken ännu är i livet är ett brott mot
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds lag.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sjuksmörjelsen – det sjunde sakramentet, vilket handlar om en förberedelse inför döden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den gudomliga liturgin</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armenisk liturgi är fylld av vördnad för det heliga. Alla böner och ceremonier bär något av en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”klassisk skönhet” i sina utformningar. Liturgin fyller församlingen med glädje och triumf
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och allt är i botten ett uttryck för det hemlighetsfulla skeende då Gud blev till människa.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska liturgin kan delas in i tre delar; den första delen är en</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>förberedelsegudstjänst, där prästen klär sig i mässkruden och förbereder nattvarden. Del två
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är katekumenernas gudstjänst (katekumener var människor som ännu inte döpts in i den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>fornkristna församlingen och därför inte fick ta nattvarden). Den tredje delen är de troendes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gudstjänst, där nattvarden utdelas.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Liksom så mycket annat när det gäller armenierna har liturgin rötter långt tillbaka i tiden, i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den urkristna gudstjänsten. Redan på 100-talet började man fira gudstjänst efter bestämda
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>former och på 300-talet hade liturgier utformats i grekiska, koptiska syrianska och armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkor.</p>

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His patriarchate marks a new era in Armenian history. Till then the Church had been more or less identified with the royal family and the nobles; Nerses brought it into closer connection with the p

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nerses held a synod at Ashtishat that, among other things, forbade people to marry their first cousin and forbade mutilation and other extreme actions in mourning.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some of these reforms drew upon him the king's displeasure, and he was exiled, supposedly to Edessa. It was probably at some point during the later part of Arshak's reign that Nerses went to Consta
2 CONC ntinople to ensure the emperor's support of Armenia against the Persians. According to P'awstos Buzandac'i's account Emperor Valens became outraged at Nerses condemning his following the teachings of 
2 CONC Arius and sent Nerses into exile.[3] While Nerses was in exile Xad was the leader of the church in Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Upon the accession of pro-Arian King Pap (369) he returned to his see. Pap proved a dissolute and unworthy ruler and Nerses forbade him entrance to the church. Under the pretence of seeking a recon

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det historiska Armenien</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det ursprungliga Armenien upptog, ett flertal sekel f Kr, ett stort område öster om Mindre
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Asien och söder om Kaukasus. Svarta havet och Kaspiska havet ligger i nordväst, respektive
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nordost. Söderut låg parternas och persernas mäktiga riken. Den kanske mest kända symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>för Armenien är berget Ararat, där Noaks ark ska ha strandat efter sin långa resa. (Idag ligger
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>visserligen berget strax innanför den turkiska gränsen, men det är fullt synligt från många
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>delar av landet.)</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Namnet Ararat är nära besläktat med Urartu, assyriernas namn på det kungarike som en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gång låg på samma plats som det historiska Armenien. Detta rike nådde sin höjdpunkt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>omkring 800-talet till 500-talet f Kr och var då en stark konkurrent till det mäktiga Assyrien,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>om makten i området. En annan historiskt och symboliskt viktig plats är Araxesdalen, som är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mycket bördig och som av vissa påstås vara det ursprungliga Edens lustgård.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>När Urartu-riket gick under ca 590 f Kr kom olika stammar invandrande till området.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tillsammans kallade de sig för Hayastan, vilket fortfarande är det armeniska språkets
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>benämning på Armenien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tre hjältar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska historien skulle kunna skrivas mycket lång och händelserik, men de första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>femhundra åren e Kr skulle kunna sammanfattas runt tre historiska hjältar, vilka alla har sin
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>plats i den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>189 f Kr utgjorde delar av Armenien en provins inom det seleukidiska riket, men detta år
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inleddes även något som skulle bli den armeniska storhetstiden. Arthases (Artaxias) utropade
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nämligen en del av området till ett självständigt kungadöme, vilket under den närmaste
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>följande tiden fick flera efterföljare. Med tiden kom de att närma sig varandra, för att sedan,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under kung Tigran den store (95 – 56 f Kr) bli enade till en nation. Det var också under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>honom som det historiska Armenien nådde sin geografiskt sett största utbredning, omfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bland annat delar av Mesopotamien, Syrien, Cilicien och ända ner mot Palestina. Visserligen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hann riket även minska en del under kung Tigrans styre, då romarna erövrade delar av landet,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>men detta talas det inte mycket om, utan det är enandet av landet som är det viktiga.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under åren 287 – 294 och 297 – 330 e Kr styrdes Armenien av kung Tirdat III. Det var
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under dennes tid som St Grigor (Gregorius), upplysaren, enligt traditionen kom till landet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ska ha omvänt kungen (och därmed hela folket) till kristendomen. Detta ska ha skett år 301
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och med stöd av detta hävdar armenierna att de utgör den äldsta kristna staten i världen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenierna det äldsta kristna folket.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Från år 430 och under ett par århundraden framöver var Armenien delat mellan Bysans i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>väst och perserna i öst. De senare inledde förföljelser mot folket för att få dem att övergå till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den persiska zoroastrismen. En nationell, armenisk armé samlades dock under general Vardan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mamikonians ledning för att kämpa mot perserna. År 451 stod ett avgörande slag vid Avrayr,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>där visserligen armenierna förlorade mot den överlägsna persiska krigsmaskinen och där
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>general Vardan dog, men armenierna garanterades rätten att förbli kristna under persisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>överhöghet. Vardan är en förebild för folkets kamp mot olika förtryckare och kampen för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>rätten att vara kristna.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ett lidande folk</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Förutom de dryga sex seklerna kring Kristi födelse har armenierna nästan alltid varit styrda av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(och ofta uppdelade mellan) andra riken. Den längsta perioden av främmande styre och även
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den som kanske har satt mest spår i dagens armeniska identitet var den turkiska/ottomanska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tiden. Redan under 1000-talets andra hälft trängde turkarna in i området och tog makten för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett par hundra år. Efter ett antal andra härskare från olika håll kom sedan Armenien åter under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>turkiskt styre på 1500-talet, något som skulle sätta ett outplånligt spår i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>historien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Genom historien har återkommande upprorsförsök mot olika ockupationsmakter så gott
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som alltid brutalt slagits ned. Detta har givit den armeniska identiteten en ständig närvaro av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det historiska lidande som folket gått igenom under århundradenas lopp. Det finns dock ett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>särskilt tillfälle som varit upphov till värre lidande än någonsin tidigare. Under 1880-talet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hade en nationell armenisk rörelse uppstått, något som inte sågs med blida ögon av de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>styrande turkarna. Svåra förföljelser kom till följd av detta, vilka kulminerade i deportation
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och systematisk utrotning av omkring 1,5 miljoner människor under och strax efter första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>världskriget. Denna ofattbara tragedi lever kvar i näst intill varje armenier idag, och går ofta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under namnet ”massakern”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Att detta ”historiens första folkmord” idag kan vara så okänt är skrämmande. Relativt sett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>var massmorden på armenier större än nazisternas utrotningsförsök av judar. De 1,5 miljoner
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som avrättades utgjorde en större del av folket än de ca 6 miljoner judar som fick sätta livet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>till under andra världskriget.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkan ger identitet</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Då armenierna saknat kungar och andra oberoende styren under större delen av historien har
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ledarskapet för nationen, och därmed också centralpunkten för identifikationen, tagits över av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska apostoliska kyrkan. De mest begåvade intellektuella har ofta blivit präster och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under lång tid var den armeniska utbildningen underställd kyrkan. Tillsammans med den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gemensamma historien av lidande och det egna språket utgör den kristna tron grundpelarna i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska kyrkan präglas av två starka särdrag. Det första är kyrkans strukturella
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>demokratiska uppbyggnad. Liksom flera andra kyrkor är den armeniska kyrkan idag uppdelad
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>i (fyra) patriarkat, i vilka patriarkerna (katolikoserna) har en stark ställning som talesmän för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska befolkningen i respektive område. Det råder dock inga motsättningar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>patriarkerna emellan, utan snarare tvärtom. I ett tal uttryckte en av dem sig på följande sätt:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”Vi är en kyrka. Vi har varit en kyrka genom århundraden. Vi ska fortsätta att vara en kyrka i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kommande århundrade.” Den, med historiska mått mätt, demokratiska och allomfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan har säkerligen många gånger motverkat splittring hos folket. Det andra karaktärsdraget
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är den på vissa punkter näst intill unika kristna läran. Framför allt är det den monofysitiska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ståndpunkten som utmärker sig, vilken utvecklas senare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det är också i ljuset av den armeniska kyrkans starka position som man bör se traditionen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>att söka rötterna tillbaka till Noas son Jafet och därmed (med hjälp av religionen) rättfärdiga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sin närvaro i det historiska Armenien. Kanske har kyrkans roll ändå varit än starkare utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska territoriet. De många armenier som genom historiens lopp levt utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hemlandet har ändå bibehållit en utpräglad känsla av etnisk egenart, generation efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>generation. Man har exempelvis betecknat kyrkan som ”det frånvarande fosterlandets synbara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>själ”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkans lära och tradition</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Trots att vissa traditioner har levt kvar sedan tiden innan kristendomens ankomst och mer
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>eller mindre har blivit accepterade av kyrkan är den armeniska läran grundad på Bibeln och de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre första allmänna (ekumeniska) kyrkomötena.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Två särarter i den armenisk-kristna traditionen är dels det s k djuroffret, matal, och dels det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>symboliska livsträdet. Djuroffret härstammar från förkristen tid, men tillämpas fortfarande på
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vissa platser. Dock ses det idag snarare som en sedvänja än en religiös handling och det finns
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>en tendens från kyrkans håll att förtiga matal-ceremonin, men man kan inte bortse ifrån att
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan på ett tidigt stadium godkände offrandet och även reglerade det i sina religiösa lagar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Livsträdet å sin sida, är ett bra exempel på den religiösa och kulturella kontinuitet som präglar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska området. Från den tidiga Urartu-kulturens många bilder av livsträdet, via
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenisk ”trädkult”, till dyrkan av Kristi kors som livsträdet har den förkristna symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”slussats in” i den kristna läran.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vid det första kyrkomötet i Nicaea år 325 representerades armenierna av Grigor,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>upplysaren, och de centrala punkterna var beslutet att Fadern, Sonen och den Helige Anden är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre personer som tillsammans bildar en gudom. Detta är en av grundpelarna i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>läran, liksom den trosbekännelse som formulerades vid mötet och som sjungs i varje armenisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mässa.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkomötet i Efesus år 431, det tredje i ordningen, konstaterade att Kristus inte bara var en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människa som utgjorde Guds tempel, utan att Kristus är Guds son och att därmed Maria inte
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bara är Kristi moder utan också Guds moder. Detta är en ståndpunkt som även den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan fasthåller, liksom majoriteten av mötets deltagare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det fjärde kyrkomötet, som hölls år 451 i Kalcedon, saknade armenisk närvaro, då de låg i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>strid med perserna vid Avarayr. När de senare fick del av mötets beslut förkastade de detta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Man kunde dels inte godta den romerske påven Leos ståndpunkt att påven av Rom skulle vara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkans överhuvud. Mötet proklamerade också tron på Kristi dubbla natur, den mänskliga och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den gudomliga. Den armeniska kyrkan hävdar istället ”tron på en enda förenad natur hos
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds enfödde son”. Detta kom att kallas den monofysitiska läran, och lever idag kvar även i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>exempelvis den koptiska och den etiopiska kyrkan.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armeniska kyrkans sakrament</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I den armeniska kyrkan räknar man till sju sakrament av vilka tre (dopet, konfirmationen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ordinationen) endast kan tas emot en gång. De sju sakramenten är:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dopet – det grundläggande sakramentet. Genom dopet förenas man med Kristi kropp och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inlemmas i Kristi kyrka. Man får syndernas förlåtelse och blir värdig att ta emot de övriga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Myron-smörjelsen/konfirmationen – följer omedelbart efter dopet. Sätter den döpta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människan i stånd att möta världens prövningar och frestelser. Nu mottager hon den helig
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anden, vilket gör henne redo att bekänna den kristna tron.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden – en mötesplats för de kristna, ett enhetens sakrament. Den plats där Kristus föder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>lemmarna i sin kropp och förenar dem med sig själv. De yttre, synliga tecknen är (det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>osyrade) brödet och vinet, som mottas av de kristna efter att ha helgats av prästen. Brödet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vinet förvandlas visserligen inte fysiskt till kött och blod, och Kristus är inte fysiskt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>närvarande, men han är det andligt.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden är en andlig reningsprocess och endast den som tror och som ångrar sina synder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kan ta del av nattvarden, annars kan man inte få del av välsignelsen. Följden blir andlig skada
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och fördömelse, men för den som bekänner sina synder blir nattvarden en överlåtelsehandling.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den som vill deltaga i den heliga måltiden måste alltså först bikta sig, ta emot absolution
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(förlåtelse) och visa att man vill göra bättring. Man måste också fasta från midnatt innan man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>går till nattvarden, den ska nämligen vara det första man tar i munnen den dagen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Bikten och botgöringen – till för dem som behöver förlåtelse för de synder de begått efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dopet. Sakramentet består av tre delar; botfärdigheten, bikten inför prästen, som uttalar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>absolutionen, samt avlösningen. Absolutionen kan endast uttalas av en präst eller någon annan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>högre kyrklig ämbetsman, vilka fått myndigheten att göra detta genom den apostoliska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>successionen. Prästen handlar här som Guds tjänare, inte som egen person. Det är endast de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som verkligen ångrar sig som kan få absolution.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ordinationen – avskiljer en medlem av Kristi kropp till en särskild tjänst inom kyrkan. Den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armeniska kyrkan har åtta olika ordinationer, fyra lägre och fyra högre. De lägre är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dörrvaktare, föreläsare, edsvärare och lampbärare. De högre är diakon, präst, biskop, samt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>katolikos.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Äktenskapet – en varaktig förening mellan man och kvinna, liksom föreningen mellan Kristus
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och kyrkan är varaktig. Äktenskapet är en förbindelse instiftad av Gud och räknas därför till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten. Idealet är egentligen kyskhet, men ”om de inte kan behärska sig bör de gifta sig;
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det är bättre att gifta sig än att brinna av åtrå” (1 Kor 7:9). Målet för äktenskapet är att skaffa
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>barn, som ska bli nya medlemmar i kyrkan. Till skillnad från de andra sakramenten finns inga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>yttre ceremonier för äktenskapet, då det innehåller sådant som inte helt ryms inom en religiös
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ram. Äktenskapets yttre sida består snarare i att man börjar leva på ett nytt sätt, än att man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>genomgår en högtidlig ceremoni. I teorin kan äktenskapet endast upplösas genom döden och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett nytt äktenskap med en skild person medan den förre maken ännu är i livet är ett brott mot
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds lag.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sjuksmörjelsen – det sjunde sakramentet, vilket handlar om en förberedelse inför döden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den gudomliga liturgin</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armenisk liturgi är fylld av vördnad för det heliga. Alla böner och ceremonier bär något av en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”klassisk skönhet” i sina utformningar. Liturgin fyller församlingen med glädje och triumf
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och allt är i botten ett uttryck för det hemlighetsfulla skeende då Gud blev till människa.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska liturgin kan delas in i tre delar; den första delen är en</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>förberedelsegudstjänst, där prästen klär sig i mässkruden och förbereder nattvarden. Del två
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är katekumenernas gudstjänst (katekumener var människor som ännu inte döpts in i den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>fornkristna församlingen och därför inte fick ta nattvarden). Den tredje delen är de troendes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gudstjänst, där nattvarden utdelas.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Liksom så mycket annat när det gäller armenierna har liturgin rötter långt tillbaka i tiden, i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den urkristna gudstjänsten. Redan på 100-talet började man fira gudstjänst efter bestämda
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>former och på 300-talet hade liturgier utformats i grekiska, koptiska syrianska och armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkor.</p>

2 CONT <p>regerade 330-339</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det historiska Armenien</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det ursprungliga Armenien upptog, ett flertal sekel f Kr, ett stort område öster om Mindre
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Asien och söder om Kaukasus. Svarta havet och Kaspiska havet ligger i nordväst, respektive
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nordost. Söderut låg parternas och persernas mäktiga riken. Den kanske mest kända symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>för Armenien är berget Ararat, där Noaks ark ska ha strandat efter sin långa resa. (Idag ligger
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>visserligen berget strax innanför den turkiska gränsen, men det är fullt synligt från många
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>delar av landet.)</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Namnet Ararat är nära besläktat med Urartu, assyriernas namn på det kungarike som en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gång låg på samma plats som det historiska Armenien. Detta rike nådde sin höjdpunkt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>omkring 800-talet till 500-talet f Kr och var då en stark konkurrent till det mäktiga Assyrien,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>om makten i området. En annan historiskt och symboliskt viktig plats är Araxesdalen, som är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mycket bördig och som av vissa påstås vara det ursprungliga Edens lustgård.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>När Urartu-riket gick under ca 590 f Kr kom olika stammar invandrande till området.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tillsammans kallade de sig för Hayastan, vilket fortfarande är det armeniska språkets
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>benämning på Armenien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tre hjältar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska historien skulle kunna skrivas mycket lång och händelserik, men de första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>femhundra åren e Kr skulle kunna sammanfattas runt tre historiska hjältar, vilka alla har sin
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>plats i den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>189 f Kr utgjorde delar av Armenien en provins inom det seleukidiska riket, men detta år
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inleddes även något som skulle bli den armeniska storhetstiden. Arthases (Artaxias) utropade
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nämligen en del av området till ett självständigt kungadöme, vilket under den närmaste
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>följande tiden fick flera efterföljare. Med tiden kom de att närma sig varandra, för att sedan,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under kung Tigran den store (95 – 56 f Kr) bli enade till en nation. Det var också under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>honom som det historiska Armenien nådde sin geografiskt sett största utbredning, omfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bland annat delar av Mesopotamien, Syrien, Cilicien och ända ner mot Palestina. Visserligen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hann riket även minska en del under kung Tigrans styre, då romarna erövrade delar av landet,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>men detta talas det inte mycket om, utan det är enandet av landet som är det viktiga.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under åren 287 – 294 och 297 – 330 e Kr styrdes Armenien av kung Tirdat III. Det var
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under dennes tid som St Grigor (Gregorius), upplysaren, enligt traditionen kom till landet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ska ha omvänt kungen (och därmed hela folket) till kristendomen. Detta ska ha skett år 301
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och med stöd av detta hävdar armenierna att de utgör den äldsta kristna staten i världen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenierna det äldsta kristna folket.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Från år 430 och under ett par århundraden framöver var Armenien delat mellan Bysans i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>väst och perserna i öst. De senare inledde förföljelser mot folket för att få dem att övergå till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den persiska zoroastrismen. En nationell, armenisk armé samlades dock under general Vardan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mamikonians ledning för att kämpa mot perserna. År 451 stod ett avgörande slag vid Avrayr,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>där visserligen armenierna förlorade mot den överlägsna persiska krigsmaskinen och där
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>general Vardan dog, men armenierna garanterades rätten att förbli kristna under persisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>överhöghet. Vardan är en förebild för folkets kamp mot olika förtryckare och kampen för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>rätten att vara kristna.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ett lidande folk</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Förutom de dryga sex seklerna kring Kristi födelse har armenierna nästan alltid varit styrda av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(och ofta uppdelade mellan) andra riken. Den längsta perioden av främmande styre och även
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den som kanske har satt mest spår i dagens armeniska identitet var den turkiska/ottomanska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tiden. Redan under 1000-talets andra hälft trängde turkarna in i området och tog makten för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett par hundra år. Efter ett antal andra härskare från olika håll kom sedan Armenien åter under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>turkiskt styre på 1500-talet, något som skulle sätta ett outplånligt spår i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>historien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Genom historien har återkommande upprorsförsök mot olika ockupationsmakter så gott
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som alltid brutalt slagits ned. Detta har givit den armeniska identiteten en ständig närvaro av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det historiska lidande som folket gått igenom under århundradenas lopp. Det finns dock ett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>särskilt tillfälle som varit upphov till värre lidande än någonsin tidigare. Under 1880-talet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hade en nationell armenisk rörelse uppstått, något som inte sågs med blida ögon av de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>styrande turkarna. Svåra förföljelser kom till följd av detta, vilka kulminerade i deportation
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och systematisk utrotning av omkring 1,5 miljoner människor under och strax efter första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>världskriget. Denna ofattbara tragedi lever kvar i näst intill varje armenier idag, och går ofta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under namnet ”massakern”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Att detta ”historiens första folkmord” idag kan vara så okänt är skrämmande. Relativt sett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>var massmorden på armenier större än nazisternas utrotningsförsök av judar. De 1,5 miljoner
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som avrättades utgjorde en större del av folket än de ca 6 miljoner judar som fick sätta livet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>till under andra världskriget.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkan ger identitet</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Då armenierna saknat kungar och andra oberoende styren under större delen av historien har
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ledarskapet för nationen, och därmed också centralpunkten för identifikationen, tagits över av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska apostoliska kyrkan. De mest begåvade intellektuella har ofta blivit präster och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under lång tid var den armeniska utbildningen underställd kyrkan. Tillsammans med den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gemensamma historien av lidande och det egna språket utgör den kristna tron grundpelarna i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska kyrkan präglas av två starka särdrag. Det första är kyrkans strukturella
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>demokratiska uppbyggnad. Liksom flera andra kyrkor är den armeniska kyrkan idag uppdelad
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>i (fyra) patriarkat, i vilka patriarkerna (katolikoserna) har en stark ställning som talesmän för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska befolkningen i respektive område. Det råder dock inga motsättningar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>patriarkerna emellan, utan snarare tvärtom. I ett tal uttryckte en av dem sig på följande sätt:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”Vi är en kyrka. Vi har varit en kyrka genom århundraden. Vi ska fortsätta att vara en kyrka i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kommande århundrade.” Den, med historiska mått mätt, demokratiska och allomfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan har säkerligen många gånger motverkat splittring hos folket. Det andra karaktärsdraget
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är den på vissa punkter näst intill unika kristna läran. Framför allt är det den monofysitiska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ståndpunkten som utmärker sig, vilken utvecklas senare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det är också i ljuset av den armeniska kyrkans starka position som man bör se traditionen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>att söka rötterna tillbaka till Noas son Jafet och därmed (med hjälp av religionen) rättfärdiga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sin närvaro i det historiska Armenien. Kanske har kyrkans roll ändå varit än starkare utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska territoriet. De många armenier som genom historiens lopp levt utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hemlandet har ändå bibehållit en utpräglad känsla av etnisk egenart, generation efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>generation. Man har exempelvis betecknat kyrkan som ”det frånvarande fosterlandets synbara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>själ”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkans lära och tradition</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Trots att vissa traditioner har levt kvar sedan tiden innan kristendomens ankomst och mer
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>eller mindre har blivit accepterade av kyrkan är den armeniska läran grundad på Bibeln och de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre första allmänna (ekumeniska) kyrkomötena.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Två särarter i den armenisk-kristna traditionen är dels det s k djuroffret, matal, och dels det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>symboliska livsträdet. Djuroffret härstammar från förkristen tid, men tillämpas fortfarande på
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vissa platser. Dock ses det idag snarare som en sedvänja än en religiös handling och det finns
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>en tendens från kyrkans håll att förtiga matal-ceremonin, men man kan inte bortse ifrån att
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan på ett tidigt stadium godkände offrandet och även reglerade det i sina religiösa lagar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Livsträdet å sin sida, är ett bra exempel på den religiösa och kulturella kontinuitet som präglar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska området. Från den tidiga Urartu-kulturens många bilder av livsträdet, via
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenisk ”trädkult”, till dyrkan av Kristi kors som livsträdet har den förkristna symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”slussats in” i den kristna läran.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vid det första kyrkomötet i Nicaea år 325 representerades armenierna av Grigor,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>upplysaren, och de centrala punkterna var beslutet att Fadern, Sonen och den Helige Anden är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre personer som tillsammans bildar en gudom. Detta är en av grundpelarna i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>läran, liksom den trosbekännelse som formulerades vid mötet och som sjungs i varje armenisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mässa.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkomötet i Efesus år 431, det tredje i ordningen, konstaterade att Kristus inte bara var en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människa som utgjorde Guds tempel, utan att Kristus är Guds son och att därmed Maria inte
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bara är Kristi moder utan också Guds moder. Detta är en ståndpunkt som även den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan fasthåller, liksom majoriteten av mötets deltagare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det fjärde kyrkomötet, som hölls år 451 i Kalcedon, saknade armenisk närvaro, då de låg i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>strid med perserna vid Avarayr. När de senare fick del av mötets beslut förkastade de detta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Man kunde dels inte godta den romerske påven Leos ståndpunkt att påven av Rom skulle vara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkans överhuvud. Mötet proklamerade också tron på Kristi dubbla natur, den mänskliga och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den gudomliga. Den armeniska kyrkan hävdar istället ”tron på en enda förenad natur hos
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds enfödde son”. Detta kom att kallas den monofysitiska läran, och lever idag kvar även i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>exempelvis den koptiska och den etiopiska kyrkan.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armeniska kyrkans sakrament</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I den armeniska kyrkan räknar man till sju sakrament av vilka tre (dopet, konfirmationen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ordinationen) endast kan tas emot en gång. De sju sakramenten är:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dopet – det grundläggande sakramentet. Genom dopet förenas man med Kristi kropp och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inlemmas i Kristi kyrka. Man får syndernas förlåtelse och blir värdig att ta emot de övriga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Myron-smörjelsen/konfirmationen – följer omedelbart efter dopet. Sätter den döpta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människan i stånd att möta världens prövningar och frestelser. Nu mottager hon den helig
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anden, vilket gör henne redo att bekänna den kristna tron.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden – en mötesplats för de kristna, ett enhetens sakrament. Den plats där Kristus föder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>lemmarna i sin kropp och förenar dem med sig själv. De yttre, synliga tecknen är (det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>osyrade) brödet och vinet, som mottas av de kristna efter att ha helgats av prästen. Brödet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vinet förvandlas visserligen inte fysiskt till kött och blod, och Kristus är inte fysiskt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>närvarande, men han är det andligt.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden är en andlig reningsprocess och endast den som tror och som ångrar sina synder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kan ta del av nattvarden, annars kan man inte få del av välsignelsen. Följden blir andlig skada
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och fördömelse, men för den som bekänner sina synder blir nattvarden en överlåtelsehandling.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den som vill deltaga i den heliga måltiden måste alltså först bikta sig, ta emot absolution
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(förlåtelse) och visa att man vill göra bättring. Man måste också fasta från midnatt innan man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>går till nattvarden, den ska nämligen vara det första man tar i munnen den dagen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Bikten och botgöringen – till för dem som behöver förlåtelse för de synder de begått efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dopet. Sakramentet består av tre delar; botfärdigheten, bikten inför prästen, som uttalar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>absolutionen, samt avlösningen. Absolutionen kan endast uttalas av en präst eller någon annan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>högre kyrklig ämbetsman, vilka fått myndigheten att göra detta genom den apostoliska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>successionen. Prästen handlar här som Guds tjänare, inte som egen person. Det är endast de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som verkligen ångrar sig som kan få absolution.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ordinationen – avskiljer en medlem av Kristi kropp till en särskild tjänst inom kyrkan. Den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armeniska kyrkan har åtta olika ordinationer, fyra lägre och fyra högre. De lägre är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dörrvaktare, föreläsare, edsvärare och lampbärare. De högre är diakon, präst, biskop, samt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>katolikos.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Äktenskapet – en varaktig förening mellan man och kvinna, liksom föreningen mellan Kristus
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och kyrkan är varaktig. Äktenskapet är en förbindelse instiftad av Gud och räknas därför till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten. Idealet är egentligen kyskhet, men ”om de inte kan behärska sig bör de gifta sig;
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det är bättre att gifta sig än att brinna av åtrå” (1 Kor 7:9). Målet för äktenskapet är att skaffa
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>barn, som ska bli nya medlemmar i kyrkan. Till skillnad från de andra sakramenten finns inga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>yttre ceremonier för äktenskapet, då det innehåller sådant som inte helt ryms inom en religiös
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ram. Äktenskapets yttre sida består snarare i att man börjar leva på ett nytt sätt, än att man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>genomgår en högtidlig ceremoni. I teorin kan äktenskapet endast upplösas genom döden och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett nytt äktenskap med en skild person medan den förre maken ännu är i livet är ett brott mot
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds lag.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sjuksmörjelsen – det sjunde sakramentet, vilket handlar om en förberedelse inför döden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den gudomliga liturgin</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armenisk liturgi är fylld av vördnad för det heliga. Alla böner och ceremonier bär något av en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”klassisk skönhet” i sina utformningar. Liturgin fyller församlingen med glädje och triumf
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och allt är i botten ett uttryck för det hemlighetsfulla skeende då Gud blev till människa.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska liturgin kan delas in i tre delar; den första delen är en</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>förberedelsegudstjänst, där prästen klär sig i mässkruden och förbereder nattvarden. Del två
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är katekumenernas gudstjänst (katekumener var människor som ännu inte döpts in i den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>fornkristna församlingen och därför inte fick ta nattvarden). Den tredje delen är de troendes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gudstjänst, där nattvarden utdelas.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Liksom så mycket annat när det gäller armenierna har liturgin rötter långt tillbaka i tiden, i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den urkristna gudstjänsten. Redan på 100-talet började man fira gudstjänst efter bestämda
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>former och på 300-talet hade liturgier utformats i grekiska, koptiska syrianska och armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkor.</p>

2 CONT <p>Khosrov III the Small (Armenian: Խոսրով Գ Կոտակ, Khosrov III Kotak; r. 330–339 A.D.) was the Arshakuni king Armenia. He was the son and successor of King Tiridates III and a member of

2 CONT <p>På detta sätt kunde sassaniderna nu koncentrera all sin styrka mot Armenien och kunde till slut, efter att på ett förrädiskt sätt ha mördat den armeniske konungen Khosrov I, erövra landet.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Khosrovs efterträdare, hans son Tirdat var fortfarande ett barn. Adeln och kungens närmaste lyckades rädda barnet som betraktades som Armeniens enda framtidshopp och smugglade honom till Rom. Me
2 CONC dan Armenien under 30 års tid led svårt av de persiska truppernas plundringar och trakasseringar, växte Tirdat upp i Rom och utbildades till en ung man som var bekant med flera västerländska spr�
2 CONC �k och litteratur. Han hade blivit en prins med stor passion för sitt fadersland och väl medveten om sina plikter som dess härskare.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gibbon skriver: "Tirdat III som hade räddats tack vare armeniernas lojalitet levde och utbildades i Rom under kejsarens beskydd. Hans distans till hemlandet och livet i ett främmande land gav hon
2 CONC om erfarenheter och personliga drag som han med stor säkerhet skulle ha gått miste om, utifall att han från början satt på tronen. Bland dessa egenskaper kan man nämna bl.a. tron på ödets nyck
2 CONC fullhet och människans illojalitet och romersk disciplin och ordning. Från sin tidiga ungdom visade han stort mod och värdighet och visade stor kunnighet i hanteringen av vapen. Förutom dessa egen
2 CONC skaper hade han en enorm styrka och imponerade på alla under tävlingar." 9
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under denna tid försökte den romerske kejsaren, Valerianus, att ta initiativet till en ny attack men led ett stort nederlag i slaget vid Edessa (Ourfa ) och togs till fånga av sassaniderna och d
2 CONC og under fångenskapen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Efter denna seger erövrade perserna Syrien, Kilikien och Kapadokien. Men just då det verkade som om det romerska imperiet höll på att falla sönder på grund av interna konflikter och oro, ägd
2 CONC e det storartade och mirakelliknande slaget vid Palmyra rum. Detta lilla land som bestod av en stad med samma namn, mitt i Syriens öken, med sin konung Odaenathos i spetsen, tvingades till ett ojämn
2 CONC t krig mot dåtidens stormakt Persien. Odaenathos lyckades steg för steg ta tillbaka Syrien, Kilikien, Kapadokien och en del av Mesopotamien. Rom och dess imperium i öst kunde på detta sätt rädda
2 CONC s tack vare Odaenathos och han utsågs till Roms ambassadör i öst.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Endast när kejsar Aurelius satt på tronen år 270 e. Kr. dök romarna upp igen i öst. Aurelius kom till Mindre Asien med sin omorganiserade armé. Först krossade han Palmyras kung vars maktlyst
2 CONC nad hade nått oerhörda proportioner och tog tillbaka Kapadokien, Kilikien och Syrien från honom. Staden Palmyra erövrades år 272 och drottning Zénobia (Odaenathos fru) togs till fånga och skick
2 CONC ades till Rom. Året därpå försökte Palmyra slå tillbaka mot romarna, men upproret misslyckades och romarna återerövrade staden och slog den i ruiner. Kejsar Aurelius fortsatte sitt krig mot pe
2 CONC rserna och lyckades tvinga sassaniderna att evakuera sina trupper från Mesopotamien.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tirdat III utnyttjade romarnas lyckade motattack och återvände till Armeniens gränser. Han lyckades få folk med sig i ett uppror och körde ut perserna från landet (287). Han hade tidigare vis
2 CONC at bevis på sin styrka och sitt mod. Vid ett tillfälle hade han räddat livet på den romerska fältherren Liscinus som några legionärer ville mörda genom att med utdraget svärd stå vid entrén
2 CONC  till fältherrens tält och inte låta legionärerna gå in. Vid ett annat tillfälle, under ett slag, gick han i full mundering med spjut och sköld i handen ner i floden Eufrat och simmade över de

2 CONT <p>Tiridates III was a king of Armenia (286-330), and is also known as Tiridates the Great. (Some scholars incorrectly refer to him as Tiridates IV as a result of the fact that Tiridates I of Armenia 
2 CONC reigned twice.) In 301, Tiridates proclaimed Christianity as the sole religion in Armenia, making that country the first Christian state in the world.

2 CONT <p> Early Childhood</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tiridates III was the son of Chosroes I of Armenia , the latter being assassinated in 287 by a Parthian agent named Anak under orders from Ardashir I. Anak was captured and executed along with most
2 CONC  of his family, while two of his sons one of whom was Saint Gregory the Illuminator were sheltered in Ceasaria. Being the only surviving heir to the throne, Tiridates was quickly taken away to Rome so
2 CONC on after his father’s assassination, while still an infant. He was educated in Rome and was well learned in languages and military tactics; in addition, he firmly understood and appreciated Roman la
2 CONC w.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kingship</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 270 AD the Roman emperor Aurelian reengaged the Sassanids on the eastern front and he was able to drive them back. Tiridates, as the true heir to the Parthian-occupied Armenian throne, came to A
2 CONC rmenia and quickly raised an army and drove the enemy out in 287 AD. The Roman-Armenian relationship grew stronger, especially while Diocletian ruled the empire. This can be attributed to the upbringi
2 CONC ng of Tiridates III, to the consistent Parthian aggressions and to the murder of his father by Anak. Diocletian left the Armenian state in a quasi-independent and protectorate status possibly to use i
2 CONC t as a buffer in case of a Parthian attack.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Conversion and Rest of Reign</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The story of the conversion of the king and the nation is historically true, but the actual details could possibly be rooted in legend. Gregory the Illuminator, the son of Anak, was a Christian con
2 CONC vert who, feeling guilt for the father’s sin, joined the Armenian army and worked as a secretary. Christianity in Armenia had a strong footing by the end of the 3rd century AD but the nation by and 
2 CONC large still followed Armenian pagan beliefs. Tiridates III was no exception as he too worshipped various gods. During a pagan religious ceremony Tiridates III ordered Gregory to place a flower reef at
2 CONC  the foot of the statue of the goddess Anahit in Eriza. Gregory refused, proclaiming his Christian faith. This act infuriated the king. His fury was only exacerbated when several individuals declared 
2 CONC that Gregory was the son of Anak; the traitor who had killed Tiridates’s father. Gregory was tortured and finally thrown in Khor Virap, a deep underground dungeon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the years of Gregory’s imprisonment, a group of virgins, lead by Gayane, came to Armenia as they fled the Roman persecution of their Christian faith. Tiridates III heard about the group an
2 CONC d the legendary beauty of one of its members, Hripsime. He brought them to the palace and demanded to marry the beautiful virgin; she refused. The king had the whole group tortured and killed. After t
2 CONC his event, he fell ill and according to legend, he adopted a pig-like behavior and was aimlessly wandering around in the forest. The king’s sister, Xosroviduxt, had a dream wherein Gregory was still
2 CONC  alive in the dungeon and he was the only one able to cure the king. At this point it had been 13 years since his imprisonment, and the odds of him being alive were slim. But they retrieved him and de
2 CONC spite being incredibly malnourished he was still alive. He was kept alive by a kindhearted woman that threw a loaf of bread down in Khor Virap everyday for him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tiridates III was brought to Gregory, and was miraculously cured of his illness in 301 AD. Tiridates III immediately proclaimed Christianity the official state religion. And so, Armenia became the 
2 CONC first nation to officially adopt Christianity. Tiridates III appointed Gregory as the first Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church. From 301 to 428 the Episcopal office was hereditary.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The switch from the traditional pagan Armenian religion to Christianity was not an easy one. Tiridates III often used force to impose this new faith upon the people and many battles ensued, because
2 CONC  polytheism was deeply rooted in the Armenian people. An actual battle between the king's forces and the polytheists took place, which resulted in their subjugation. Tiridates thus spent the rest of h
2 CONC is life trying to eliminate all old beliefs and in doing so destroyed countless statues, temples and texts. As a result, Armenians don't know much about their ancient history and culture. He worked fe
2 CONC verously to spread the faith and died in 330 AD.

2 CONT <p>Kristendomen kom till Armenien med apostlarna Taddaios och Bartolomaios men det var först 301 e Kr
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som Armeniens kung Tirdat III omvändes till Kristendomen av Gregorius Ljusbringaren. År 301 är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det officiella datumet då Armenien antog Kristendomen som statsreligion, som idag är världens äldsta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kristna nation.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armeniska Apostoliska kyrkan grundades år 301 e Kr av Grigor Ljusbringaren, tillsammans med kung Tirdat

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det historiska Armenien</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det ursprungliga Armenien upptog, ett flertal sekel f Kr, ett stort område öster om Mindre
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Asien och söder om Kaukasus. Svarta havet och Kaspiska havet ligger i nordväst, respektive
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nordost. Söderut låg parternas och persernas mäktiga riken. Den kanske mest kända symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>för Armenien är berget Ararat, där Noaks ark ska ha strandat efter sin långa resa. (Idag ligger
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>visserligen berget strax innanför den turkiska gränsen, men det är fullt synligt från många
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>delar av landet.)</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Namnet Ararat är nära besläktat med Urartu, assyriernas namn på det kungarike som en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gång låg på samma plats som det historiska Armenien. Detta rike nådde sin höjdpunkt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>omkring 800-talet till 500-talet f Kr och var då en stark konkurrent till det mäktiga Assyrien,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>om makten i området. En annan historiskt och symboliskt viktig plats är Araxesdalen, som är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mycket bördig och som av vissa påstås vara det ursprungliga Edens lustgård.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>När Urartu-riket gick under ca 590 f Kr kom olika stammar invandrande till området.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tillsammans kallade de sig för Hayastan, vilket fortfarande är det armeniska språkets
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>benämning på Armenien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tre hjältar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska historien skulle kunna skrivas mycket lång och händelserik, men de första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>femhundra åren e Kr skulle kunna sammanfattas runt tre historiska hjältar, vilka alla har sin
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>plats i den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>189 f Kr utgjorde delar av Armenien en provins inom det seleukidiska riket, men detta år
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inleddes även något som skulle bli den armeniska storhetstiden. Arthases (Artaxias) utropade
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nämligen en del av området till ett självständigt kungadöme, vilket under den närmaste
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>följande tiden fick flera efterföljare. Med tiden kom de att närma sig varandra, för att sedan,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under kung Tigran den store (95 – 56 f Kr) bli enade till en nation. Det var också under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>honom som det historiska Armenien nådde sin geografiskt sett största utbredning, omfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bland annat delar av Mesopotamien, Syrien, Cilicien och ända ner mot Palestina. Visserligen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hann riket även minska en del under kung Tigrans styre, då romarna erövrade delar av landet,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>men detta talas det inte mycket om, utan det är enandet av landet som är det viktiga.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under åren 287 – 294 och 297 – 330 e Kr styrdes Armenien av kung Tirdat III. Det var
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under dennes tid som St Grigor (Gregorius), upplysaren, enligt traditionen kom till landet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ska ha omvänt kungen (och därmed hela folket) till kristendomen. Detta ska ha skett år 301
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och med stöd av detta hävdar armenierna att de utgör den äldsta kristna staten i världen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenierna det äldsta kristna folket.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Från år 430 och under ett par århundraden framöver var Armenien delat mellan Bysans i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>väst och perserna i öst. De senare inledde förföljelser mot folket för att få dem att övergå till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den persiska zoroastrismen. En nationell, armenisk armé samlades dock under general Vardan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mamikonians ledning för att kämpa mot perserna. År 451 stod ett avgörande slag vid Avrayr,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>där visserligen armenierna förlorade mot den överlägsna persiska krigsmaskinen och där
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>general Vardan dog, men armenierna garanterades rätten att förbli kristna under persisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>överhöghet. Vardan är en förebild för folkets kamp mot olika förtryckare och kampen för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>rätten att vara kristna.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ett lidande folk</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Förutom de dryga sex seklerna kring Kristi födelse har armenierna nästan alltid varit styrda av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(och ofta uppdelade mellan) andra riken. Den längsta perioden av främmande styre och även
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den som kanske har satt mest spår i dagens armeniska identitet var den turkiska/ottomanska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tiden. Redan under 1000-talets andra hälft trängde turkarna in i området och tog makten för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett par hundra år. Efter ett antal andra härskare från olika håll kom sedan Armenien åter under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>turkiskt styre på 1500-talet, något som skulle sätta ett outplånligt spår i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>historien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Genom historien har återkommande upprorsförsök mot olika ockupationsmakter så gott
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som alltid brutalt slagits ned. Detta har givit den armeniska identiteten en ständig närvaro av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det historiska lidande som folket gått igenom under århundradenas lopp. Det finns dock ett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>särskilt tillfälle som varit upphov till värre lidande än någonsin tidigare. Under 1880-talet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hade en nationell armenisk rörelse uppstått, något som inte sågs med blida ögon av de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>styrande turkarna. Svåra förföljelser kom till följd av detta, vilka kulminerade i deportation
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och systematisk utrotning av omkring 1,5 miljoner människor under och strax efter första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>världskriget. Denna ofattbara tragedi lever kvar i näst intill varje armenier idag, och går ofta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under namnet ”massakern”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Att detta ”historiens första folkmord” idag kan vara så okänt är skrämmande. Relativt sett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>var massmorden på armenier större än nazisternas utrotningsförsök av judar. De 1,5 miljoner
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som avrättades utgjorde en större del av folket än de ca 6 miljoner judar som fick sätta livet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>till under andra världskriget.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkan ger identitet</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Då armenierna saknat kungar och andra oberoende styren under större delen av historien har
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ledarskapet för nationen, och därmed också centralpunkten för identifikationen, tagits över av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska apostoliska kyrkan. De mest begåvade intellektuella har ofta blivit präster och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under lång tid var den armeniska utbildningen underställd kyrkan. Tillsammans med den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gemensamma historien av lidande och det egna språket utgör den kristna tron grundpelarna i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska kyrkan präglas av två starka särdrag. Det första är kyrkans strukturella
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>demokratiska uppbyggnad. Liksom flera andra kyrkor är den armeniska kyrkan idag uppdelad
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>i (fyra) patriarkat, i vilka patriarkerna (katolikoserna) har en stark ställning som talesmän för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska befolkningen i respektive område. Det råder dock inga motsättningar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>patriarkerna emellan, utan snarare tvärtom. I ett tal uttryckte en av dem sig på följande sätt:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”Vi är en kyrka. Vi har varit en kyrka genom århundraden. Vi ska fortsätta att vara en kyrka i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kommande århundrade.” Den, med historiska mått mätt, demokratiska och allomfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan har säkerligen många gånger motverkat splittring hos folket. Det andra karaktärsdraget
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är den på vissa punkter näst intill unika kristna läran. Framför allt är det den monofysitiska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ståndpunkten som utmärker sig, vilken utvecklas senare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det är också i ljuset av den armeniska kyrkans starka position som man bör se traditionen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>att söka rötterna tillbaka till Noas son Jafet och därmed (med hjälp av religionen) rättfärdiga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sin närvaro i det historiska Armenien. Kanske har kyrkans roll ändå varit än starkare utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska territoriet. De många armenier som genom historiens lopp levt utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hemlandet har ändå bibehållit en utpräglad känsla av etnisk egenart, generation efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>generation. Man har exempelvis betecknat kyrkan som ”det frånvarande fosterlandets synbara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>själ”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkans lära och tradition</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Trots att vissa traditioner har levt kvar sedan tiden innan kristendomens ankomst och mer
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>eller mindre har blivit accepterade av kyrkan är den armeniska läran grundad på Bibeln och de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre första allmänna (ekumeniska) kyrkomötena.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Två särarter i den armenisk-kristna traditionen är dels det s k djuroffret, matal, och dels det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>symboliska livsträdet. Djuroffret härstammar från förkristen tid, men tillämpas fortfarande på
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vissa platser. Dock ses det idag snarare som en sedvänja än en religiös handling och det finns
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>en tendens från kyrkans håll att förtiga matal-ceremonin, men man kan inte bortse ifrån att
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan på ett tidigt stadium godkände offrandet och även reglerade det i sina religiösa lagar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Livsträdet å sin sida, är ett bra exempel på den religiösa och kulturella kontinuitet som präglar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska området. Från den tidiga Urartu-kulturens många bilder av livsträdet, via
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenisk ”trädkult”, till dyrkan av Kristi kors som livsträdet har den förkristna symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”slussats in” i den kristna läran.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vid det första kyrkomötet i Nicaea år 325 representerades armenierna av Grigor,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>upplysaren, och de centrala punkterna var beslutet att Fadern, Sonen och den Helige Anden är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre personer som tillsammans bildar en gudom. Detta är en av grundpelarna i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>läran, liksom den trosbekännelse som formulerades vid mötet och som sjungs i varje armenisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mässa.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkomötet i Efesus år 431, det tredje i ordningen, konstaterade att Kristus inte bara var en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människa som utgjorde Guds tempel, utan att Kristus är Guds son och att därmed Maria inte
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bara är Kristi moder utan också Guds moder. Detta är en ståndpunkt som även den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan fasthåller, liksom majoriteten av mötets deltagare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det fjärde kyrkomötet, som hölls år 451 i Kalcedon, saknade armenisk närvaro, då de låg i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>strid med perserna vid Avarayr. När de senare fick del av mötets beslut förkastade de detta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Man kunde dels inte godta den romerske påven Leos ståndpunkt att påven av Rom skulle vara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkans överhuvud. Mötet proklamerade också tron på Kristi dubbla natur, den mänskliga och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den gudomliga. Den armeniska kyrkan hävdar istället ”tron på en enda förenad natur hos
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds enfödde son”. Detta kom att kallas den monofysitiska läran, och lever idag kvar även i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>exempelvis den koptiska och den etiopiska kyrkan.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armeniska kyrkans sakrament</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I den armeniska kyrkan räknar man till sju sakrament av vilka tre (dopet, konfirmationen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ordinationen) endast kan tas emot en gång. De sju sakramenten är:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dopet – det grundläggande sakramentet. Genom dopet förenas man med Kristi kropp och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inlemmas i Kristi kyrka. Man får syndernas förlåtelse och blir värdig att ta emot de övriga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Myron-smörjelsen/konfirmationen – följer omedelbart efter dopet. Sätter den döpta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människan i stånd att möta världens prövningar och frestelser. Nu mottager hon den helig
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anden, vilket gör henne redo att bekänna den kristna tron.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden – en mötesplats för de kristna, ett enhetens sakrament. Den plats där Kristus föder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>lemmarna i sin kropp och förenar dem med sig själv. De yttre, synliga tecknen är (det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>osyrade) brödet och vinet, som mottas av de kristna efter att ha helgats av prästen. Brödet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vinet förvandlas visserligen inte fysiskt till kött och blod, och Kristus är inte fysiskt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>närvarande, men han är det andligt.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden är en andlig reningsprocess och endast den som tror och som ångrar sina synder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kan ta del av nattvarden, annars kan man inte få del av välsignelsen. Följden blir andlig skada
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och fördömelse, men för den som bekänner sina synder blir nattvarden en överlåtelsehandling.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den som vill deltaga i den heliga måltiden måste alltså först bikta sig, ta emot absolution
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(förlåtelse) och visa att man vill göra bättring. Man måste också fasta från midnatt innan man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>går till nattvarden, den ska nämligen vara det första man tar i munnen den dagen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Bikten och botgöringen – till för dem som behöver förlåtelse för de synder de begått efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dopet. Sakramentet består av tre delar; botfärdigheten, bikten inför prästen, som uttalar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>absolutionen, samt avlösningen. Absolutionen kan endast uttalas av en präst eller någon annan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>högre kyrklig ämbetsman, vilka fått myndigheten att göra detta genom den apostoliska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>successionen. Prästen handlar här som Guds tjänare, inte som egen person. Det är endast de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som verkligen ångrar sig som kan få absolution.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ordinationen – avskiljer en medlem av Kristi kropp till en särskild tjänst inom kyrkan. Den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armeniska kyrkan har åtta olika ordinationer, fyra lägre och fyra högre. De lägre är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dörrvaktare, föreläsare, edsvärare och lampbärare. De högre är diakon, präst, biskop, samt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>katolikos.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Äktenskapet – en varaktig förening mellan man och kvinna, liksom föreningen mellan Kristus
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och kyrkan är varaktig. Äktenskapet är en förbindelse instiftad av Gud och räknas därför till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten. Idealet är egentligen kyskhet, men ”om de inte kan behärska sig bör de gifta sig;
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det är bättre att gifta sig än att brinna av åtrå” (1 Kor 7:9). Målet för äktenskapet är att skaffa
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>barn, som ska bli nya medlemmar i kyrkan. Till skillnad från de andra sakramenten finns inga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>yttre ceremonier för äktenskapet, då det innehåller sådant som inte helt ryms inom en religiös
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ram. Äktenskapets yttre sida består snarare i att man börjar leva på ett nytt sätt, än att man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>genomgår en högtidlig ceremoni. I teorin kan äktenskapet endast upplösas genom döden och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett nytt äktenskap med en skild person medan den förre maken ännu är i livet är ett brott mot
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds lag.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sjuksmörjelsen – det sjunde sakramentet, vilket handlar om en förberedelse inför döden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den gudomliga liturgin</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armenisk liturgi är fylld av vördnad för det heliga. Alla böner och ceremonier bär något av en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”klassisk skönhet” i sina utformningar. Liturgin fyller församlingen med glädje och triumf
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och allt är i botten ett uttryck för det hemlighetsfulla skeende då Gud blev till människa.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska liturgin kan delas in i tre delar; den första delen är en</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>förberedelsegudstjänst, där prästen klär sig i mässkruden och förbereder nattvarden. Del två
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är katekumenernas gudstjänst (katekumener var människor som ännu inte döpts in i den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>fornkristna församlingen och därför inte fick ta nattvarden). Den tredje delen är de troendes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gudstjänst, där nattvarden utdelas.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Liksom så mycket annat när det gäller armenierna har liturgin rötter långt tillbaka i tiden, i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den urkristna gudstjänsten. Redan på 100-talet började man fira gudstjänst efter bestämda
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>former och på 300-talet hade liturgier utformats i grekiska, koptiska syrianska och armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkor.</p>

2 CONT <p>Tiridates III (or Trdat III; Armenian: Տրդատ Գ; 250 – c. 330) was the king of Iranian Arsacid Armenia (285-339), and is also known as Tiridates the Great Տրդատ Մեծ; some scholars in
2 CONC correctly refer to him as Tiridates IV as a result of the fact that Tiridates I of Armenia reigned twice). In 301, Tiridates proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of Armenia, making the Armeni
2 CONC an kingdom the first state to officially embrace Christianity.[1] He is recognized as a saint by the Armenian Apostolic Church.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tiridates III was the son of Khosrov II of Armenia, the latter being assassinated in 252 by a Parthian agent named Anak under orders from Ardashir I. Anak was captured and executed along with most 
2 CONC of his family, while two of his sons one of whom was Saint Gregory the Illuminator were sheltered in Caesaria. Being the only surviving heir to the throne, Tiridates was quickly taken away to Rome soo
2 CONC n after his father’s assassination, while still an infant. He was educated in Rome and was well skilled in languages and military tactics;[2][3] in addition, he firmly understood and appreciated Rom
2 CONC an law.

2 CONC  can be attributed to the upbringing of Tiridates, the consistent Persian aggressions, and the murder of his father by Anak. With Diocletian's help, Tiridates pushed the Persians out of Armenia.[2] In

2 CONT <p>The traditional story of the conversion of the king and the nation tells of how Gregory the Illuminator, the son of Anak, was a Christian convert who, feeling guilt for his own father’s sin, join

2 CONC Anahit in Eriza. Gregory refused, proclaiming his Christian faith. This act infuriated the king. His fury was only exacerbated when several individuals declared that Gregory was, in fact, the son of A

2 CONT <p>During the years of Gregory’s imprisonment, a group of virgin nuns, lead by Gayane, came to Armenia as they fled the Roman persecution of their Christian faith. Tiridates III heard about the grou

2 CONT <p>Tiridates was brought to Gregory, and was miraculously cured of his illness in 301 AD.[5] Persuaded by the power of the cure, the king immediately proclaimed Christianity the official state religio

2 CONT <p>"Armenia becomes the first Christian nation.   For all that, it's only two and half centuries later that Armenia was Christianized. In 301, the king Tiridates established Christianity as a sole rel
2 CONC igion of Armenia. Some modern researchers unsubstantially pretend the event took place in 314, and not in 301. The fact remains that the Edict of Milan decreed by Constantine the Great in 313 simply m
2 CONC andated tolerance of the Christians in the Roman Empire, while Tiridates the Great proclaimed Christianity as a sole religion throughout all Armenian lands. Thus, Armenia became the first Christian St
2 CONC ate in the history of the world.
2 CONT <p>Gregory the Illuminator, the first Patriarch of the Armenian Church, converted Tiridates and his court. Before his conversion Tiridates, famous for his tyranny, persecuted Christians. After many ho
2 CONC rrible tortures, he threw Gregory into an underground pit full of serpents and dead bodies, where Gregory spent 13 long years.
2 CONT <p>Agathangeghos, historian of 4th century, states that during Gregory's imprisonment a group of Christian virgins under the guidance of Gayane Abbess arrived in the city of Vagharshapat. The King Tir

2 CONT <p>regerade 280-287</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det historiska Armenien</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det ursprungliga Armenien upptog, ett flertal sekel f Kr, ett stort område öster om Mindre
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Asien och söder om Kaukasus. Svarta havet och Kaspiska havet ligger i nordväst, respektive
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nordost. Söderut låg parternas och persernas mäktiga riken. Den kanske mest kända symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>för Armenien är berget Ararat, där Noaks ark ska ha strandat efter sin långa resa. (Idag ligger
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>visserligen berget strax innanför den turkiska gränsen, men det är fullt synligt från många
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>delar av landet.)</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Namnet Ararat är nära besläktat med Urartu, assyriernas namn på det kungarike som en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gång låg på samma plats som det historiska Armenien. Detta rike nådde sin höjdpunkt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>omkring 800-talet till 500-talet f Kr och var då en stark konkurrent till det mäktiga Assyrien,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>om makten i området. En annan historiskt och symboliskt viktig plats är Araxesdalen, som är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mycket bördig och som av vissa påstås vara det ursprungliga Edens lustgård.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>När Urartu-riket gick under ca 590 f Kr kom olika stammar invandrande till området.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tillsammans kallade de sig för Hayastan, vilket fortfarande är det armeniska språkets
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>benämning på Armenien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tre hjältar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska historien skulle kunna skrivas mycket lång och händelserik, men de första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>femhundra åren e Kr skulle kunna sammanfattas runt tre historiska hjältar, vilka alla har sin
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>plats i den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>189 f Kr utgjorde delar av Armenien en provins inom det seleukidiska riket, men detta år
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inleddes även något som skulle bli den armeniska storhetstiden. Arthases (Artaxias) utropade
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nämligen en del av området till ett självständigt kungadöme, vilket under den närmaste
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>följande tiden fick flera efterföljare. Med tiden kom de att närma sig varandra, för att sedan,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under kung Tigran den store (95 – 56 f Kr) bli enade till en nation. Det var också under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>honom som det historiska Armenien nådde sin geografiskt sett största utbredning, omfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bland annat delar av Mesopotamien, Syrien, Cilicien och ända ner mot Palestina. Visserligen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hann riket även minska en del under kung Tigrans styre, då romarna erövrade delar av landet,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>men detta talas det inte mycket om, utan det är enandet av landet som är det viktiga.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under åren 287 – 294 och 297 – 330 e Kr styrdes Armenien av kung Tirdat III. Det var
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under dennes tid som St Grigor (Gregorius), upplysaren, enligt traditionen kom till landet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ska ha omvänt kungen (och därmed hela folket) till kristendomen. Detta ska ha skett år 301
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och med stöd av detta hävdar armenierna att de utgör den äldsta kristna staten i världen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenierna det äldsta kristna folket.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Från år 430 och under ett par århundraden framöver var Armenien delat mellan Bysans i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>väst och perserna i öst. De senare inledde förföljelser mot folket för att få dem att övergå till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den persiska zoroastrismen. En nationell, armenisk armé samlades dock under general Vardan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mamikonians ledning för att kämpa mot perserna. År 451 stod ett avgörande slag vid Avrayr,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>där visserligen armenierna förlorade mot den överlägsna persiska krigsmaskinen och där
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>general Vardan dog, men armenierna garanterades rätten att förbli kristna under persisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>överhöghet. Vardan är en förebild för folkets kamp mot olika förtryckare och kampen för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>rätten att vara kristna.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ett lidande folk</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Förutom de dryga sex seklerna kring Kristi födelse har armenierna nästan alltid varit styrda av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(och ofta uppdelade mellan) andra riken. Den längsta perioden av främmande styre och även
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den som kanske har satt mest spår i dagens armeniska identitet var den turkiska/ottomanska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tiden. Redan under 1000-talets andra hälft trängde turkarna in i området och tog makten för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett par hundra år. Efter ett antal andra härskare från olika håll kom sedan Armenien åter under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>turkiskt styre på 1500-talet, något som skulle sätta ett outplånligt spår i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>historien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Genom historien har återkommande upprorsförsök mot olika ockupationsmakter så gott
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som alltid brutalt slagits ned. Detta har givit den armeniska identiteten en ständig närvaro av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det historiska lidande som folket gått igenom under århundradenas lopp. Det finns dock ett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>särskilt tillfälle som varit upphov till värre lidande än någonsin tidigare. Under 1880-talet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hade en nationell armenisk rörelse uppstått, något som inte sågs med blida ögon av de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>styrande turkarna. Svåra förföljelser kom till följd av detta, vilka kulminerade i deportation
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och systematisk utrotning av omkring 1,5 miljoner människor under och strax efter första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>världskriget. Denna ofattbara tragedi lever kvar i näst intill varje armenier idag, och går ofta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under namnet ”massakern”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Att detta ”historiens första folkmord” idag kan vara så okänt är skrämmande. Relativt sett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>var massmorden på armenier större än nazisternas utrotningsförsök av judar. De 1,5 miljoner
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som avrättades utgjorde en större del av folket än de ca 6 miljoner judar som fick sätta livet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>till under andra världskriget.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkan ger identitet</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Då armenierna saknat kungar och andra oberoende styren under större delen av historien har
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ledarskapet för nationen, och därmed också centralpunkten för identifikationen, tagits över av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska apostoliska kyrkan. De mest begåvade intellektuella har ofta blivit präster och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under lång tid var den armeniska utbildningen underställd kyrkan. Tillsammans med den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gemensamma historien av lidande och det egna språket utgör den kristna tron grundpelarna i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska kyrkan präglas av två starka särdrag. Det första är kyrkans strukturella
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>demokratiska uppbyggnad. Liksom flera andra kyrkor är den armeniska kyrkan idag uppdelad
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>i (fyra) patriarkat, i vilka patriarkerna (katolikoserna) har en stark ställning som talesmän för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska befolkningen i respektive område. Det råder dock inga motsättningar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>patriarkerna emellan, utan snarare tvärtom. I ett tal uttryckte en av dem sig på följande sätt:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”Vi är en kyrka. Vi har varit en kyrka genom århundraden. Vi ska fortsätta att vara en kyrka i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kommande århundrade.” Den, med historiska mått mätt, demokratiska och allomfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan har säkerligen många gånger motverkat splittring hos folket. Det andra karaktärsdraget
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är den på vissa punkter näst intill unika kristna läran. Framför allt är det den monofysitiska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ståndpunkten som utmärker sig, vilken utvecklas senare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det är också i ljuset av den armeniska kyrkans starka position som man bör se traditionen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>att söka rötterna tillbaka till Noas son Jafet och därmed (med hjälp av religionen) rättfärdiga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sin närvaro i det historiska Armenien. Kanske har kyrkans roll ändå varit än starkare utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska territoriet. De många armenier som genom historiens lopp levt utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hemlandet har ändå bibehållit en utpräglad känsla av etnisk egenart, generation efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>generation. Man har exempelvis betecknat kyrkan som ”det frånvarande fosterlandets synbara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>själ”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkans lära och tradition</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Trots att vissa traditioner har levt kvar sedan tiden innan kristendomens ankomst och mer
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>eller mindre har blivit accepterade av kyrkan är den armeniska läran grundad på Bibeln och de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre första allmänna (ekumeniska) kyrkomötena.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Två särarter i den armenisk-kristna traditionen är dels det s k djuroffret, matal, och dels det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>symboliska livsträdet. Djuroffret härstammar från förkristen tid, men tillämpas fortfarande på
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vissa platser. Dock ses det idag snarare som en sedvänja än en religiös handling och det finns
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>en tendens från kyrkans håll att förtiga matal-ceremonin, men man kan inte bortse ifrån att
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan på ett tidigt stadium godkände offrandet och även reglerade det i sina religiösa lagar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Livsträdet å sin sida, är ett bra exempel på den religiösa och kulturella kontinuitet som präglar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska området. Från den tidiga Urartu-kulturens många bilder av livsträdet, via
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenisk ”trädkult”, till dyrkan av Kristi kors som livsträdet har den förkristna symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”slussats in” i den kristna läran.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vid det första kyrkomötet i Nicaea år 325 representerades armenierna av Grigor,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>upplysaren, och de centrala punkterna var beslutet att Fadern, Sonen och den Helige Anden är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre personer som tillsammans bildar en gudom. Detta är en av grundpelarna i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>läran, liksom den trosbekännelse som formulerades vid mötet och som sjungs i varje armenisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mässa.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkomötet i Efesus år 431, det tredje i ordningen, konstaterade att Kristus inte bara var en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människa som utgjorde Guds tempel, utan att Kristus är Guds son och att därmed Maria inte
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bara är Kristi moder utan också Guds moder. Detta är en ståndpunkt som även den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan fasthåller, liksom majoriteten av mötets deltagare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det fjärde kyrkomötet, som hölls år 451 i Kalcedon, saknade armenisk närvaro, då de låg i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>strid med perserna vid Avarayr. När de senare fick del av mötets beslut förkastade de detta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Man kunde dels inte godta den romerske påven Leos ståndpunkt att påven av Rom skulle vara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkans överhuvud. Mötet proklamerade också tron på Kristi dubbla natur, den mänskliga och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den gudomliga. Den armeniska kyrkan hävdar istället ”tron på en enda förenad natur hos
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds enfödde son”. Detta kom att kallas den monofysitiska läran, och lever idag kvar även i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>exempelvis den koptiska och den etiopiska kyrkan.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armeniska kyrkans sakrament</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I den armeniska kyrkan räknar man till sju sakrament av vilka tre (dopet, konfirmationen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ordinationen) endast kan tas emot en gång. De sju sakramenten är:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dopet – det grundläggande sakramentet. Genom dopet förenas man med Kristi kropp och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inlemmas i Kristi kyrka. Man får syndernas förlåtelse och blir värdig att ta emot de övriga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Myron-smörjelsen/konfirmationen – följer omedelbart efter dopet. Sätter den döpta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människan i stånd att möta världens prövningar och frestelser. Nu mottager hon den helig
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anden, vilket gör henne redo att bekänna den kristna tron.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden – en mötesplats för de kristna, ett enhetens sakrament. Den plats där Kristus föder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>lemmarna i sin kropp och förenar dem med sig själv. De yttre, synliga tecknen är (det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>osyrade) brödet och vinet, som mottas av de kristna efter att ha helgats av prästen. Brödet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vinet förvandlas visserligen inte fysiskt till kött och blod, och Kristus är inte fysiskt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>närvarande, men han är det andligt.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden är en andlig reningsprocess och endast den som tror och som ångrar sina synder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kan ta del av nattvarden, annars kan man inte få del av välsignelsen. Följden blir andlig skada
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och fördömelse, men för den som bekänner sina synder blir nattvarden en överlåtelsehandling.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den som vill deltaga i den heliga måltiden måste alltså först bikta sig, ta emot absolution
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(förlåtelse) och visa att man vill göra bättring. Man måste också fasta från midnatt innan man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>går till nattvarden, den ska nämligen vara det första man tar i munnen den dagen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Bikten och botgöringen – till för dem som behöver förlåtelse för de synder de begått efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dopet. Sakramentet består av tre delar; botfärdigheten, bikten inför prästen, som uttalar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>absolutionen, samt avlösningen. Absolutionen kan endast uttalas av en präst eller någon annan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>högre kyrklig ämbetsman, vilka fått myndigheten att göra detta genom den apostoliska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>successionen. Prästen handlar här som Guds tjänare, inte som egen person. Det är endast de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som verkligen ångrar sig som kan få absolution.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ordinationen – avskiljer en medlem av Kristi kropp till en särskild tjänst inom kyrkan. Den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armeniska kyrkan har åtta olika ordinationer, fyra lägre och fyra högre. De lägre är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dörrvaktare, föreläsare, edsvärare och lampbärare. De högre är diakon, präst, biskop, samt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>katolikos.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Äktenskapet – en varaktig förening mellan man och kvinna, liksom föreningen mellan Kristus
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och kyrkan är varaktig. Äktenskapet är en förbindelse instiftad av Gud och räknas därför till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten. Idealet är egentligen kyskhet, men ”om de inte kan behärska sig bör de gifta sig;
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det är bättre att gifta sig än att brinna av åtrå” (1 Kor 7:9). Målet för äktenskapet är att skaffa
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>barn, som ska bli nya medlemmar i kyrkan. Till skillnad från de andra sakramenten finns inga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>yttre ceremonier för äktenskapet, då det innehåller sådant som inte helt ryms inom en religiös
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ram. Äktenskapets yttre sida består snarare i att man börjar leva på ett nytt sätt, än att man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>genomgår en högtidlig ceremoni. I teorin kan äktenskapet endast upplösas genom döden och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett nytt äktenskap med en skild person medan den förre maken ännu är i livet är ett brott mot
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds lag.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sjuksmörjelsen – det sjunde sakramentet, vilket handlar om en förberedelse inför döden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den gudomliga liturgin</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armenisk liturgi är fylld av vördnad för det heliga. Alla böner och ceremonier bär något av en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”klassisk skönhet” i sina utformningar. Liturgin fyller församlingen med glädje och triumf
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och allt är i botten ett uttryck för det hemlighetsfulla skeende då Gud blev till människa.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska liturgin kan delas in i tre delar; den första delen är en</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>förberedelsegudstjänst, där prästen klär sig i mässkruden och förbereder nattvarden. Del två
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är katekumenernas gudstjänst (katekumener var människor som ännu inte döpts in i den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>fornkristna församlingen och därför inte fick ta nattvarden). Den tredje delen är de troendes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gudstjänst, där nattvarden utdelas.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Liksom så mycket annat när det gäller armenierna har liturgin rötter långt tillbaka i tiden, i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den urkristna gudstjänsten. Redan på 100-talet började man fira gudstjänst efter bestämda
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>former och på 300-talet hade liturgier utformats i grekiska, koptiska syrianska och armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkor.</p>

2 CONT <p>Gregory the Illuminator (from the Catholic Encyclopedia)</p>
2 CONT <p>Born 257?; died 337?, surnamed the Illuminator (Lusavorich).</p>
2 CONT <p>Gregory the Illuminator is the apostle, national saint, and patron of Armenia. He was not the first who introduced Christianity into that country. The Armenians maintain that the faith was preached
2 CONC  there by the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddaeus. Thaddaeus especially (the hero of the story of King Abgar of Edessa and the portrait of Christ) has been taken over by the Armenians, with the whole s
2 CONC tory. Abgar in their version becomes a King of Armenia; thus their land is the first of all to turn Christian. It is certain that there were Christians, even bishops, in Armenia before St. Gregory. Th
2 CONC e south Edessa and Nisibis especially, which accounts for the Armenian adoption of the Edessene story. A certain Dionysius of Alexandria (248-265) wrote them a letter "about penitence" (Euseb., "Hist.
2 CONC  Eccl.", VI, xlvi). This earliest Church was then destroyed by the Persians. Ardashir I, the founder of the Sassanid dynasty (226), restored, even extended, the old power of Persia. Armenia, always th
2 CONC e exposed frontier state between Rome and Persia, was overrun by Ardashir's army (Khosrov I of Armenia had taken the side of the old Arsacid dynasty); and the principle of uniformity in the Mazdean re
2 CONC ligion, that the Sassanids made a chief feature of their policy, was also applied to the subject kingdom. A Parthian named Anak murdered Khosrov by Ardashir's orders, who then tried to exterminate the
2 CONC  whole Armenian royal family. But a son of Khosrov, Trdat (Tiridates), escaped was trained in the Roman army, and eventually came back to drive out the persians and restore the Armenian kingdom.
2 CONT <p>In this restoration St. Gregory played an important part. He had been brought up as a Christian at Caesarea in Cappadocia. He seems to have belonged to an illustrious Armenian family. He was marrie
2 CONC d and had two sons (called Aristakes and Bardanes in the Greek text of Moses of Kkhorni; see below). Gregory, after being himself persecuted by King Trdat, who at first defended the old Armenian relig
2 CONC ion, eventually converted him, and with him spread the Christian faith throughout the country. Trdat became so much a Christian that he made Christianity the national faith; the nobility seem to have 
2 CONC followed his example easily, then the people followed -- or were induced to follow -- too. This happened while Diocletian was emperor (284-305), so that Armenia has a right to her claim of being the f
2 CONC irst Christian State. The temples were made into churches and the people baptized in thousands. So completely were the remains of the old heathendom effaced that we know practically nothing about the 
2 CONC original Armenian religion (as distinct from Mazdeism), except the names of some gods whose temples were destroyed or converted (the chief temple at Ashtishat was dedicated to Vahagn, Anahit and Astli
2 CONC k; Vanatur was worshipped in the North round Mount Ararat, etc.). Meanwhile Gregory had gone back to Caessarea to be ordained. Leontius of Caesarea made him bishop of the Armenians; from this time til
2 CONC l the Monophysite schism the Church of Armenia depended on Casearea, and the Armenian primates (called Catholicoi, only much later patriarchs) went there to be ordained. Gregory set up other bishops t
2 CONC hroughout the land and fixed his residence at Ashtishat (in the province of Taron), where the temple had been made into the church of Christ, "mother of all Armenian churches". He preached in the nati
2 CONC onal language and used it for the liturgy. This, too, helped to give the Armenian Church the markedly national character that it still has, more, perhaps, than any other in Christendom. Towards the en
2 CONC d of his life he retired and was succeeded as Catholicos by his son Aristakes. Aristakes was present at the First General Council, in 325. Gregory died and was buried at Thortan. A monastery was built
2 CONC  near his grave. His relics were afterwards taken to Constantinople, but apparently brough back again to Armenia. Part of these relics are said to have been taken to Naples during the Iconoclast troub
2 CONC les.
2 CONT <p>This is what can be said with some certainty about the Apostle of Armenia; but a famous life of him by Aganthangelos (see below) embellishes the narrative with wonderful stories that need not be ta
2 CONC ken very seriously. According to this life, he was the son of the Parthian Anak who had murdered King Khosrov I. Anak in trying to escape was drowned in the Araxes with all his family except two sons,
2 CONC  of whom one went to Persia, the other (the subject of this article) was taken by his Christian nurse to Caesarea and there baptized Gregory, in accordance with what she had been told in vision. Soon 
2 CONC after his marriage, Gregory parted from his wife (who became a nun) and came back to Armenia. Here he refused to take part in a great sacrifice to the national gods ordered by King Trdat, and declared
2 CONC  himself a Christian. He was then tortured in various horrible ways, all the more when the king discovered that he was the son of his father's murderer. After being subjected to a variety of tortures 
2 CONC (they scourged him, and put his head in a bag of ashes, poured molten lead over him, etc.) he was thrown into a pit full of dead bodies, poisonous filth, and serpents. He spent fifteen years in this p
2 CONC it, being fed by bread that a pious widow brought him daily. Meanwhile Trdat goes from bad to worse. A holy virgin named Rhipsime, who resists the king's advances and is martyred, here plays a great p
2 CONC art in the story. Evenetually, as a punishment for his wickedness, the king is turned into a boar and possessed by a devil. A vision now reveals to the monarch's sisters that nothing can save him but 
2 CONC the prayers of Gregory. At first no one will attend to this revelation, since they all think Gregory dead long ago. Eventually they seek and find him in the pit. He comes out, exorcizes the evil spiri
2 CONC t and restores the king, and then begins preaching. Here a long discourse is put into the saint's mouth -- so long that it takes up more than half his life. It is simply a compendium of what the Armen
2 CONC ian Church believed at the time that it was written (fifth century). It begins with an account of Bible history and goes on to dogmatic theology. Arianism, Nestorianism and all the other heresies up t
2 CONC o Monophysite times are refuted. The discourse bears the stamp of the latter half of the fifth century so plainly that, even without the fact that earlier writers who quote Agathangelos (Moses of Khor
2 CONC ni, etc.) do not know it, no one could doubt that it is the composition of an Armenian theologian of that time, inserted into the life that was already full enough of wonders. Nevertheles this "Confes
2 CONC sion of Gregory the Illuminator" was accepted as authentic and used as a kind of official creed by the Armenian Church during all the centuries that followed. Even now it is only the more liberal theo
2 CONC logians among them who dispute its genuiness.
2 CONT <p>The life goes on to tell us of Gregory's fast of seventy days that followed his rescue from the pit, of the conversion, and of their journeys throughout the land with the army to put down paganism.
2 CONC  The false gods fight against the army like men or devils, but are always defeated by Trdat's arms and Gregory's prayers and are eventually driven into the Caucasus. The story of the saint's ordinatio
2 CONC n and of the establishment of the hierarchy is told with the same adornment. He baptized four million persons in seven days. He ordained and sent out twelve apostolic bishops, and sons of heathen prie
2 CONC sts. Eventually he ruled a church of four hundred bishops and priests too numerous to count. He and Trdat hear of Constantine's conversion; they set out with an army of 70,000 men to congratulate him.
2 CONC  Constantine, who had just been baptized at Rome by Pope Silvester, forms an alliance with Trdat; the pope warmly welcomes Gregory (there are a number of forged letters between Silvester and Gregory, 
2 CONC see below) -- and so on. It would not be difficult to find the models for all these stories. Gregory in the pit acts like Daniel in the lion's den. Trdat as a boar is Nabuchodonosor; the battles of th
2 CONC e king's army against the heather and their gods have obvious precedents in the Old Testament. Gregory is now Elias, now Isaias, now John the Baptist, till his sending out his twelve apostles suggests
2 CONC  a still greater model. The writer of the life calls himself Agathangelos, chamberlain or secretary of King Trdat. It was composed from vaious sources after the year 456 (see Gutschmid, below) in Arme
2 CONC nian, though sources may have been partly Greek or Syriac (cf. Lagarde). The life was soon translated into Greek used by Symeon Metaphrastes, and further rendered into Latin in the tenth century. Duri
2 CONC ng the Middle Ages this life was the invariable source for the saint's history. The Armenians (Monophysites and Uniates) keep the feast of their apostle on 30 September, when his relics were deposed a
2 CONC t Thortan. They have many other feasts to commemorate his birth (August 5), sufferings (February 4), going into the pit ( February 28), coming out of the pit (October 19), etc. (Niles "Kalendarium Man
2 CONC uale", 2nd ed., Innsbruck 1897, II, 577). The Byzantine Church keeps his feast (Gregorios ho phoster) on 30 September, as do also the Syrians (Nilles, I, 290-292). Pope Gregory XVI, in September, 1837
2 CONC , admitted his namesake to the Reman Calendar; and appointed 1 October as his feast (among the festa pro aliquibus locis).

2 CONT <p>Gregory the Illuminator (from the Catholic Encyclopedia)</p>
2 CONT <p>Born 257?; died 337?, surnamed the Illuminator (Lusavorich).</p>
2 CONT <p>Gregory the Illuminator is the apostle, national saint, and patron of Armenia. He was not the first who introduced Christianity into that country. The Armenians maintain that the faith was preached
2 CONC  there by the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddaeus. Thaddaeus especially (the hero of the story of King Abgar of Edessa and the portrait of Christ) has been taken over by the Armenians, with the whole s
2 CONC tory. Abgar in their version becomes a King of Armenia; thus their land is the first of all to turn Christian. It is certain that there were Christians, even bishops, in Armenia before St. Gregory. Th
2 CONC e south Edessa and Nisibis especially, which accounts for the Armenian adoption of the Edessene story. A certain Dionysius of Alexandria (248-265) wrote them a letter "about penitence" (Euseb., "Hist.
2 CONC  Eccl.", VI, xlvi). This earliest Church was then destroyed by the Persians. Ardashir I, the founder of the Sassanid dynasty (226), restored, even extended, the old power of Persia. Armenia, always th
2 CONC e exposed frontier state between Rome and Persia, was overrun by Ardashir's army (Khosrov I of Armenia had taken the side of the old Arsacid dynasty); and the principle of uniformity in the Mazdean re
2 CONC ligion, that the Sassanids made a chief feature of their policy, was also applied to the subject kingdom. A Parthian named Anak murdered Khosrov by Ardashir's orders, who then tried to exterminate the
2 CONC  whole Armenian royal family. But a son of Khosrov, Trdat (Tiridates), escaped was trained in the Roman army, and eventually came back to drive out the persians and restore the Armenian kingdom.
2 CONT <p>In this restoration St. Gregory played an important part. He had been brought up as a Christian at Caesarea in Cappadocia. He seems to have belonged to an illustrious Armenian family. He was marrie
2 CONC d and had two sons (called Aristakes and Bardanes in the Greek text of Moses of Kkhorni; see below). Gregory, after being himself persecuted by King Trdat, who at first defended the old Armenian relig
2 CONC ion, eventually converted him, and with him spread the Christian faith throughout the country. Trdat became so much a Christian that he made Christianity the national faith; the nobility seem to have 
2 CONC followed his example easily, then the people followed -- or were induced to follow -- too. This happened while Diocletian was emperor (284-305), so that Armenia has a right to her claim of being the f
2 CONC irst Christian State. The temples were made into churches and the people baptized in thousands. So completely were the remains of the old heathendom effaced that we know practically nothing about the 
2 CONC original Armenian religion (as distinct from Mazdeism), except the names of some gods whose temples were destroyed or converted (the chief temple at Ashtishat was dedicated to Vahagn, Anahit and Astli
2 CONC k; Vanatur was worshipped in the North round Mount Ararat, etc.). Meanwhile Gregory had gone back to Caessarea to be ordained. Leontius of Caesarea made him bishop of the Armenians; from this time til
2 CONC l the Monophysite schism the Church of Armenia depended on Casearea, and the Armenian primates (called Catholicoi, only much later patriarchs) went there to be ordained. Gregory set up other bishops t
2 CONC hroughout the land and fixed his residence at Ashtishat (in the province of Taron), where the temple had been made into the church of Christ, "mother of all Armenian churches". He preached in the nati
2 CONC onal language and used it for the liturgy. This, too, helped to give the Armenian Church the markedly national character that it still has, more, perhaps, than any other in Christendom. Towards the en
2 CONC d of his life he retired and was succeeded as Catholicos by his son Aristakes. Aristakes was present at the First General Council, in 325. Gregory died and was buried at Thortan. A monastery was built

2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>Det historiska Armenien</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det ursprungliga Armenien upptog, ett flertal sekel f Kr, ett stort område öster om Mindre
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Asien och söder om Kaukasus. Svarta havet och Kaspiska havet ligger i nordväst, respektive
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nordost. Söderut låg parternas och persernas mäktiga riken. Den kanske mest kända symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>för Armenien är berget Ararat, där Noaks ark ska ha strandat efter sin långa resa. (Idag ligger
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>visserligen berget strax innanför den turkiska gränsen, men det är fullt synligt från många
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>delar av landet.)</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Namnet Ararat är nära besläktat med Urartu, assyriernas namn på det kungarike som en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gång låg på samma plats som det historiska Armenien. Detta rike nådde sin höjdpunkt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>omkring 800-talet till 500-talet f Kr och var då en stark konkurrent till det mäktiga Assyrien,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>om makten i området. En annan historiskt och symboliskt viktig plats är Araxesdalen, som är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mycket bördig och som av vissa påstås vara det ursprungliga Edens lustgård.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>När Urartu-riket gick under ca 590 f Kr kom olika stammar invandrande till området.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tillsammans kallade de sig för Hayastan, vilket fortfarande är det armeniska språkets
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>benämning på Armenien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tre hjältar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska historien skulle kunna skrivas mycket lång och händelserik, men de första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>femhundra åren e Kr skulle kunna sammanfattas runt tre historiska hjältar, vilka alla har sin
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>plats i den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>189 f Kr utgjorde delar av Armenien en provins inom det seleukidiska riket, men detta år
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inleddes även något som skulle bli den armeniska storhetstiden. Arthases (Artaxias) utropade
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nämligen en del av området till ett självständigt kungadöme, vilket under den närmaste
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>följande tiden fick flera efterföljare. Med tiden kom de att närma sig varandra, för att sedan,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under kung Tigran den store (95 – 56 f Kr) bli enade till en nation. Det var också under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>honom som det historiska Armenien nådde sin geografiskt sett största utbredning, omfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bland annat delar av Mesopotamien, Syrien, Cilicien och ända ner mot Palestina. Visserligen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hann riket även minska en del under kung Tigrans styre, då romarna erövrade delar av landet,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>men detta talas det inte mycket om, utan det är enandet av landet som är det viktiga.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under åren 287 – 294 och 297 – 330 e Kr styrdes Armenien av kung Tirdat III. Det var
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under dennes tid som St Grigor (Gregorius), upplysaren, enligt traditionen kom till landet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ska ha omvänt kungen (och därmed hela folket) till kristendomen. Detta ska ha skett år 301
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och med stöd av detta hävdar armenierna att de utgör den äldsta kristna staten i världen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenierna det äldsta kristna folket.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Från år 430 och under ett par århundraden framöver var Armenien delat mellan Bysans i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>väst och perserna i öst. De senare inledde förföljelser mot folket för att få dem att övergå till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den persiska zoroastrismen. En nationell, armenisk armé samlades dock under general Vardan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mamikonians ledning för att kämpa mot perserna. År 451 stod ett avgörande slag vid Avrayr,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>där visserligen armenierna förlorade mot den överlägsna persiska krigsmaskinen och där
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>general Vardan dog, men armenierna garanterades rätten att förbli kristna under persisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>överhöghet. Vardan är en förebild för folkets kamp mot olika förtryckare och kampen för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>rätten att vara kristna.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ett lidande folk</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Förutom de dryga sex seklerna kring Kristi födelse har armenierna nästan alltid varit styrda av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(och ofta uppdelade mellan) andra riken. Den längsta perioden av främmande styre och även
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den som kanske har satt mest spår i dagens armeniska identitet var den turkiska/ottomanska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tiden. Redan under 1000-talets andra hälft trängde turkarna in i området och tog makten för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett par hundra år. Efter ett antal andra härskare från olika håll kom sedan Armenien åter under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>turkiskt styre på 1500-talet, något som skulle sätta ett outplånligt spår i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>historien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Genom historien har återkommande upprorsförsök mot olika ockupationsmakter så gott
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som alltid brutalt slagits ned. Detta har givit den armeniska identiteten en ständig närvaro av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det historiska lidande som folket gått igenom under århundradenas lopp. Det finns dock ett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>särskilt tillfälle som varit upphov till värre lidande än någonsin tidigare. Under 1880-talet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hade en nationell armenisk rörelse uppstått, något som inte sågs med blida ögon av de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>styrande turkarna. Svåra förföljelser kom till följd av detta, vilka kulminerade i deportation
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och systematisk utrotning av omkring 1,5 miljoner människor under och strax efter första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>världskriget. Denna ofattbara tragedi lever kvar i näst intill varje armenier idag, och går ofta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under namnet ”massakern”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Att detta ”historiens första folkmord” idag kan vara så okänt är skrämmande. Relativt sett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>var massmorden på armenier större än nazisternas utrotningsförsök av judar. De 1,5 miljoner
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som avrättades utgjorde en större del av folket än de ca 6 miljoner judar som fick sätta livet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>till under andra världskriget.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkan ger identitet</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Då armenierna saknat kungar och andra oberoende styren under större delen av historien har
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ledarskapet för nationen, och därmed också centralpunkten för identifikationen, tagits över av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska apostoliska kyrkan. De mest begåvade intellektuella har ofta blivit präster och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under lång tid var den armeniska utbildningen underställd kyrkan. Tillsammans med den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gemensamma historien av lidande och det egna språket utgör den kristna tron grundpelarna i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska kyrkan präglas av två starka särdrag. Det första är kyrkans strukturella
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>demokratiska uppbyggnad. Liksom flera andra kyrkor är den armeniska kyrkan idag uppdelad
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>i (fyra) patriarkat, i vilka patriarkerna (katolikoserna) har en stark ställning som talesmän för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska befolkningen i respektive område. Det råder dock inga motsättningar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>patriarkerna emellan, utan snarare tvärtom. I ett tal uttryckte en av dem sig på följande sätt:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”Vi är en kyrka. Vi har varit en kyrka genom århundraden. Vi ska fortsätta att vara en kyrka i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kommande århundrade.” Den, med historiska mått mätt, demokratiska och allomfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan har säkerligen många gånger motverkat splittring hos folket. Det andra karaktärsdraget
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är den på vissa punkter näst intill unika kristna läran. Framför allt är det den monofysitiska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ståndpunkten som utmärker sig, vilken utvecklas senare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det är också i ljuset av den armeniska kyrkans starka position som man bör se traditionen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>att söka rötterna tillbaka till Noas son Jafet och därmed (med hjälp av religionen) rättfärdiga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sin närvaro i det historiska Armenien. Kanske har kyrkans roll ändå varit än starkare utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska territoriet. De många armenier som genom historiens lopp levt utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hemlandet har ändå bibehållit en utpräglad känsla av etnisk egenart, generation efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>generation. Man har exempelvis betecknat kyrkan som ”det frånvarande fosterlandets synbara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>själ”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkans lära och tradition</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Trots att vissa traditioner har levt kvar sedan tiden innan kristendomens ankomst och mer
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>eller mindre har blivit accepterade av kyrkan är den armeniska läran grundad på Bibeln och de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre första allmänna (ekumeniska) kyrkomötena.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Två särarter i den armenisk-kristna traditionen är dels det s k djuroffret, matal, och dels det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>symboliska livsträdet. Djuroffret härstammar från förkristen tid, men tillämpas fortfarande på
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vissa platser. Dock ses det idag snarare som en sedvänja än en religiös handling och det finns
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>en tendens från kyrkans håll att förtiga matal-ceremonin, men man kan inte bortse ifrån att
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan på ett tidigt stadium godkände offrandet och även reglerade det i sina religiösa lagar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Livsträdet å sin sida, är ett bra exempel på den religiösa och kulturella kontinuitet som präglar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska området. Från den tidiga Urartu-kulturens många bilder av livsträdet, via
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenisk ”trädkult”, till dyrkan av Kristi kors som livsträdet har den förkristna symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”slussats in” i den kristna läran.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vid det första kyrkomötet i Nicaea år 325 representerades armenierna av Grigor,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>upplysaren, och de centrala punkterna var beslutet att Fadern, Sonen och den Helige Anden är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre personer som tillsammans bildar en gudom. Detta är en av grundpelarna i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>läran, liksom den trosbekännelse som formulerades vid mötet och som sjungs i varje armenisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mässa.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkomötet i Efesus år 431, det tredje i ordningen, konstaterade att Kristus inte bara var en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människa som utgjorde Guds tempel, utan att Kristus är Guds son och att därmed Maria inte
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bara är Kristi moder utan också Guds moder. Detta är en ståndpunkt som även den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan fasthåller, liksom majoriteten av mötets deltagare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det fjärde kyrkomötet, som hölls år 451 i Kalcedon, saknade armenisk närvaro, då de låg i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>strid med perserna vid Avarayr. När de senare fick del av mötets beslut förkastade de detta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Man kunde dels inte godta den romerske påven Leos ståndpunkt att påven av Rom skulle vara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkans överhuvud. Mötet proklamerade också tron på Kristi dubbla natur, den mänskliga och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den gudomliga. Den armeniska kyrkan hävdar istället ”tron på en enda förenad natur hos
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds enfödde son”. Detta kom att kallas den monofysitiska läran, och lever idag kvar även i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>exempelvis den koptiska och den etiopiska kyrkan.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armeniska kyrkans sakrament</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I den armeniska kyrkan räknar man till sju sakrament av vilka tre (dopet, konfirmationen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ordinationen) endast kan tas emot en gång. De sju sakramenten är:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dopet – det grundläggande sakramentet. Genom dopet förenas man med Kristi kropp och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inlemmas i Kristi kyrka. Man får syndernas förlåtelse och blir värdig att ta emot de övriga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Myron-smörjelsen/konfirmationen – följer omedelbart efter dopet. Sätter den döpta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människan i stånd att möta världens prövningar och frestelser. Nu mottager hon den helig
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anden, vilket gör henne redo att bekänna den kristna tron.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden – en mötesplats för de kristna, ett enhetens sakrament. Den plats där Kristus föder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>lemmarna i sin kropp och förenar dem med sig själv. De yttre, synliga tecknen är (det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>osyrade) brödet och vinet, som mottas av de kristna efter att ha helgats av prästen. Brödet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vinet förvandlas visserligen inte fysiskt till kött och blod, och Kristus är inte fysiskt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>närvarande, men han är det andligt.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden är en andlig reningsprocess och endast den som tror och som ångrar sina synder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kan ta del av nattvarden, annars kan man inte få del av välsignelsen. Följden blir andlig skada
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och fördömelse, men för den som bekänner sina synder blir nattvarden en överlåtelsehandling.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den som vill deltaga i den heliga måltiden måste alltså först bikta sig, ta emot absolution
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(förlåtelse) och visa att man vill göra bättring. Man måste också fasta från midnatt innan man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>går till nattvarden, den ska nämligen vara det första man tar i munnen den dagen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Bikten och botgöringen – till för dem som behöver förlåtelse för de synder de begått efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dopet. Sakramentet består av tre delar; botfärdigheten, bikten inför prästen, som uttalar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>absolutionen, samt avlösningen. Absolutionen kan endast uttalas av en präst eller någon annan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>högre kyrklig ämbetsman, vilka fått myndigheten att göra detta genom den apostoliska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>successionen. Prästen handlar här som Guds tjänare, inte som egen person. Det är endast de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som verkligen ångrar sig som kan få absolution.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ordinationen – avskiljer en medlem av Kristi kropp till en särskild tjänst inom kyrkan. Den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armeniska kyrkan har åtta olika ordinationer, fyra lägre och fyra högre. De lägre är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dörrvaktare, föreläsare, edsvärare och lampbärare. De högre är diakon, präst, biskop, samt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>katolikos.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Äktenskapet – en varaktig förening mellan man och kvinna, liksom föreningen mellan Kristus
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och kyrkan är varaktig. Äktenskapet är en förbindelse instiftad av Gud och räknas därför till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten. Idealet är egentligen kyskhet, men ”om de inte kan behärska sig bör de gifta sig;
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det är bättre att gifta sig än att brinna av åtrå” (1 Kor 7:9). Målet för äktenskapet är att skaffa
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>barn, som ska bli nya medlemmar i kyrkan. Till skillnad från de andra sakramenten finns inga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>yttre ceremonier för äktenskapet, då det innehåller sådant som inte helt ryms inom en religiös
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ram. Äktenskapets yttre sida består snarare i att man börjar leva på ett nytt sätt, än att man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>genomgår en högtidlig ceremoni. I teorin kan äktenskapet endast upplösas genom döden och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett nytt äktenskap med en skild person medan den förre maken ännu är i livet är ett brott mot
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds lag.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sjuksmörjelsen – det sjunde sakramentet, vilket handlar om en förberedelse inför döden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den gudomliga liturgin</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armenisk liturgi är fylld av vördnad för det heliga. Alla böner och ceremonier bär något av en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”klassisk skönhet” i sina utformningar. Liturgin fyller församlingen med glädje och triumf
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och allt är i botten ett uttryck för det hemlighetsfulla skeende då Gud blev till människa.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska liturgin kan delas in i tre delar; den första delen är en</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>förberedelsegudstjänst, där prästen klär sig i mässkruden och förbereder nattvarden. Del två
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är katekumenernas gudstjänst (katekumener var människor som ännu inte döpts in i den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>fornkristna församlingen och därför inte fick ta nattvarden). Den tredje delen är de troendes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gudstjänst, där nattvarden utdelas.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Liksom så mycket annat när det gäller armenierna har liturgin rötter långt tillbaka i tiden, i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den urkristna gudstjänsten. Redan på 100-talet började man fira gudstjänst efter bestämda
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>former och på 300-talet hade liturgier utformats i grekiska, koptiska syrianska och armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkor.</p>

2 CONT <p>Ledare: Armeniens historia är mycket mer än folkmordet</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Av Vahagn Avedian</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den 24 april kommer den armeniska nationen att ihågkomma 92-årsdagen av det armeniska folkmordet. Armeniska folkmordet upptar en stor del av den armeniska historien och identiteten, trots att bå
2 CONC de den armeniska identiteten och historien är betydligt större och bredare än detta enskilda moment i tiden. Det faktum att det ägde rum i en inte alltför avlägsen tid och kännetecknar ett enor
2 CONC mt förskräckligt trauma i den armeniska nationen liv är dock odiskutabelt. Om man sedan lägger till att det armeniska folkmordet är det enda folkmord i modern tid vilket öppet förnekas av arvta
2 CONC garna till dess utövare så förstår man ännu klarare varför det fortfarande, nästan ett sekel senare, upptar en viktig del i det armeniska vardagslivet och en stor portion i varje akademisk och 
2 CONC diplomatisk fråga som berör Armenien och armenier.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Men med tanke på den rika armeniska historien och kulturen, när man lägger folkmordet i perspektiv mot historien i helhet, börjar man fråga om huruvida en inte även borde börja ägna mer tid
2 CONC  för de andra aspekterna i armenisk historia och kulturarv. Detta innebär naturligtvis inte att man ska förringa intresset för folkmordet och forskningen om det. Det armeniska folkmordet, med sin 
2 CONC höjdpunkt under 1915 och 1916, kan även sägas ha pågått under hela perioden mellan 1894 och 1923, under vilken den armeniska befolkningen utsattes för massakrer och etnisk rensning av varierande
2 CONC  storlek. Sedan om man antar att den "armeniska" nationen är cirka 2 500 år gammal (med start från grannskapet för den första dokumenterade omnämningen av "Armenien" i kung Darius kilskrift som 
2 CONC ett eget land) så ser man att folkmordet utgör endast en procent av den armeniska historien. Inkluderar man även kulturarvet hos urartuerna som rättmätigt bör betraktas som inhemska förfäderna
2 CONC  (i skillnad till de immigrerande indoeuropeiska förfäderna som assimilerade de inhemska invånarna) till de moderna armenierna så minskas denna procent ännu mer.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armeniska historien och dess unika kultur, skapad som sammansmältningen av de västerländska och österländska kulturerna som kontinuerligt passerade genom denna naturliga passage som förbinder
2 CONC  Europa med Asien, har inte bara lyckats överleva tre årtusenden men även påverka och berika den globala kulturen och civilisationen. Armeniska höglandet, en naturlig förbindelse mellan dessa tv
2 CONC å kontinenter, har varit ett uppenbart val till platsen för passagen för arméer tillhörande många supermakter så väl som handelsvägar som knöt dessa två kontinenter tillsammans. Armenien, d
2 CONC å och nu, har tvingats föra en välbalanserad politik för att inte gå under i kampen mellan de två rivaliserande makterna som ständigt stred på armenisk mark.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armenien har under nästan 3 000 års existens bidragit med många faktorer, alltför många för att kunna nämnas här. En kort lista över några av dessa bidrag inkluderar generaler, administra
2 CONC törer och kejsare i det bysantinska imperiet som t.o.m. grundlade sina egna dynastier; introduceringen av den kupolförsedda arkitekturen från Öst i den västerländska byggnadskonsten och en strak
2 CONC  influens över den gotiska stilen; utgörandet av en viktig del i stommen för handelsmännen i Mellanöstern och Mindre Asien och handeln från det europeiska fastlandet till Fjärran Öster; skapar
2 CONC e av övertaliga mängder av arkitektoniska mästerverk (bl.a. de unika armeniska korsstenarna, "khatchkars") som finns upptagna bland listan över skyddade världsarv; ett unikt och högt flexibelt s
2 CONC pråk och alfabet, kapabel till skapandet av en rik litteratur så väl som dynamisk anpassning till utvecklingen i världen; och slutligen en stor mängd musiker, kompositörer, uppfinnare och entrep
2 CONC renörer. Ändå är denna lista långt ifrån helheten. Omnämningen av liknande prestationer kan uppfattas som att skryta om sin egen nation, men om man beaktar storleken på den armeniska nationen,
2 CONC  dess ålder, dess geopolitiska läge och dess äventyrliga existens, en kan inte låta bli att häpnas över överlevnadsskickligheten hos detta folk och kvantiteten och kvaliteten hos deras bedrifte
2 CONC r.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Så, även om det armeniska folkmordet, helt rättsmättigt, upptar nästan varje större område inom dagens armeniska studier av historien, dess studenter så väl som allmänheten borde kanske b
2 CONC örja ägna mer tid åt de återstående 99 procenten av armeniska historien och dess kulturella, arkitektoniska, musikala, litterära, tekniska och flera andra aspekter. Trots denna mörka en procent
2 CONC  så innehåller de resterande 99 procenten så pass många lysande stunder att deras ljus inte bör överskuggas av detta spensliga en procent, oavsett hur tungt dess börda må än vara.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Religion</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Urarterna dyrkade Guden Khaldi som deras största Gud, han var statsguden. Konungen anågs vara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Khaldis förebild eller en inkarnation av Khaldi. Förutom Khaldi fanns det två Gudar till med
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>stor betydelse, Tesheba var åsk och regn Guden och Shivini var solguden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Urarterna hade lejon och tjurar som religiösa symboler. Lejonet representerade Khaldi och tjuren
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>representerade Tesheba, Shivini representerades av solhjulet. Urarternas tempel byggdes oftast
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>på höga höjder på en kulle eller ett berg.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armeniernas förkristna religion bestod av flera gudar, andar och element. Den störste Guden hette
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aramazd och beskrevs som den store och ädle, Tir hette kunskapens Gud. Anahit som dyrkades mest

2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases V of Parthia ruled the Parthian Empire from 191 to 208. According to one theory, he was the son of Vologases I of Armenia, a member of the Parthian Arsacid dynasty's Armenia cadet branch.
2 CONC  Nevertheless, he won the succession of the senior house, following Vologases IV (147–191) on the throne of Parthia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This tree assumes a different theory: that Vologaesus V was the son of King Vologaesus IV of Parthia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His succession was not uncontested; a rival King Osroes II (190) had already set himself up in Media before the death of the previous ruler, but Vologases V appears to have quickly put him down.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases V was attacked by the Roman emperor Septimius Severus (193–211) in 195. Severus advanced into Mesopotamia, occupied Nisibis and plundered the Parthian capital Ctesiphon in 199, capturin

2 CONT <p>regerade Armenien 180-191 och Parthia 190-207</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det historiska Armenien</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det ursprungliga Armenien upptog, ett flertal sekel f Kr, ett stort område öster om Mindre
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Asien och söder om Kaukasus. Svarta havet och Kaspiska havet ligger i nordväst, respektive
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nordost. Söderut låg parternas och persernas mäktiga riken. Den kanske mest kända symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>för Armenien är berget Ararat, där Noaks ark ska ha strandat efter sin långa resa. (Idag ligger
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>visserligen berget strax innanför den turkiska gränsen, men det är fullt synligt från många
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>delar av landet.)</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Namnet Ararat är nära besläktat med Urartu, assyriernas namn på det kungarike som en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gång låg på samma plats som det historiska Armenien. Detta rike nådde sin höjdpunkt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>omkring 800-talet till 500-talet f Kr och var då en stark konkurrent till det mäktiga Assyrien,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>om makten i området. En annan historiskt och symboliskt viktig plats är Araxesdalen, som är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mycket bördig och som av vissa påstås vara det ursprungliga Edens lustgård.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>När Urartu-riket gick under ca 590 f Kr kom olika stammar invandrande till området.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tillsammans kallade de sig för Hayastan, vilket fortfarande är det armeniska språkets
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>benämning på Armenien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tre hjältar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska historien skulle kunna skrivas mycket lång och händelserik, men de första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>femhundra åren e Kr skulle kunna sammanfattas runt tre historiska hjältar, vilka alla har sin
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>plats i den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>189 f Kr utgjorde delar av Armenien en provins inom det seleukidiska riket, men detta år
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inleddes även något som skulle bli den armeniska storhetstiden. Arthases (Artaxias) utropade
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>nämligen en del av området till ett självständigt kungadöme, vilket under den närmaste
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>följande tiden fick flera efterföljare. Med tiden kom de att närma sig varandra, för att sedan,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under kung Tigran den store (95 – 56 f Kr) bli enade till en nation. Det var också under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>honom som det historiska Armenien nådde sin geografiskt sett största utbredning, omfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bland annat delar av Mesopotamien, Syrien, Cilicien och ända ner mot Palestina. Visserligen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hann riket även minska en del under kung Tigrans styre, då romarna erövrade delar av landet,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>men detta talas det inte mycket om, utan det är enandet av landet som är det viktiga.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under åren 287 – 294 och 297 – 330 e Kr styrdes Armenien av kung Tirdat III. Det var
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under dennes tid som St Grigor (Gregorius), upplysaren, enligt traditionen kom till landet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ska ha omvänt kungen (och därmed hela folket) till kristendomen. Detta ska ha skett år 301
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och med stöd av detta hävdar armenierna att de utgör den äldsta kristna staten i världen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenierna det äldsta kristna folket.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Från år 430 och under ett par århundraden framöver var Armenien delat mellan Bysans i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>väst och perserna i öst. De senare inledde förföljelser mot folket för att få dem att övergå till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den persiska zoroastrismen. En nationell, armenisk armé samlades dock under general Vardan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mamikonians ledning för att kämpa mot perserna. År 451 stod ett avgörande slag vid Avrayr,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>där visserligen armenierna förlorade mot den överlägsna persiska krigsmaskinen och där
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>general Vardan dog, men armenierna garanterades rätten att förbli kristna under persisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>överhöghet. Vardan är en förebild för folkets kamp mot olika förtryckare och kampen för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>rätten att vara kristna.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ett lidande folk</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Förutom de dryga sex seklerna kring Kristi födelse har armenierna nästan alltid varit styrda av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(och ofta uppdelade mellan) andra riken. Den längsta perioden av främmande styre och även
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den som kanske har satt mest spår i dagens armeniska identitet var den turkiska/ottomanska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tiden. Redan under 1000-talets andra hälft trängde turkarna in i området och tog makten för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett par hundra år. Efter ett antal andra härskare från olika håll kom sedan Armenien åter under
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>turkiskt styre på 1500-talet, något som skulle sätta ett outplånligt spår i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>historien.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Genom historien har återkommande upprorsförsök mot olika ockupationsmakter så gott
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som alltid brutalt slagits ned. Detta har givit den armeniska identiteten en ständig närvaro av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det historiska lidande som folket gått igenom under århundradenas lopp. Det finns dock ett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>särskilt tillfälle som varit upphov till värre lidande än någonsin tidigare. Under 1880-talet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hade en nationell armenisk rörelse uppstått, något som inte sågs med blida ögon av de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>styrande turkarna. Svåra förföljelser kom till följd av detta, vilka kulminerade i deportation
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och systematisk utrotning av omkring 1,5 miljoner människor under och strax efter första
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>världskriget. Denna ofattbara tragedi lever kvar i näst intill varje armenier idag, och går ofta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under namnet ”massakern”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Att detta ”historiens första folkmord” idag kan vara så okänt är skrämmande. Relativt sett
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>var massmorden på armenier större än nazisternas utrotningsförsök av judar. De 1,5 miljoner
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som avrättades utgjorde en större del av folket än de ca 6 miljoner judar som fick sätta livet
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>till under andra världskriget.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkan ger identitet</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Då armenierna saknat kungar och andra oberoende styren under större delen av historien har
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ledarskapet för nationen, och därmed också centralpunkten för identifikationen, tagits över av
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska apostoliska kyrkan. De mest begåvade intellektuella har ofta blivit präster och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>under lång tid var den armeniska utbildningen underställd kyrkan. Tillsammans med den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gemensamma historien av lidande och det egna språket utgör den kristna tron grundpelarna i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska identiteten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska kyrkan präglas av två starka särdrag. Det första är kyrkans strukturella
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>demokratiska uppbyggnad. Liksom flera andra kyrkor är den armeniska kyrkan idag uppdelad
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>i (fyra) patriarkat, i vilka patriarkerna (katolikoserna) har en stark ställning som talesmän för
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den armeniska befolkningen i respektive område. Det råder dock inga motsättningar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>patriarkerna emellan, utan snarare tvärtom. I ett tal uttryckte en av dem sig på följande sätt:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”Vi är en kyrka. Vi har varit en kyrka genom århundraden. Vi ska fortsätta att vara en kyrka i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kommande århundrade.” Den, med historiska mått mätt, demokratiska och allomfattande
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan har säkerligen många gånger motverkat splittring hos folket. Det andra karaktärsdraget
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är den på vissa punkter näst intill unika kristna läran. Framför allt är det den monofysitiska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ståndpunkten som utmärker sig, vilken utvecklas senare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det är också i ljuset av den armeniska kyrkans starka position som man bör se traditionen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>att söka rötterna tillbaka till Noas son Jafet och därmed (med hjälp av religionen) rättfärdiga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sin närvaro i det historiska Armenien. Kanske har kyrkans roll ändå varit än starkare utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska territoriet. De många armenier som genom historiens lopp levt utanför
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>hemlandet har ändå bibehållit en utpräglad känsla av etnisk egenart, generation efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>generation. Man har exempelvis betecknat kyrkan som ”det frånvarande fosterlandets synbara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>själ”.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkans lära och tradition</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Trots att vissa traditioner har levt kvar sedan tiden innan kristendomens ankomst och mer
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>eller mindre har blivit accepterade av kyrkan är den armeniska läran grundad på Bibeln och de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre första allmänna (ekumeniska) kyrkomötena.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Två särarter i den armenisk-kristna traditionen är dels det s k djuroffret, matal, och dels det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>symboliska livsträdet. Djuroffret härstammar från förkristen tid, men tillämpas fortfarande på
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vissa platser. Dock ses det idag snarare som en sedvänja än en religiös handling och det finns
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>en tendens från kyrkans håll att förtiga matal-ceremonin, men man kan inte bortse ifrån att
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan på ett tidigt stadium godkände offrandet och även reglerade det i sina religiösa lagar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Livsträdet å sin sida, är ett bra exempel på den religiösa och kulturella kontinuitet som präglar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det armeniska området. Från den tidiga Urartu-kulturens många bilder av livsträdet, via
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armenisk ”trädkult”, till dyrkan av Kristi kors som livsträdet har den förkristna symbolen
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”slussats in” i den kristna läran.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vid det första kyrkomötet i Nicaea år 325 representerades armenierna av Grigor,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>upplysaren, och de centrala punkterna var beslutet att Fadern, Sonen och den Helige Anden är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tre personer som tillsammans bildar en gudom. Detta är en av grundpelarna i den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>läran, liksom den trosbekännelse som formulerades vid mötet och som sjungs i varje armenisk
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mässa.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kyrkomötet i Efesus år 431, det tredje i ordningen, konstaterade att Kristus inte bara var en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människa som utgjorde Guds tempel, utan att Kristus är Guds son och att därmed Maria inte
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>bara är Kristi moder utan också Guds moder. Detta är en ståndpunkt som även den armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkan fasthåller, liksom majoriteten av mötets deltagare.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det fjärde kyrkomötet, som hölls år 451 i Kalcedon, saknade armenisk närvaro, då de låg i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>strid med perserna vid Avarayr. När de senare fick del av mötets beslut förkastade de detta.

2 CONT <p>Man kunde dels inte godta den romerske påven Leos ståndpunkt att påven av Rom skulle vara
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kyrkans överhuvud. Mötet proklamerade också tron på Kristi dubbla natur, den mänskliga och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den gudomliga. Den armeniska kyrkan hävdar istället ”tron på en enda förenad natur hos
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds enfödde son”. Detta kom att kallas den monofysitiska läran, och lever idag kvar även i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>exempelvis den koptiska och den etiopiska kyrkan.</p>

2 CONT <p>Armeniska kyrkans sakrament</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I den armeniska kyrkan räknar man till sju sakrament av vilka tre (dopet, konfirmationen och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ordinationen) endast kan tas emot en gång. De sju sakramenten är:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dopet – det grundläggande sakramentet. Genom dopet förenas man med Kristi kropp och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>inlemmas i Kristi kyrka. Man får syndernas förlåtelse och blir värdig att ta emot de övriga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Myron-smörjelsen/konfirmationen – följer omedelbart efter dopet. Sätter den döpta
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>människan i stånd att möta världens prövningar och frestelser. Nu mottager hon den helig
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anden, vilket gör henne redo att bekänna den kristna tron.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden – en mötesplats för de kristna, ett enhetens sakrament. Den plats där Kristus föder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>lemmarna i sin kropp och förenar dem med sig själv. De yttre, synliga tecknen är (det
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>osyrade) brödet och vinet, som mottas av de kristna efter att ha helgats av prästen. Brödet och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>vinet förvandlas visserligen inte fysiskt till kött och blod, och Kristus är inte fysiskt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>närvarande, men han är det andligt.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nattvarden är en andlig reningsprocess och endast den som tror och som ångrar sina synder
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>kan ta del av nattvarden, annars kan man inte få del av välsignelsen. Följden blir andlig skada
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och fördömelse, men för den som bekänner sina synder blir nattvarden en överlåtelsehandling.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den som vill deltaga i den heliga måltiden måste alltså först bikta sig, ta emot absolution
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(förlåtelse) och visa att man vill göra bättring. Man måste också fasta från midnatt innan man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>går till nattvarden, den ska nämligen vara det första man tar i munnen den dagen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Bikten och botgöringen – till för dem som behöver förlåtelse för de synder de begått efter
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dopet. Sakramentet består av tre delar; botfärdigheten, bikten inför prästen, som uttalar
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>absolutionen, samt avlösningen. Absolutionen kan endast uttalas av en präst eller någon annan
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>högre kyrklig ämbetsman, vilka fått myndigheten att göra detta genom den apostoliska
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>successionen. Prästen handlar här som Guds tjänare, inte som egen person. Det är endast de
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>som verkligen ångrar sig som kan få absolution.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ordinationen – avskiljer en medlem av Kristi kropp till en särskild tjänst inom kyrkan. Den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>armeniska kyrkan har åtta olika ordinationer, fyra lägre och fyra högre. De lägre är
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>dörrvaktare, föreläsare, edsvärare och lampbärare. De högre är diakon, präst, biskop, samt
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>katolikos.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Äktenskapet – en varaktig förening mellan man och kvinna, liksom föreningen mellan Kristus
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och kyrkan är varaktig. Äktenskapet är en förbindelse instiftad av Gud och räknas därför till
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>sakramenten. Idealet är egentligen kyskhet, men ”om de inte kan behärska sig bör de gifta sig;
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>det är bättre att gifta sig än att brinna av åtrå” (1 Kor 7:9). Målet för äktenskapet är att skaffa
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>barn, som ska bli nya medlemmar i kyrkan. Till skillnad från de andra sakramenten finns inga
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>yttre ceremonier för äktenskapet, då det innehåller sådant som inte helt ryms inom en religiös
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ram. Äktenskapets yttre sida består snarare i att man börjar leva på ett nytt sätt, än att man
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>genomgår en högtidlig ceremoni. I teorin kan äktenskapet endast upplösas genom döden och
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ett nytt äktenskap med en skild person medan den förre maken ännu är i livet är ett brott mot
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Guds lag.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sjuksmörjelsen – det sjunde sakramentet, vilket handlar om en förberedelse inför döden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den gudomliga liturgin</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Armenisk liturgi är fylld av vördnad för det heliga. Alla böner och ceremonier bär något av en
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>”klassisk skönhet” i sina utformningar. Liturgin fyller församlingen med glädje och triumf
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>och allt är i botten ett uttryck för det hemlighetsfulla skeende då Gud blev till människa.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den armeniska liturgin kan delas in i tre delar; den första delen är en</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>förberedelsegudstjänst, där prästen klär sig i mässkruden och förbereder nattvarden. Del två
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>är katekumenernas gudstjänst (katekumener var människor som ännu inte döpts in i den
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>fornkristna församlingen och därför inte fick ta nattvarden). Den tredje delen är de troendes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>gudstjänst, där nattvarden utdelas.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Liksom så mycket annat när det gäller armenierna har liturgin rötter långt tillbaka i tiden, i
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>den urkristna gudstjänsten. Redan på 100-talet började man fira gudstjänst efter bestämda
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>former och på 300-talet hade liturgier utformats i grekiska, koptiska syrianska och armeniska
2 CONT <p></p>

2 CONT <p>Parthia  was a civilization situated in the northeast of modern Iran, but at its height covering all of Iran proper, as well as regions of the modern countries of Armenia, Iraq, Georgia, eastern Tu
2 CONC rkey, eastern Syria, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kuwait, the Persian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and UAE.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia was led by the Arsacid dynasty, who reunited and ruled over the Iranian plateau, taking over the eastern provinces of the Greek Seleucid Empire, beginning in the late 3rd century BC, and in
2 CONC termittently controlled Mesopotamia between ca 150 BC and 224 AD. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the Median and the Achaemenid dynasties). Parthia (mostly due to their inventio
2 CONC n of heavy cavalry) was the arch-enemy of the Roman Empire in the east; and it limited Rome's expansion beyond Cappadocia (central Anatolia).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Scythian-Parni nomads (Assyrians called them Ashkuz) had settled in Parthia and had built a small independent kingdom, they rose to power under king Mithridates the Great (171–138 BC). 
2 CONC Later, at the height of their power, Parthian influence reached as far as Ubar in Arabia, the nexus of the frankincense trade route, where Parthian-inspired ceramics have been found. The power of the 
2 CONC early Parthian empire seems to have been overestimated by some ancient historians, who could not clearly separate the powerful later empire from its more humble obscure origins. The end of this long-l
2 CONC ived empire came in 224 AD, when the empire was loosely organized and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassals, the Persians of the Sassanid dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Little is known of the Parthians; not much of their own literature has survived. Consequently Parthian history is largely derived from foreign histories, controlled by the evidence of coins and ins
2 CONC criptions; even their own name for themselves is debatable due to a lack of domestic records. Several Greek authors, of whom we have fragments, including Apollodorus of Artemita and Isidore of Charax,
2 CONC  wrote under Parthian rule. Their power was based on a combination of the guerilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organisational skills sufficient to build and administer a vast empire - eve
2 CONC n though it never matched in power the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. Vassal kingdoms seem to have made up a large part of their territory (see Tigranes II of Armenia), and Hellenistic
2 CONC  cities enjoyed a certain autonomy; their craftsmen received employment by some Parthians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Strabo considered Parthians to be Carduchi, i.e., the inhabitants of Curdistan.[2]

2 CONT <p> Parthia as a satrapy</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia originally designated a territory southeast of the Caspian sea. It was a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire, which was conquered by Alexander the Great circa 330 BCE. Following Alexander's de
2 CONC ath, the government of Parthia was given to Nicanor, at the Partition of Babylon in 323 BCE. At the Partition of Triparadisus in 320 BCE, Parthia was given to Philip. Philip was then succeeded by Peit
2 CONC hon. From 311 BCE Parthia then became a part of the Seleucid empire, being ruled by various satraps under a Seleucid king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Andragoras (?-238 BCE) was the last Seleucid satrap of the province of "Partahia", under the Seleucid rulers Antiochus I Soter and Antiochus II Theos (Justin, xli. 4). Andragoras tried to wrestle i
2 CONC ndependence from the Seleucid Empire, at a time when the Seleucid were embroiled in conflict with Ptolemaic Egypt. In defiance, he issued coins in which he wears the royal diadem as well as his name (
2 CONC Will: I, 1966). Andragoras was a neighbour, a contemporary, and probably an ally of Diodotus I in Bactria, who also wrestled independence around the same time, giving rise to the Greco-Bactrian kingdo
2 CONC m.

2 CONT <p> The Parthian Empire</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The tribe of the Parni, a nomadic people of Iranian origin, who originally spoke an Eastern Iranian language and later known as the Parthians, entered the Iranian plateau from Central Asia. They we
2 CONC re consummate horsemen, known for the 'Parthian shot': turning backwards at full gallop to loose an arrow directly to the rear. Initially, ca. 238 BCE, their king named Arsaces (Ashk) toppled Andragor
2 CONC as and established his dynasty's independence from Seleucid rule in remote areas of northern Iran in what is today known as Turkmenistan.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"He (Arsaces) was used to a life of pillage and theft, when he heard about the defeat of Seleucus against the Gauls. Relieved from his fear of the king, he attacked the Parthians with a band of thi
2 CONC eves, vanquished their prefect Andragoras, and, after having killed him took the power over the nation" Justin, xli. 4.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The descendants of Arsaces ruled until Antiochus III the Great invaded Parthia in 209 BC, occupied the capital Hecatompylus and pushed forward into Hyrcania. The Parthian king Arsaces II apparently
2 CONC  successfully sued for peace, and Parthia recognized Seleucid authority. Antiochus III had so well secured Parthia that he moved further east into Bactria, where he fought the Greco-Bactrian king Euth
2 CONC ydemus I for three years, and then went into India.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It was not until the 2nd century BC that the Parthians were able to profit from the continuing erosion of the Seleucid Empire, gradually capturing all its territories east of Syria. Once the Parthi
2 CONC ans had gained Herat, the movement of trade along the Silk Road to China was effectively choked off and the post-Alexandrian Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was doomed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Seleucid monarchs attempted to "hold the line" against the Parthian expansion; Antiochus IV Epiphanes spent his last years on a campaign against the newly emerging Iranian states. After his dea
2 CONC th in 164 BC, the Parthians took advantage of the ensuing dynastic squabbles to make even greater gains.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>.In 139 BC, the Parthian king Mithridates I captured the Seleucid monarch Demetrius II Nicator, holding him captive for ten years while his troops overwhelmed Mesopotamia and Media.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By 129 BC the Parthians were in control of all the lands right to the Tigris, and established their winter encampment on its banks at Ctesiphon, downstream from modern Baghdad. Ctesiphon was then a
2 CONC  small suburb directly across the river from Seleucia on the Tigris, the most Hellenistic city of western Asia. Because of their need of the wealth and trade provided by Seleucia, the Parthian armies 
2 CONC limited their incursions to harassment, allowing the city to preserve its independence. In the heat of the Mesopotamian summer, the Parthian army would withdraw to the ancient Persian capitals of Susa
2 CONC  and Ecbatana (modern Hamadan).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From around 130 BCE, the Parthians suffered numerous incursions by Scythian nomads (also called the Tocharians from Bactria, possibly the Yuezhi), in which kings Phraates II and Artabanus I were su
2 CONC ccessively killed. Scythians again invaded Parthia around 90 BCE, putting king Sanatruces on the Parthian throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Government</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the conquest of Media, Assyria, Babylonia and Elam, the Parthians had to organize their empire. The former elites of these countries were Greek, and the new rulers had to adapt to their custo
2 CONC ms if they wanted their rule to last. As a result, the cities retained their ancient rights and civil administrations remained more or less undisturbed. An interesting detail is coinage: legends were 
2 CONC written in the Greek alphabet, a practice that continued until the 2nd century AD, when local knowledge of the language was in decline and few people knew how to read or write the Greek alphabet.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Another source of inspiration was the Achaemenid dynasty that had once ruled the Persian Empire. Courtiers spoke Persian and used the Pahlavi script; the royal court traveled from capital to capita
2 CONC l, and the Arsacid kings styled themselves "king of kings". It was an apt title, as in addition to his own kingdom the Parthian monarch was the overlord of some eighteen vassal kings, such as the rule
2 CONC rs of the city state Hatra, the kingdom of Characene and the ancient kingdom of Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The empire was, overall, not very centralized. There were several languages, many peoples, and a number of different economic systems. The loose ties between the separate parts of the empire were a
2 CONC  key to its survival. In the 2nd century AD, the most important capital, Ctesiphon, was captured no less than three times by the Romans (in 116, 165 and 198 AD), but the empire survived because there 
2 CONC were other centers of power. On the other hand, the fact that the empire was a mere conglomeratation of kingdoms, provinces and city-states did at times seriously weaken the Parthian state. This was a
2 CONC  major factor in the halt of the Parthian expansion after the conquests of Mesopotamia and Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Local potentates played important roles, and the king had to respect their privileges. Several noble families had votes in the Royal council; the Suren-Pahlav Clan had the right to crown the Parthi
2 CONC an king, and every aristocrat was allowed and expected to retain an army of his own. When the throne was occupied by a weak ruler, divisions among the nobility became dangerous.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The constituent parts of the empire were surprisingly independent. For example, they were allowed to strike their own coins, a privilege which in antiquity was very rare. As long as the local elite
2 CONC  paid tribute to the Parthian king, there was little interference. The system worked well: towns like Ctesiphon, Seleucia, Ecbatana, Rhagae, Hecatompylos, Nisâ, and Susa flourished.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tribute was one source of royal income; another was tolls. Parthia controlled the Silk Road, the trade route between the Mediterranean Sea and China.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian language</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian is a now-extinct ancient Northwestern Iranian language that originated in Parthia (a region in north-east of modern Iran and the Greater Khorasan, including southern part of what is today 
2 CONC known as Turkmenistan) and was the official language of the Parthian Empire under the Arsacid Dynasty (248 BC - 224 AD).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p> Contact with China</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Chinese explorer Zhang Qian, who visited the neighbouring countries of Bactria and Sogdiana in 126 BC, made the first known Chinese report on Parthia. In his accounts Parthia is named "?nx?" (C
2 CONC hinese: ??), a transliteration of "Arsacid", the name of the Parthian dynasty. Zhang Qian clearly identifies Parthia as an advanced urban civilization, which he equates to those of Dayuan (in Ferghana
2 CONC ) and Daxia (in Bactria).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"Anxi is situated several thousand li west of the region of the Great Yuezhi (in Transoxonia). The people are settled on the land, cultivating the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make 
2 CONC wine out of grapes. They have walled cities like the people of Dayuan (Ferghana), the region contains several hundred cities of various sizes. The coins of the country are made of silver and bear the 
2 CONC face of the king. When the king dies, the currency is immediately changed and new coins issued with the face of his successor. The people keep records by writing on horizontal strips of leather. To th
2 CONC e west lies Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) and to the north Yancai and Lixuan (Hyrcania)." (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Following Zhang Qian's embassy and report, commercial relations between China, Central Asia, and Parthia flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the 1st century BC: "The largest o
2 CONC f these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten partie
2 CONC s would be sent out." (Shiji, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthians were apparently very intent on maintaining good relations with China and also sent their own embassies, starting around 110 BC: "When the Han envoy first visited the kingdom of Anxi (
2 CONC Parthia), the king of Anxi dispatched a party of 20,000 horsemen to meet them on the eastern border of the kingdom... When the Han envoys set out again to return to China, the king of Anxi dispatched 
2 CONC envoys of his own to accompany them... The emperor was delighted at this." (Shiji, 123, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 97 the Chinese general Ban Chao went as far west as the Caspian Sea with 70,000 men and established direct military contacts with the Parthian Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthians also played a role in the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism from Central Asia to China. An Shih Kao, a Parthian nobleman and Buddhist missionary, went to the Chinese capital Luoyang in 1
2 CONC 48 where he established temples and became the first man to translate Buddhist scriptures into Chinese.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>.In 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus invaded Parthia, but was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae by a Parthian commander called Surena in the Greek and Latin sources, most likely a member of the Sur
2 CONC en-Pahlav Clan. This was the beginning of a series of wars that were to last for almost three centuries.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthian armies included two types of cavalry: the heavily-armed and armoured cataphracts and lightly armed but highly-mobile mounted archers. For the Romans, who relied on heavy infantry, the 
2 CONC Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they w
2 CONC ere unskilled in siege warfare. Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able to completely defeat each other.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the years following the battle of Carrhae the Romans were divided in civil war between the adherents of Pompey and those of Julius Caesar and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Although C
2 CONC aesar was eventually victorious against Pompey and was planning a campaign against Parthia, his subsequent murder led to another civil war. The Roman general Quintus Labienus, who had supported Caesar
2 CONC 's murderers and feared reprisals from his heirs, Mark Antony and Octavian (later Augustus), sided with the Parthians and eventually became the best general of king Pacorus I. In 41 BC Parthia, led by
2 CONC  Labienus, invaded Syria, Cilicia, and Caria and attacked Phrygia in Asia Minor. A second army intervened in Judaea and captured its king Hyrcanus II. The spoils were immense, and put to good use: Kin
2 CONC g Phraates IV invested them in building up Ctesiphon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 39 BC, Antony retaliated, sending out the old warhorse general Publius Ventidius Bassus and several of Caesar's crack, veteran legions to secure the conquered territories. The Parthian King Paco
2 CONC rus was killed along with Labienus, and the Euphrates again became the border between the two nations. Hoping to further avenge the death of Crassus, Antony invaded Mesopotamia in 36 BC with the Legio
2 CONC n VI Ferrata and other units. Having cavalry in support, Antony reached Armenia but ceased his advance as civil war again broke out in Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony's campaign was followed by a break in the fighting between the two empires as Rome was again embroiled in civil war. When Octavian defeated Mark Antony, he ignored the Parthians, being more 
2 CONC interested in the west. His son-in-law and future successor Tiberius negotiated a peace treaty with Phraates (20 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the same time, around the year 1, the Parthians became interested in the valley of the Indus, where they began conquering the petty kingdoms of Gandhara. One of the Parthian leaders was Gondopha
2 CONC res, king of Taxila; according to an old and widespread Christian tradition, he was baptized by the apostle Thomas. While it may sound far-fetched, the story is not altogether impossible: adherents of
2 CONC  several religions lived together in Gandara and the Punjab, and there may have been an audience for a representative of a new Jewish sect.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>War broke out again between Rome and Parthia in the 60s. Armenia had become a Roman vassal kingdom, but the Parthian king Vologases I appointed a new Armenian ruler. This was too much for the Roman
2 CONC s, and their commander Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo invaded Armenia. The result was that the Armenian king received his crown again in Rome from the emperor Nero. A compromise was worked out between the tw
2 CONC o empires: in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans.

2 CONT <p> Decline and fall</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Armenian compromise served its purpose, but nothing in it covered the deposition of an Armenian king. After 110 AD, the Parthian king Vologases III dethroned the Armenian ruler, and the Roman e
2 CONC mperor Trajan decided to invade Parthia in retaliation. War broke out in 114 AD and the Parthians were severely beaten. The Romans conquered Armenia, and in the following year, Trajan marched to the s
2 CONC outh, where the Parthians were forced to evacuate their strongholds. In 116 AD, Trajan captured Ctesiphon, and established new provinces in Assyria and Babylonia. Later that year he took the Parthian 
2 CONC capital, Susa, deposed the Parthian King Osroes I and put Parthamaspates as a puppet ruler on the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Rebellions soon broke out due to the continuing loyalty of the population to Parthia. At the same time, the diasporic Jews revolted and Trajan was forced to send an army to suppress them. Trajan ov
2 CONC ercame these troubles, but his successor Hadrian gave up the territories (117 AD).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian weaknesses also contributed to the disaster. In the first century AD, the Parthian nobility had become more powerful due to concessions by the Parthian king granting them greater powers ov
2 CONC er the land and the peasantry. Their power now rivaled the king's, while at the same time internal divisions in the Arsacid family had rendered them vulnerable.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But the end was not near, yet. In 161 AD king Vologases IV declared war against the Romans and reconquered Armenia. The Roman counter-offensive was slow, but in 165 AD, Ctesiphon fell, and the Part
2 CONC hians were only saved by the outburst of a catastrophic epidemic (probably the measles) which temporarily crippled the two empires. The Roman emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius added northern M
2 CONC esopotamia to their realm (partly as a vassal-kingdom), but as it was never secure enough for them to demilitarize the region between the Euphrates and Tigris. It remained an expensive burden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The deciding blow came thirty years later. King Vologases V had tried to reconquer Mesopotamia during another Roman civil war (193 AD), but was repulsed when general Septimius Severus counter-attac
2 CONC ked. Again, Ctesiphon was captured (198 AD), and large spoils were brought to Rome. According to a modern estimate, the gold and silver were sufficient to postpone a European economic crisis for three
2 CONC  or four decades, and the consequences of the looting for Parthia were dire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia, now impoverished and without any hope to recover the lost territories, was demoralized. The kings were forced to concede greater powers to the nobility, and the vassal kings began to waver
2 CONC  in their allegiance. In 224 AD, the Persian vassal king Ardašir revolted. Two years later, he took Ctesiphon, and this time it meant the end of Parthia, replaced by a third Persian Empire, ruled by 
2 CONC the Sassanid dynasty.

2 CONT <p>Overview of Parthian History</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prelude</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There was a district named Partukka or Partakka which was known to the Assyrians as early as the seventh century B.C., and it may have formed a part of Media. Media was conquered by Cyrus (Kurush) 
2 CONC the Great, founder of the Achaemenid empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Achaemenids ruled Iran from 550 B.C. to 330 B.C. and their authority extended from the Danube river to the Indus river at its zenith. Under the Achaemenids, there was a satrapy named Parthava, 
2 CONC probably gained by conquest between 546 and 539 B.C. during Cyrus the Great's campaign south and east of the Caspian Sea. (Debevoise, Political History, 4) At that time the satrapy included Hyrcania, 
2 CONC which lay between the Elburz mountains and the Caspian Sea. Parthava revolted in 521 B.C., but was subdued and probably remained united with Hyrcania at the death of Darius. Later it was apparently se
2 CONC parated from Hyrcania and then joined with Chorasmia. In the army of Xerxes, there was a contingent of Parthians under the command of a certain Artabazus son of Pharnaces, probably the satrap of Parth
2 CONC ia. Among the Parthians killed in Xerxes' Greek campaign was a cavalry leader named Arsaces. (Aeschylus, Persae, 4) The last ruler of the Achaemenid line was Darius III Condomannus who was defeated by
2 CONC  Alexander the Great. The Parthians fought on the side of the Achaemenids against Alexander at Arbela and Darius' satrap of Parthia, Phrataphernes, surrendered to Alexander in Hyrcania. (Arrian, Anaba
2 CONC sis, iii)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After defeat by Alexander, Amminapses, a Parthian from Egypt, was made Alexander's satrap of Parthia, which had been joined with Hyrcania. In 318 B.C. Pithon, satrap of Media, seized Parthia and in
2 CONC stalled his brother Eudamus. But other satraps became alarmed and united under Peucestas of Persis to drive Pithon back to Media. (Justin xiii, 4. 23) After 316 B.C. the province was apparently joined
2 CONC  to Bactria under the command of Stasanor. But after nearly a century of Macedonian Greek rule by Alexander and his Seleucid successors, the nearly continuous war with Egypt weakened the Seleucids to 
2 CONC the point that Diodotus of Bactria revolted and declared himself king circa 253 B.C. (Justin xli, 4. 5)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Early History</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The origins of the Parthian people are clouded. Strabo (xi, 515) says the first Arsaces was a Scythian man with the semi-nomadic Parni tribe, a part of the Dahi, nomads who lived along the Ochus (T
2 CONC ejend or lower Oxus) River, who invaded and conquered Parthia. Strabo also mentions those who claim Arsaces was a Bactrian who escaped from Diodotus after a failed revolt. Justin (xli, 1) agrees Arsac
2 CONC es was a Scythian. Frye's analysis is that we can believe the Parni origins, but it was more likely a migration than an invasion that brought them, and Arsaces, to Parthia. (History, p. 207) These peo
2 CONC ple would not be known as Parthians until they moved southward into the Persian province of Parthava sometime before 250 B.C. Achaemenian and early Greek references to "Parthians" refer to earlier inh
2 CONC abitants of Parthava, not the Arsacid Parthians. (Debevoise, Political History, 2; W. M. Montgomery, Early Empires).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthians took encouragement from Diodotus' success and in 247 B.C. rose against Andragoras, satrap of Parthia for Antichus II Theos (261-247 B.C.). This date is fixed by a double-dated tablet 
2 CONC discovered by George Smith (Assyrian Discoveries, London, 1875). The revolt was led by the brothers Arsaces and Tiridates. Arsaces became king and his name the honorific used by all subsequent Parthia
2 CONC n kings.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the second century B.C., the Parthians were able to extend their rule to Bactria, Babylonia, Susiana, and Media, and under Mithradates II (c. 123 - 88 B.C.), Parthian conquests stretched fro
2 CONC m Armenia to India. After the victories of Mithradates II, the Parthians began to claim descent from both the Greeks and the Achaemenids. They spoke a language similar to that of the Achaemenids, used
2 CONC  the Pahlavi script, and established an administrative system based on Achaemenid precedents.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian "Dark Age" c. 95 - 57 B.C.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most confused period of Parthian history is from the late years in the reign of Mithradates II (ended c. 88 B.C.) to the establishment of the sole rule of Orodes II c. 57 B.C. While Mithradates
2 CONC  II was still in power, we have coins from Gotarzes I (c. 95 - 90 B.C.), Orodes I (c. 90 - 80 B.C.). And during the period immediately following the reign of Mithradates II, we see overlapping coinage
2 CONC s of Orodes I (c. 90 - 80 B.C.), an Unknown King (I) c. 80 B.C., another Unknown King (II) (c. 80 - 70 B.C.), Sinatruces (c. 77 - 70 B.C.), and Darius of Media Atropatene (c. 70 B.C.). Phraates III ap
2 CONC pears to have consolidated control in the years around and following 70 B.C., and Orodes II took firm control c. 57 B.C. See the expanded discussion of this very confused period at the page on The Dar
2 CONC k Age in Parthian History.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Roman Contact</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 53 B.C. Crassus and over 40,000 Roman troops were annihilated by the Parthian forces of Orodes II and the peoples from the Mediterranean to the Indus understood the strength of Parthia. But by 4
2 CONC 0 B.C. even Rome had to acknowledge a Parthia whose forces, under the joint command of Pacorus I and Q. Labienus, a Roman, had struck directly into the heart of the Roman East and captured the provinc
2 CONC es of Asia, Pamphylia, Cilicia, and Syria; even as far south as Petra, Parthia's word was law. For two years this vast area, so vital to Roman interests, was under Parthian occupation. Possession of t
2 CONC he Carian and perhaps the Ionian coast by foreigners struck close to home as many Romans were native to that part of the world or did business there. The occupiers were no sooner pushed out by Ventidi
2 CONC us than another Roman army under Anthony was defeated and barely escaped annihilation at Parthian hands. [Debevoise, 208]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The tug of war with Rome on the western border of Parthia continued almost without cease while Parthia had to constantly see to other threats from the north and east. The western border between Rom
2 CONC e's dominions and Parthia gradually stabilized on the banks of the Euphrates, but war was always a threat and though major campaigns by the Romans were seen in A.D. 116, 161, 195, 217 and 232, Parthia
2 CONC  was never conquered.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Decline</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthian landed nobility gained power and influence due to their their military power and increasing rights over the land and its peasants. As these grew, they were sufficient to allow the nobl
2 CONC es to resist then defy the king, refusing to pay levies and failing to answer the call to arms that had been Parthia's source of power. Concurrently, the royal Arsacids fell to internal disagreements 
2 CONC over succession which often ended in murder and a continued slide in their power. The resulting disorganization and fragmentation of the empire made way for successful Roman incursions into Parthian t
2 CONC erritories where rich commercial centers and royal treasuries were plundered, and territories lost to invaders. Petty kings rose to fill the power void;  this power redistribution culminated in a dire
2 CONC ct attempts to overthrow the monarchy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>End of Empire</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In A.D. 224, Ardashir, Parthian governor in the Achaemenid home province of Persis (Fars), overthrew Artabanus IV and established the Sasanid dynasty. The last Parthian king, Vologases VI, issued h
2 CONC is last dated coin in A.D. 228.  The Sasanians would rule Iran until the Islamic conquest in A.D. 641. The Sasanians were ardent Zoroastrians in conflict with their Armenian subjects who originally we

2 CONT <p>Vologases V of Parthia (Parthian: Walagash, Persian: بلاش‎‎, Balāsh), known in Armenian sources as Vologases II (Armenian: Վաղարշ, Vagharsh), was king of Arsacid Armenia from to 180 
2 CONC to 191, and king of the Parthian Empire from 191 to 208. He was the son of Vologases IV (147-191).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Reign'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During his early life, he became the ruler of Armenia, succeeding Sohaemus. During his rule in Armenia, he managed in 189 to impose his son Rev I (whose mother was the sister of the Pharnavazid rul
2 CONC er Amazasp) on the Iberian throne. Vologases, after the death of his father, ascended the Parthian throne, and appointed his son Khosrov I as the ruler of Armenia. Vologases' succession, however, was 
2 CONC not uncontested; a rival King Osroes II (190) had already set himself up in Media before the death of the previous ruler, but Vologases V appears to have quickly put him down.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases V was attacked by the Roman emperor Septimius Severus (193–211) in 195. Severus advanced into Mesopotamia, occupied Nisibis and plundered the Parthian capital Ctesiphon in 199, capturin
2 CONC g many Parthians and selling them into slavery. He attempted in vain to conquer the Arabic fortress at Hatra. In 202, peace was restored with the Roman Empire in effective control the whole of Mesopot
2 CONC amia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases V later died in 208, and was succeeded by his elder son Vologases VI (208–228), but a younger son Artabanus V (216–224) rebelled and a civil war ensued.

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Pharasmanes III or P’arsman III (Georgian: ფარსმან III) was a king of Iberia (Kartli, modern central and eastern Georgia), a contemporary of the Roman emperor Antoninus
2 CONC  Pius (138-161). Professor Cyril Toumanoff suggests A.D. 135-185 as the possible years of Pharasmanes’ rule.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the medieval Georgian chronicles, P’arsman was one year old at the death of his father, Ghadam (135), whom he succeeded on the throne, and ruled under the regency of his mother Ghada
2 CONC na until he reached a legal age.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Classical sources evidence Pharasmanes’ friendly relations with Rome. According to Cassius Dio, he came to Rome as guest of Antoninus Pius, together with his wife, son, and noble retinue; he 
2 CONC was especially honored, being allowed to sacrifice in the Capitol and to have his equestrian statue in the temple of Bellona; and the emperor increased the territory of his kingdom.[1] This might have
2 CONC  happened in 154 A.D. After Julius Capitolinus, the trip to Rome has sometimes been, in confusion, attributed to the earlier Iberian king Pharasmanes II.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases IV of Parthia (Parthian: Walagash, Persian: بلاش‎‎, Balāsh) was the ruler of the Parthian Empire from 147 to 191. He was the son of Mithridates IV of Parthia (129–140).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases, during his early reign, united the two halves of the empire which had been split between his father and Vologases III of Parthia (105–147). He also reconquered the kingdom of Characene
2 CONC  which seems to have been independent since the Roman invasion of the Parthian empire under Trajan (98–117). Vologases IV may be the king Volgash of the Zoroastrian tradition, who began the gatherin
2 CONC g of the writings of Zoroaster.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Conflicts with Rome began in about 155 with a dispute, as usual, over the Kingdom of Armenia. In 162–166 the Parthians attacked the Roman Empire under Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. Although the 
2 CONC Roman–Parthian War started auspiciously for the Parthians, after the Romans recovered from the first shock and setbacks, they counterattacked and restored Sohaemus to the Armenian throne and invaded
2 CONC  the Parthian empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In this war the city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was burned to the ground by Avidius Cassius in 165. The Roman legions advanced as far as Media. 
2 CONC Vologases IV made peace but was forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The end of his reign was marred by the revolt of Osroes II of Parthia (190), who appears to have set himself up in Media as a rival King in hope of succeeding Vologases IV. In the event the son of 
2 CONC Vologases IV, Vologases V (191–208) of the Arsacid cadet branch dynasty, ruling Armenia, won the succession, and appears to have quickly put down Osroes II.

2 CONT <p>Parthia  was a civilization situated in the northeast of modern Iran, but at its height covering all of Iran proper, as well as regions of the modern countries of Armenia, Iraq, Georgia, eastern Tu

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia was led by the Arsacid dynasty, who reunited and ruled over the Iranian plateau, taking over the eastern provinces of the Greek Seleucid Empire, beginning in the late 3rd century BC, and in
2 CONC termittently controlled Mesopotamia between ca 150 BC and 224 AD. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the Median and the Achaemenid dynasties). Parthia (mostly due to their inventio
2 CONC n of heavy cavalry) was the arch-enemy of the Roman Empire in the east; and it limited Rome's expansion beyond Cappadocia (central Anatolia).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Scythian-Parni nomads (Assyrians called them Ashkuz) had settled in Parthia and had built a small independent kingdom, they rose to power under king Mithridates the Great (171–138 BC). 
2 CONC Later, at the height of their power, Parthian influence reached as far as Ubar in Arabia, the nexus of the frankincense trade route, where Parthian-inspired ceramics have been found. The power of the 
2 CONC early Parthian empire seems to have been overestimated by some ancient historians, who could not clearly separate the powerful later empire from its more humble obscure origins. The end of this long-l
2 CONC ived empire came in 224 AD, when the empire was loosely organized and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassals, the Persians of the Sassanid dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Little is known of the Parthians; not much of their own literature has survived. Consequently Parthian history is largely derived from foreign histories, controlled by the evidence of coins and ins
2 CONC criptions; even their own name for themselves is debatable due to a lack of domestic records. Several Greek authors, of whom we have fragments, including Apollodorus of Artemita and Isidore of Charax,
2 CONC  wrote under Parthian rule. Their power was based on a combination of the guerilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organisational skills sufficient to build and administer a vast empire - eve
2 CONC n though it never matched in power the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. Vassal kingdoms seem to have made up a large part of their territory (see Tigranes II of Armenia), and Hellenistic
2 CONC  cities enjoyed a certain autonomy; their craftsmen received employment by some Parthians.

2 CONT <p> Parthia as a satrapy</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia originally designated a territory southeast of the Caspian sea. It was a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire, which was conquered by Alexander the Great circa 330 BCE. Following Alexander's de
2 CONC ath, the government of Parthia was given to Nicanor, at the Partition of Babylon in 323 BCE. At the Partition of Triparadisus in 320 BCE, Parthia was given to Philip. Philip was then succeeded by Peit
2 CONC hon. From 311 BCE Parthia then became a part of the Seleucid empire, being ruled by various satraps under a Seleucid king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Andragoras (?-238 BCE) was the last Seleucid satrap of the province of "Partahia", under the Seleucid rulers Antiochus I Soter and Antiochus II Theos (Justin, xli. 4). Andragoras tried to wrestle i
2 CONC ndependence from the Seleucid Empire, at a time when the Seleucid were embroiled in conflict with Ptolemaic Egypt. In defiance, he issued coins in which he wears the royal diadem as well as his name (
2 CONC Will: I, 1966). Andragoras was a neighbour, a contemporary, and probably an ally of Diodotus I in Bactria, who also wrestled independence around the same time, giving rise to the Greco-Bactrian kingdo
2 CONC m.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p> The Parthian Empire</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The tribe of the Parni, a nomadic people of Iranian origin, who originally spoke an Eastern Iranian language and later known as the Parthians, entered the Iranian plateau from Central Asia. They we
2 CONC re consummate horsemen, known for the 'Parthian shot': turning backwards at full gallop to loose an arrow directly to the rear. Initially, ca. 238 BCE, their king named Arsaces (Ashk) toppled Andragor
2 CONC as and established his dynasty's independence from Seleucid rule in remote areas of northern Iran in what is today known as Turkmenistan.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"He (Arsaces) was used to a life of pillage and theft, when he heard about the defeat of Seleucus against the Gauls. Relieved from his fear of the king, he attacked the Parthians with a band of thi
2 CONC eves, vanquished their prefect Andragoras, and, after having killed him took the power over the nation" Justin, xli. 4.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The descendants of Arsaces ruled until Antiochus III the Great invaded Parthia in 209 BC, occupied the capital Hecatompylus and pushed forward into Hyrcania. The Parthian king Arsaces II apparently
2 CONC  successfully sued for peace, and Parthia recognized Seleucid authority. Antiochus III had so well secured Parthia that he moved further east into Bactria, where he fought the Greco-Bactrian king Euth
2 CONC ydemus I for three years, and then went into India.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It was not until the 2nd century BC that the Parthians were able to profit from the continuing erosion of the Seleucid Empire, gradually capturing all its territories east of Syria. Once the Parthi
2 CONC ans had gained Herat, the movement of trade along the Silk Road to China was effectively choked off and the post-Alexandrian Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was doomed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Seleucid monarchs attempted to "hold the line" against the Parthian expansion; Antiochus IV Epiphanes spent his last years on a campaign against the newly emerging Iranian states. After his dea
2 CONC th in 164 BC, the Parthians took advantage of the ensuing dynastic squabbles to make even greater gains.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>.In 139 BC, the Parthian king Mithridates I captured the Seleucid monarch Demetrius II Nicator, holding him captive for ten years while his troops overwhelmed Mesopotamia and Media.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By 129 BC the Parthians were in control of all the lands right to the Tigris, and established their winter encampment on its banks at Ctesiphon, downstream from modern Baghdad. Ctesiphon was then a
2 CONC  small suburb directly across the river from Seleucia on the Tigris, the most Hellenistic city of western Asia. Because of their need of the wealth and trade provided by Seleucia, the Parthian armies 
2 CONC limited their incursions to harassment, allowing the city to preserve its independence. In the heat of the Mesopotamian summer, the Parthian army would withdraw to the ancient Persian capitals of Susa
2 CONC  and Ecbatana (modern Hamadan).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From around 130 BCE, the Parthians suffered numerous incursions by Scythian nomads (also called the Tocharians from Bactria, possibly the Yuezhi), in which kings Phraates II and Artabanus I were su
2 CONC ccessively killed. Scythians again invaded Parthia around 90 BCE, putting king Sanatruces on the Parthian throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Government</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the conquest of Media, Assyria, Babylonia and Elam, the Parthians had to organize their empire. The former elites of these countries were Greek, and the new rulers had to adapt to their custo
2 CONC ms if they wanted their rule to last. As a result, the cities retained their ancient rights and civil administrations remained more or less undisturbed. An interesting detail is coinage: legends were 
2 CONC written in the Greek alphabet, a practice that continued until the 2nd century AD, when local knowledge of the language was in decline and few people knew how to read or write the Greek alphabet.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Another source of inspiration was the Achaemenid dynasty that had once ruled the Persian Empire. Courtiers spoke Persian and used the Pahlavi script; the royal court traveled from capital to capita
2 CONC l, and the Arsacid kings styled themselves "king of kings". It was an apt title, as in addition to his own kingdom the Parthian monarch was the overlord of some eighteen vassal kings, such as the rule
2 CONC rs of the city state Hatra, the kingdom of Characene and the ancient kingdom of Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The empire was, overall, not very centralized. There were several languages, many peoples, and a number of different economic systems. The loose ties between the separate parts of the empire were a
2 CONC  key to its survival. In the 2nd century AD, the most important capital, Ctesiphon, was captured no less than three times by the Romans (in 116, 165 and 198 AD), but the empire survived because there 
2 CONC were other centers of power. On the other hand, the fact that the empire was a mere conglomeratation of kingdoms, provinces and city-states did at times seriously weaken the Parthian state. This was a
2 CONC  major factor in the halt of the Parthian expansion after the conquests of Mesopotamia and Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Local potentates played important roles, and the king had to respect their privileges. Several noble families had votes in the Royal council; the Suren-Pahlav Clan had the right to crown the Parthi
2 CONC an king, and every aristocrat was allowed and expected to retain an army of his own. When the throne was occupied by a weak ruler, divisions among the nobility became dangerous.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The constituent parts of the empire were surprisingly independent. For example, they were allowed to strike their own coins, a privilege which in antiquity was very rare. As long as the local elite
2 CONC  paid tribute to the Parthian king, there was little interference. The system worked well: towns like Ctesiphon, Seleucia, Ecbatana, Rhagae, Hecatompylos, Nisâ, and Susa flourished.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tribute was one source of royal income; another was tolls. Parthia controlled the Silk Road, the trade route between the Mediterranean Sea and China.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian language</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian is a now-extinct ancient Northwestern Iranian language that originated in Parthia (a region in north-east of modern Iran and the Greater Khorasan, including southern part of what is today 
2 CONC known as Turkmenistan) and was the official language of the Parthian Empire under the Arsacid Dynasty (248 BC - 224 AD).

2 CONT <p> Contact with China</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Chinese explorer Zhang Qian, who visited the neighbouring countries of Bactria and Sogdiana in 126 BC, made the first known Chinese report on Parthia. In his accounts Parthia is named "?nx?" (C
2 CONC hinese: ??), a transliteration of "Arsacid", the name of the Parthian dynasty. Zhang Qian clearly identifies Parthia as an advanced urban civilization, which he equates to those of Dayuan (in Ferghana
2 CONC ) and Daxia (in Bactria).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"Anxi is situated several thousand li west of the region of the Great Yuezhi (in Transoxonia). The people are settled on the land, cultivating the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make 
2 CONC wine out of grapes. They have walled cities like the people of Dayuan (Ferghana), the region contains several hundred cities of various sizes. The coins of the country are made of silver and bear the 
2 CONC face of the king. When the king dies, the currency is immediately changed and new coins issued with the face of his successor. The people keep records by writing on horizontal strips of leather. To th
2 CONC e west lies Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) and to the north Yancai and Lixuan (Hyrcania)." (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Following Zhang Qian's embassy and report, commercial relations between China, Central Asia, and Parthia flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the 1st century BC: "The largest o
2 CONC f these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten partie
2 CONC s would be sent out." (Shiji, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthians were apparently very intent on maintaining good relations with China and also sent their own embassies, starting around 110 BC: "When the Han envoy first visited the kingdom of Anxi (
2 CONC Parthia), the king of Anxi dispatched a party of 20,000 horsemen to meet them on the eastern border of the kingdom... When the Han envoys set out again to return to China, the king of Anxi dispatched 
2 CONC envoys of his own to accompany them... The emperor was delighted at this." (Shiji, 123, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 97 the Chinese general Ban Chao went as far west as the Caspian Sea with 70,000 men and established direct military contacts with the Parthian Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthians also played a role in the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism from Central Asia to China. An Shih Kao, a Parthian nobleman and Buddhist missionary, went to the Chinese capital Luoyang in 1
2 CONC 48 where he established temples and became the first man to translate Buddhist scriptures into Chinese.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>.In 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus invaded Parthia, but was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae by a Parthian commander called Surena in the Greek and Latin sources, most likely a member of the Sur
2 CONC en-Pahlav Clan. This was the beginning of a series of wars that were to last for almost three centuries.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthian armies included two types of cavalry: the heavily-armed and armoured cataphracts and lightly armed but highly-mobile mounted archers. For the Romans, who relied on heavy infantry, the 
2 CONC Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they w
2 CONC ere unskilled in siege warfare. Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able to completely defeat each other.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the years following the battle of Carrhae the Romans were divided in civil war between the adherents of Pompey and those of Julius Caesar and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Although C
2 CONC aesar was eventually victorious against Pompey and was planning a campaign against Parthia, his subsequent murder led to another civil war. The Roman general Quintus Labienus, who had supported Caesar
2 CONC 's murderers and feared reprisals from his heirs, Mark Antony and Octavian (later Augustus), sided with the Parthians and eventually became the best general of king Pacorus I. In 41 BC Parthia, led by
2 CONC  Labienus, invaded Syria, Cilicia, and Caria and attacked Phrygia in Asia Minor. A second army intervened in Judaea and captured its king Hyrcanus II. The spoils were immense, and put to good use: Kin
2 CONC g Phraates IV invested them in building up Ctesiphon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 39 BC, Antony retaliated, sending out the old warhorse general Publius Ventidius Bassus and several of Caesar's crack, veteran legions to secure the conquered territories. The Parthian King Paco
2 CONC rus was killed along with Labienus, and the Euphrates again became the border between the two nations. Hoping to further avenge the death of Crassus, Antony invaded Mesopotamia in 36 BC with the Legio
2 CONC n VI Ferrata and other units. Having cavalry in support, Antony reached Armenia but ceased his advance as civil war again broke out in Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony's campaign was followed by a break in the fighting between the two empires as Rome was again embroiled in civil war. When Octavian defeated Mark Antony, he ignored the Parthians, being more 
2 CONC interested in the west. His son-in-law and future successor Tiberius negotiated a peace treaty with Phraates (20 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the same time, around the year 1, the Parthians became interested in the valley of the Indus, where they began conquering the petty kingdoms of Gandhara. One of the Parthian leaders was Gondopha
2 CONC res, king of Taxila; according to an old and widespread Christian tradition, he was baptized by the apostle Thomas. While it may sound far-fetched, the story is not altogether impossible: adherents of
2 CONC  several religions lived together in Gandara and the Punjab, and there may have been an audience for a representative of a new Jewish sect.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>War broke out again between Rome and Parthia in the 60s. Armenia had become a Roman vassal kingdom, but the Parthian king Vologases I appointed a new Armenian ruler. This was too much for the Roman
2 CONC s, and their commander Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo invaded Armenia. The result was that the Armenian king received his crown again in Rome from the emperor Nero. A compromise was worked out between the tw
2 CONC o empires: in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans.

2 CONT <p>Also during the 1st century BC, the Parthians started to make inroads into eastern territories that had been occupied by the Indo-Scythians and the Yuezhi. The Parthians gained control of parts of 
2 CONC Bactria and extensive South Asian territories in modern day Pakistan, after defeating local rulers such as the Kushan Empire ruler Kujula Kadphises, in the Gandhara region.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Around 20 AD, Gondophares, one of the Parthian conquerors, declared his independence from the Parthian empire and established the Indo-Parthian Kingdom in the conquered territories.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p> Decline and fall</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Armenian compromise served its purpose, but nothing in it covered the deposition of an Armenian king. After 110 AD, the Parthian king Vologases III dethroned the Armenian ruler, and the Roman e
2 CONC mperor Trajan decided to invade Parthia in retaliation. War broke out in 114 AD and the Parthians were severely beaten. The Romans conquered Armenia, and in the following year, Trajan marched to the s
2 CONC outh, where the Parthians were forced to evacuate their strongholds. In 116 AD, Trajan captured Ctesiphon, and established new provinces in Assyria and Babylonia. Later that year he took the Parthian 
2 CONC capital, Susa, deposed the Parthian King Osroes I and put Parthamaspates as a puppet ruler on the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Rebellions soon broke out due to the continuing loyalty of the population to Parthia. At the same time, the diasporic Jews revolted and Trajan was forced to send an army to suppress them. Trajan ov
2 CONC ercame these troubles, but his successor Hadrian gave up the territories (117 AD).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian weaknesses also contributed to the disaster. In the first century AD, the Parthian nobility had become more powerful due to concessions by the Parthian king granting them greater powers ov
2 CONC er the land and the peasantry. Their power now rivaled the king's, while at the same time internal divisions in the Arsacid family had rendered them vulnerable.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But the end was not near, yet. In 161 AD king Vologases IV declared war against the Romans and reconquered Armenia. The Roman counter-offensive was slow, but in 165 AD, Ctesiphon fell, and the Part
2 CONC hians were only saved by the outburst of a catastrophic epidemic (probably the measles) which temporarily crippled the two empires. The Roman emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius added northern M
2 CONC esopotamia to their realm (partly as a vassal-kingdom), but as it was never secure enough for them to demilitarize the region between the Euphrates and Tigris. It remained an expensive burden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The deciding blow came thirty years later. King Vologases V had tried to reconquer Mesopotamia during another Roman civil war (193 AD), but was repulsed when general Septimius Severus counter-attac
2 CONC ked. Again, Ctesiphon was captured (198 AD), and large spoils were brought to Rome. According to a modern estimate, the gold and silver were sufficient to postpone a European economic crisis for three
2 CONC  or four decades, and the consequences of the looting for Parthia were dire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia, now impoverished and without any hope to recover the lost territories, was demoralized. The kings were forced to concede greater powers to the nobility, and the vassal kings began to waver
2 CONC  in their allegiance. In 224 AD, the Persian vassal king Ardašir revolted. Two years later, he took Ctesiphon, and this time it meant the end of Parthia, replaced by a third Persian Empire, ruled by 
2 CONC the Sassanid dynasty.

2 CONT <p>Overview of Parthian History</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prelude</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There was a district named Partukka or Partakka which was known to the Assyrians as early as the seventh century B.C., and it may have formed a part of Media. Media was conquered by Cyrus (Kurush) 
2 CONC the Great, founder of the Achaemenid empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Achaemenids ruled Iran from 550 B.C. to 330 B.C. and their authority extended from the Danube river to the Indus river at its zenith. Under the Achaemenids, there was a satrapy named Parthava, 
2 CONC probably gained by conquest between 546 and 539 B.C. during Cyrus the Great's campaign south and east of the Caspian Sea. (Debevoise, Political History, 4) At that time the satrapy included Hyrcania, 
2 CONC which lay between the Elburz mountains and the Caspian Sea. Parthava revolted in 521 B.C., but was subdued and probably remained united with Hyrcania at the death of Darius. Later it was apparently se
2 CONC parated from Hyrcania and then joined with Chorasmia. In the army of Xerxes, there was a contingent of Parthians under the command of a certain Artabazus son of Pharnaces, probably the satrap of Parth
2 CONC ia. Among the Parthians killed in Xerxes' Greek campaign was a cavalry leader named Arsaces. (Aeschylus, Persae, 4) The last ruler of the Achaemenid line was Darius III Condomannus who was defeated by
2 CONC  Alexander the Great. The Parthians fought on the side of the Achaemenids against Alexander at Arbela and Darius' satrap of Parthia, Phrataphernes, surrendered to Alexander in Hyrcania. (Arrian, Anaba
2 CONC sis, iii)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After defeat by Alexander, Amminapses, a Parthian from Egypt, was made Alexander's satrap of Parthia, which had been joined with Hyrcania. In 318 B.C. Pithon, satrap of Media, seized Parthia and in
2 CONC stalled his brother Eudamus. But other satraps became alarmed and united under Peucestas of Persis to drive Pithon back to Media. (Justin xiii, 4. 23) After 316 B.C. the province was apparently joined
2 CONC  to Bactria under the command of Stasanor. But after nearly a century of Macedonian Greek rule by Alexander and his Seleucid successors, the nearly continuous war with Egypt weakened the Seleucids to 
2 CONC the point that Diodotus of Bactria revolted and declared himself king circa 253 B.C. (Justin xli, 4. 5)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Early History</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The origins of the Parthian people are clouded. Strabo (xi, 515) says the first Arsaces was a Scythian man with the semi-nomadic Parni tribe, a part of the Dahi, nomads who lived along the Ochus (T
2 CONC ejend or lower Oxus) River, who invaded and conquered Parthia. Strabo also mentions those who claim Arsaces was a Bactrian who escaped from Diodotus after a failed revolt. Justin (xli, 1) agrees Arsac
2 CONC es was a Scythian. Frye's analysis is that we can believe the Parni origins, but it was more likely a migration than an invasion that brought them, and Arsaces, to Parthia. (History, p. 207) These peo
2 CONC ple would not be known as Parthians until they moved southward into the Persian province of Parthava sometime before 250 B.C. Achaemenian and early Greek references to "Parthians" refer to earlier inh
2 CONC abitants of Parthava, not the Arsacid Parthians. (Debevoise, Political History, 2; W. M. Montgomery, Early Empires).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthians took encouragement from Diodotus' success and in 247 B.C. rose against Andragoras, satrap of Parthia for Antichus II Theos (261-247 B.C.). This date is fixed by a double-dated tablet 
2 CONC discovered by George Smith (Assyrian Discoveries, London, 1875). The revolt was led by the brothers Arsaces and Tiridates. Arsaces became king and his name the honorific used by all subsequent Parthia
2 CONC n kings.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the second century B.C., the Parthians were able to extend their rule to Bactria, Babylonia, Susiana, and Media, and under Mithradates II (c. 123 - 88 B.C.), Parthian conquests stretched fro
2 CONC m Armenia to India. After the victories of Mithradates II, the Parthians began to claim descent from both the Greeks and the Achaemenids. They spoke a language similar to that of the Achaemenids, used
2 CONC  the Pahlavi script, and established an administrative system based on Achaemenid precedents.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian "Dark Age" c. 95 - 57 B.C.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most confused period of Parthian history is from the late years in the reign of Mithradates II (ended c. 88 B.C.) to the establishment of the sole rule of Orodes II c. 57 B.C. While Mithradates
2 CONC  II was still in power, we have coins from Gotarzes I (c. 95 - 90 B.C.), Orodes I (c. 90 - 80 B.C.). And during the period immediately following the reign of Mithradates II, we see overlapping coinage
2 CONC s of Orodes I (c. 90 - 80 B.C.), an Unknown King (I) c. 80 B.C., another Unknown King (II) (c. 80 - 70 B.C.), Sinatruces (c. 77 - 70 B.C.), and Darius of Media Atropatene (c. 70 B.C.). Phraates III ap
2 CONC pears to have consolidated control in the years around and following 70 B.C., and Orodes II took firm control c. 57 B.C. See the expanded discussion of this very confused period at the page on The Dar
2 CONC k Age in Parthian History.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Roman Contact</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 53 B.C. Crassus and over 40,000 Roman troops were annihilated by the Parthian forces of Orodes II and the peoples from the Mediterranean to the Indus understood the strength of Parthia. But by 4
2 CONC 0 B.C. even Rome had to acknowledge a Parthia whose forces, under the joint command of Pacorus I and Q. Labienus, a Roman, had struck directly into the heart of the Roman East and captured the provinc
2 CONC es of Asia, Pamphylia, Cilicia, and Syria; even as far south as Petra, Parthia's word was law. For two years this vast area, so vital to Roman interests, was under Parthian occupation. Possession of t
2 CONC he Carian and perhaps the Ionian coast by foreigners struck close to home as many Romans were native to that part of the world or did business there. The occupiers were no sooner pushed out by Ventidi
2 CONC us than another Roman army under Anthony was defeated and barely escaped annihilation at Parthian hands. [Debevoise, 208]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The tug of war with Rome on the western border of Parthia continued almost without cease while Parthia had to constantly see to other threats from the north and east. The western border between Rom
2 CONC e's dominions and Parthia gradually stabilized on the banks of the Euphrates, but war was always a threat and though major campaigns by the Romans were seen in A.D. 116, 161, 195, 217 and 232, Parthia
2 CONC  was never conquered.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Decline</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthian landed nobility gained power and influence due to their their military power and increasing rights over the land and its peasants. As these grew, they were sufficient to allow the nobl
2 CONC es to resist then defy the king, refusing to pay levies and failing to answer the call to arms that had been Parthia's source of power. Concurrently, the royal Arsacids fell to internal disagreements 
2 CONC over succession which often ended in murder and a continued slide in their power. The resulting disorganization and fragmentation of the empire made way for successful Roman incursions into Parthian t
2 CONC erritories where rich commercial centers and royal treasuries were plundered, and territories lost to invaders. Petty kings rose to fill the power void;  this power redistribution culminated in a dire
2 CONC ct attempts to overthrow the monarchy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>End of Empire</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In A.D. 224, Ardashir, Parthian governor in the Achaemenid home province of Persis (Fars), overthrew Artabanus IV and established the Sasanid dynasty. The last Parthian king, Vologases VI, issued h
2 CONC is last dated coin in A.D. 228.  The Sasanians would rule Iran until the Islamic conquest in A.D. 641. The Sasanians were ardent Zoroastrians in conflict with their Armenian subjects who originally we
2 CONC re Zoroastrians but subsequently embraced Christianity. The years of Sasanid rule saw a continuation of the struggle between Persia and Rome begun in the Parthian period. References to Parthia by Roma
2 CONC ns after A.D. 228 are to the Sasanid empire.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vonones II of Parthia (Persian: ونن دوم‎‎, Greek: Ονωνης, flourished second half of 1st century BC – 51) was a Prince of Iranian and Greek ancestry who served as a King of Media A
2 CONC tropatene and briefly as King of Parthia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vonones II was the second born son of an unnamed Arsacid Parthian Princess who was a relation to the King Vonones I of Parthia and her husband, the Median Atropatenian Prince, Darius. His known gra
2 CONC ndparents which were his paternal ones were the Monarchs Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene and his wife, Athenais. Vonones II had an elder brother the Parthian King Artabanus III. Vonones II was the na
2 CONC mesake of his maternal relative Vonones I, as he was born and raised in the Parthian Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prior to his Parthian Kingship from about 11 until 51, Vonones II served as a King of Media Atropatene. Little is known on his reign as King of Media Atropatene.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of his nephew Gotarzes II, Vonones II was raised to the Parthian Kingship in 51. The Kingship of Vonones II was brief. After a few months of him being appointed as King of Parthia, 
2 CONC Vonones II died and was succeeded by his son, Vologases I. Tacitus described Vonones II as “he knew neither success nor failure which have deserved to be remembered to him. It was a short and inglor
2 CONC ious reign”.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From a Greek concubine, Vonones II had 5 sons who held the thrones of Parthia and Armenia who were Pacorus II, Vologases I, Osroes I, Tiridates I and Mithridates IV. His sons were born and raised d

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia was led by the Arsacid dynasty, who reunited and ruled over the Iranian plateau, taking over the eastern provinces of the Greek Seleucid Empire, beginning in the late 3rd century BC, and in
2 CONC termittently controlled Mesopotamia between ca 150 BC and 224 AD. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the Median and the Achaemenid dynasties). Parthia (mostly due to their inventio
2 CONC n of heavy cavalry) was the arch-enemy of the Roman Empire in the east; and it limited Rome's expansion beyond Cappadocia (central Anatolia).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Scythian-Parni nomads (Assyrians called them Ashkuz) had settled in Parthia and had built a small independent kingdom, they rose to power under king Mithridates the Great (171–138 BC). 
2 CONC Later, at the height of their power, Parthian influence reached as far as Ubar in Arabia, the nexus of the frankincense trade route, where Parthian-inspired ceramics have been found. The power of the 
2 CONC early Parthian empire seems to have been overestimated by some ancient historians, who could not clearly separate the powerful later empire from its more humble obscure origins. The end of this long-l
2 CONC ived empire came in 224 AD, when the empire was loosely organized and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassals, the Persians of the Sassanid dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Little is known of the Parthians; not much of their own literature has survived. Consequently Parthian history is largely derived from foreign histories, controlled by the evidence of coins and ins
2 CONC criptions; even their own name for themselves is debatable due to a lack of domestic records. Several Greek authors, of whom we have fragments, including Apollodorus of Artemita and Isidore of Charax,
2 CONC  wrote under Parthian rule. Their power was based on a combination of the guerilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organisational skills sufficient to build and administer a vast empire - eve
2 CONC n though it never matched in power the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. Vassal kingdoms seem to have made up a large part of their territory (see Tigranes II of Armenia), and Hellenistic
2 CONC  cities enjoyed a certain autonomy; their craftsmen received employment by some Parthians.

2 CONT <p>Andragoras (?-238 BCE) was the last Seleucid satrap of the province of "Partahia", under the Seleucid rulers Antiochus I Soter and Antiochus II Theos (Justin, xli. 4). Andragoras tried to wrestle i
2 CONC ndependence from the Seleucid Empire, at a time when the Seleucid were embroiled in conflict with Ptolemaic Egypt. In defiance, he issued coins in which he wears the royal diadem as well as his name (
2 CONC Will: I, 1966). Andragoras was a neighbour, a contemporary, and probably an ally of Diodotus I in Bactria, who also wrestled independence around the same time, giving rise to the Greco-Bactrian kingdo

2 CONT <p> The Parthian Empire</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The tribe of the Parni, a nomadic people of Iranian origin, who originally spoke an Eastern Iranian language and later known as the Parthians, entered the Iranian plateau from Central Asia. They we
2 CONC re consummate horsemen, known for the 'Parthian shot': turning backwards at full gallop to loose an arrow directly to the rear. Initially, ca. 238 BCE, their king named Arsaces (Ashk) toppled Andragor
2 CONC as and established his dynasty's independence from Seleucid rule in remote areas of northern Iran in what is today known as Turkmenistan.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"He (Arsaces) was used to a life of pillage and theft, when he heard about the defeat of Seleucus against the Gauls. Relieved from his fear of the king, he attacked the Parthians with a band of thi
2 CONC eves, vanquished their prefect Andragoras, and, after having killed him took the power over the nation" Justin, xli. 4.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The descendants of Arsaces ruled until Antiochus III the Great invaded Parthia in 209 BC, occupied the capital Hecatompylus and pushed forward into Hyrcania. The Parthian king Arsaces II apparently
2 CONC  successfully sued for peace, and Parthia recognized Seleucid authority. Antiochus III had so well secured Parthia that he moved further east into Bactria, where he fought the Greco-Bactrian king Euth
2 CONC ydemus I for three years, and then went into India.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It was not until the 2nd century BC that the Parthians were able to profit from the continuing erosion of the Seleucid Empire, gradually capturing all its territories east of Syria. Once the Parthi
2 CONC ans had gained Herat, the movement of trade along the Silk Road to China was effectively choked off and the post-Alexandrian Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was doomed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Seleucid monarchs attempted to "hold the line" against the Parthian expansion; Antiochus IV Epiphanes spent his last years on a campaign against the newly emerging Iranian states. After his dea
2 CONC th in 164 BC, the Parthians took advantage of the ensuing dynastic squabbles to make even greater gains.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>.In 139 BC, the Parthian king Mithridates I captured the Seleucid monarch Demetrius II Nicator, holding him captive for ten years while his troops overwhelmed Mesopotamia and Media.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By 129 BC the Parthians were in control of all the lands right to the Tigris, and established their winter encampment on its banks at Ctesiphon, downstream from modern Baghdad. Ctesiphon was then a
2 CONC  small suburb directly across the river from Seleucia on the Tigris, the most Hellenistic city of western Asia. Because of their need of the wealth and trade provided by Seleucia, the Parthian armies 
2 CONC limited their incursions to harassment, allowing the city to preserve its independence. In the heat of the Mesopotamian summer, the Parthian army would withdraw to the ancient Persian capitals of Susa
2 CONC  and Ecbatana (modern Hamadan).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From around 130 BCE, the Parthians suffered numerous incursions by Scythian nomads (also called the Tocharians from Bactria, possibly the Yuezhi), in which kings Phraates II and Artabanus I were su
2 CONC ccessively killed. Scythians again invaded Parthia around 90 BCE, putting king Sanatruces on the Parthian throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Government</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the conquest of Media, Assyria, Babylonia and Elam, the Parthians had to organize their empire. The former elites of these countries were Greek, and the new rulers had to adapt to their custo
2 CONC ms if they wanted their rule to last. As a result, the cities retained their ancient rights and civil administrations remained more or less undisturbed. An interesting detail is coinage: legends were 
2 CONC written in the Greek alphabet, a practice that continued until the 2nd century AD, when local knowledge of the language was in decline and few people knew how to read or write the Greek alphabet.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Another source of inspiration was the Achaemenid dynasty that had once ruled the Persian Empire. Courtiers spoke Persian and used the Pahlavi script; the royal court traveled from capital to capita
2 CONC l, and the Arsacid kings styled themselves "king of kings". It was an apt title, as in addition to his own kingdom the Parthian monarch was the overlord of some eighteen vassal kings, such as the rule
2 CONC rs of the city state Hatra, the kingdom of Characene and the ancient kingdom of Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The empire was, overall, not very centralized. There were several languages, many peoples, and a number of different economic systems. The loose ties between the separate parts of the empire were a
2 CONC  key to its survival. In the 2nd century AD, the most important capital, Ctesiphon, was captured no less than three times by the Romans (in 116, 165 and 198 AD), but the empire survived because there 
2 CONC were other centers of power. On the other hand, the fact that the empire was a mere conglomeratation of kingdoms, provinces and city-states did at times seriously weaken the Parthian state. This was a
2 CONC  major factor in the halt of the Parthian expansion after the conquests of Mesopotamia and Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Local potentates played important roles, and the king had to respect their privileges. Several noble families had votes in the Royal council; the Suren-Pahlav Clan had the right to crown the Parthi
2 CONC an king, and every aristocrat was allowed and expected to retain an army of his own. When the throne was occupied by a weak ruler, divisions among the nobility became dangerous.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The constituent parts of the empire were surprisingly independent. For example, they were allowed to strike their own coins, a privilege which in antiquity was very rare. As long as the local elite
2 CONC  paid tribute to the Parthian king, there was little interference. The system worked well: towns like Ctesiphon, Seleucia, Ecbatana, Rhagae, Hecatompylos, Nisâ, and Susa flourished.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tribute was one source of royal income; another was tolls. Parthia controlled the Silk Road, the trade route between the Mediterranean Sea and China.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian language</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian is a now-extinct ancient Northwestern Iranian language that originated in Parthia (a region in north-east of modern Iran and the Greater Khorasan, including southern part of what is today 
2 CONC known as Turkmenistan) and was the official language of the Parthian Empire under the Arsacid Dynasty (248 BC - 224 AD).

2 CONT <p> Contact with China</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Chinese explorer Zhang Qian, who visited the neighbouring countries of Bactria and Sogdiana in 126 BC, made the first known Chinese report on Parthia. In his accounts Parthia is named "?nx?" (C
2 CONC hinese: ??), a transliteration of "Arsacid", the name of the Parthian dynasty. Zhang Qian clearly identifies Parthia as an advanced urban civilization, which he equates to those of Dayuan (in Ferghana
2 CONC ) and Daxia (in Bactria).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"Anxi is situated several thousand li west of the region of the Great Yuezhi (in Transoxonia). The people are settled on the land, cultivating the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make 
2 CONC wine out of grapes. They have walled cities like the people of Dayuan (Ferghana), the region contains several hundred cities of various sizes. The coins of the country are made of silver and bear the 
2 CONC face of the king. When the king dies, the currency is immediately changed and new coins issued with the face of his successor. The people keep records by writing on horizontal strips of leather. To th
2 CONC e west lies Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) and to the north Yancai and Lixuan (Hyrcania)." (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Following Zhang Qian's embassy and report, commercial relations between China, Central Asia, and Parthia flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the 1st century BC: "The largest o
2 CONC f these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten partie
2 CONC s would be sent out." (Shiji, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthians were apparently very intent on maintaining good relations with China and also sent their own embassies, starting around 110 BC: "When the Han envoy first visited the kingdom of Anxi (
2 CONC Parthia), the king of Anxi dispatched a party of 20,000 horsemen to meet them on the eastern border of the kingdom... When the Han envoys set out again to return to China, the king of Anxi dispatched 
2 CONC envoys of his own to accompany them... The emperor was delighted at this." (Shiji, 123, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 97 the Chinese general Ban Chao went as far west as the Caspian Sea with 70,000 men and established direct military contacts with the Parthian Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthians also played a role in the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism from Central Asia to China. An Shih Kao, a Parthian nobleman and Buddhist missionary, went to the Chinese capital Luoyang in 1
2 CONC 48 where he established temples and became the first man to translate Buddhist scriptures into Chinese.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>.In 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus invaded Parthia, but was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae by a Parthian commander called Surena in the Greek and Latin sources, most likely a member of the Sur
2 CONC en-Pahlav Clan. This was the beginning of a series of wars that were to last for almost three centuries.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthian armies included two types of cavalry: the heavily-armed and armoured cataphracts and lightly armed but highly-mobile mounted archers. For the Romans, who relied on heavy infantry, the 
2 CONC Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they w
2 CONC ere unskilled in siege warfare. Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able to completely defeat each other.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the years following the battle of Carrhae the Romans were divided in civil war between the adherents of Pompey and those of Julius Caesar and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Although C
2 CONC aesar was eventually victorious against Pompey and was planning a campaign against Parthia, his subsequent murder led to another civil war. The Roman general Quintus Labienus, who had supported Caesar
2 CONC 's murderers and feared reprisals from his heirs, Mark Antony and Octavian (later Augustus), sided with the Parthians and eventually became the best general of king Pacorus I. In 41 BC Parthia, led by
2 CONC  Labienus, invaded Syria, Cilicia, and Caria and attacked Phrygia in Asia Minor. A second army intervened in Judaea and captured its king Hyrcanus II. The spoils were immense, and put to good use: Kin
2 CONC g Phraates IV invested them in building up Ctesiphon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 39 BC, Antony retaliated, sending out the old warhorse general Publius Ventidius Bassus and several of Caesar's crack, veteran legions to secure the conquered territories. The Parthian King Paco
2 CONC rus was killed along with Labienus, and the Euphrates again became the border between the two nations. Hoping to further avenge the death of Crassus, Antony invaded Mesopotamia in 36 BC with the Legio
2 CONC n VI Ferrata and other units. Having cavalry in support, Antony reached Armenia but ceased his advance as civil war again broke out in Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony's campaign was followed by a break in the fighting between the two empires as Rome was again embroiled in civil war. When Octavian defeated Mark Antony, he ignored the Parthians, being more 
2 CONC interested in the west. His son-in-law and future successor Tiberius negotiated a peace treaty with Phraates (20 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the same time, around the year 1, the Parthians became interested in the valley of the Indus, where they began conquering the petty kingdoms of Gandhara. One of the Parthian leaders was Gondopha
2 CONC res, king of Taxila; according to an old and widespread Christian tradition, he was baptized by the apostle Thomas. While it may sound far-fetched, the story is not altogether impossible: adherents of
2 CONC  several religions lived together in Gandara and the Punjab, and there may have been an audience for a representative of a new Jewish sect.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>War broke out again between Rome and Parthia in the 60s. Armenia had become a Roman vassal kingdom, but the Parthian king Vologases I appointed a new Armenian ruler. This was too much for the Roman
2 CONC s, and their commander Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo invaded Armenia. The result was that the Armenian king received his crown again in Rome from the emperor Nero. A compromise was worked out between the tw
2 CONC o empires: in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans.

2 CONT <p>Also during the 1st century BC, the Parthians started to make inroads into eastern territories that had been occupied by the Indo-Scythians and the Yuezhi. The Parthians gained control of parts of

2 CONT <p> Decline and fall</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Armenian compromise served its purpose, but nothing in it covered the deposition of an Armenian king. After 110 AD, the Parthian king Vologases III dethroned the Armenian ruler, and the Roman e
2 CONC mperor Trajan decided to invade Parthia in retaliation. War broke out in 114 AD and the Parthians were severely beaten. The Romans conquered Armenia, and in the following year, Trajan marched to the s
2 CONC outh, where the Parthians were forced to evacuate their strongholds. In 116 AD, Trajan captured Ctesiphon, and established new provinces in Assyria and Babylonia. Later that year he took the Parthian 
2 CONC capital, Susa, deposed the Parthian King Osroes I and put Parthamaspates as a puppet ruler on the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Rebellions soon broke out due to the continuing loyalty of the population to Parthia. At the same time, the diasporic Jews revolted and Trajan was forced to send an army to suppress them. Trajan ov
2 CONC ercame these troubles, but his successor Hadrian gave up the territories (117 AD).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian weaknesses also contributed to the disaster. In the first century AD, the Parthian nobility had become more powerful due to concessions by the Parthian king granting them greater powers ov
2 CONC er the land and the peasantry. Their power now rivaled the king's, while at the same time internal divisions in the Arsacid family had rendered them vulnerable.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But the end was not near, yet. In 161 AD king Vologases IV declared war against the Romans and reconquered Armenia. The Roman counter-offensive was slow, but in 165 AD, Ctesiphon fell, and the Part
2 CONC hians were only saved by the outburst of a catastrophic epidemic (probably the measles) which temporarily crippled the two empires. The Roman emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius added northern M
2 CONC esopotamia to their realm (partly as a vassal-kingdom), but as it was never secure enough for them to demilitarize the region between the Euphrates and Tigris. It remained an expensive burden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The deciding blow came thirty years later. King Vologases V had tried to reconquer Mesopotamia during another Roman civil war (193 AD), but was repulsed when general Septimius Severus counter-attac
2 CONC ked. Again, Ctesiphon was captured (198 AD), and large spoils were brought to Rome. According to a modern estimate, the gold and silver were sufficient to postpone a European economic crisis for three
2 CONC  or four decades, and the consequences of the looting for Parthia were dire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia, now impoverished and without any hope to recover the lost territories, was demoralized. The kings were forced to concede greater powers to the nobility, and the vassal kings began to waver
2 CONC  in their allegiance. In 224 AD, the Persian vassal king Ardašir revolted. Two years later, he took Ctesiphon, and this time it meant the end of Parthia, replaced by a third Persian Empire, ruled by 
2 CONC the Sassanid dynasty.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prelude</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There was a district named Partukka or Partakka which was known to the Assyrians as early as the seventh century B.C., and it may have formed a part of Media. Media was conquered by Cyrus (Kurush) 
2 CONC the Great, founder of the Achaemenid empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Achaemenids ruled Iran from 550 B.C. to 330 B.C. and their authority extended from the Danube river to the Indus river at its zenith. Under the Achaemenids, there was a satrapy named Parthava, 
2 CONC probably gained by conquest between 546 and 539 B.C. during Cyrus the Great's campaign south and east of the Caspian Sea. (Debevoise, Political History, 4) At that time the satrapy included Hyrcania, 
2 CONC which lay between the Elburz mountains and the Caspian Sea. Parthava revolted in 521 B.C., but was subdued and probably remained united with Hyrcania at the death of Darius. Later it was apparently se
2 CONC parated from Hyrcania and then joined with Chorasmia. In the army of Xerxes, there was a contingent of Parthians under the command of a certain Artabazus son of Pharnaces, probably the satrap of Parth
2 CONC ia. Among the Parthians killed in Xerxes' Greek campaign was a cavalry leader named Arsaces. (Aeschylus, Persae, 4) The last ruler of the Achaemenid line was Darius III Condomannus who was defeated by
2 CONC  Alexander the Great. The Parthians fought on the side of the Achaemenids against Alexander at Arbela and Darius' satrap of Parthia, Phrataphernes, surrendered to Alexander in Hyrcania. (Arrian, Anaba
2 CONC sis, iii)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After defeat by Alexander, Amminapses, a Parthian from Egypt, was made Alexander's satrap of Parthia, which had been joined with Hyrcania. In 318 B.C. Pithon, satrap of Media, seized Parthia and in
2 CONC stalled his brother Eudamus. But other satraps became alarmed and united under Peucestas of Persis to drive Pithon back to Media. (Justin xiii, 4. 23) After 316 B.C. the province was apparently joined
2 CONC  to Bactria under the command of Stasanor. But after nearly a century of Macedonian Greek rule by Alexander and his Seleucid successors, the nearly continuous war with Egypt weakened the Seleucids to 
2 CONC the point that Diodotus of Bactria revolted and declared himself king circa 253 B.C. (Justin xli, 4. 5)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Early History</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The origins of the Parthian people are clouded. Strabo (xi, 515) says the first Arsaces was a Scythian man with the semi-nomadic Parni tribe, a part of the Dahi, nomads who lived along the Ochus (T
2 CONC ejend or lower Oxus) River, who invaded and conquered Parthia. Strabo also mentions those who claim Arsaces was a Bactrian who escaped from Diodotus after a failed revolt. Justin (xli, 1) agrees Arsac
2 CONC es was a Scythian. Frye's analysis is that we can believe the Parni origins, but it was more likely a migration than an invasion that brought them, and Arsaces, to Parthia. (History, p. 207) These peo
2 CONC ple would not be known as Parthians until they moved southward into the Persian province of Parthava sometime before 250 B.C. Achaemenian and early Greek references to "Parthians" refer to earlier inh
2 CONC abitants of Parthava, not the Arsacid Parthians. (Debevoise, Political History, 2; W. M. Montgomery, Early Empires).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthians took encouragement from Diodotus' success and in 247 B.C. rose against Andragoras, satrap of Parthia for Antichus II Theos (261-247 B.C.). This date is fixed by a double-dated tablet 
2 CONC discovered by George Smith (Assyrian Discoveries, London, 1875). The revolt was led by the brothers Arsaces and Tiridates. Arsaces became king and his name the honorific used by all subsequent Parthia
2 CONC n kings.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the second century B.C., the Parthians were able to extend their rule to Bactria, Babylonia, Susiana, and Media, and under Mithradates II (c. 123 - 88 B.C.), Parthian conquests stretched fro
2 CONC m Armenia to India. After the victories of Mithradates II, the Parthians began to claim descent from both the Greeks and the Achaemenids. They spoke a language similar to that of the Achaemenids, used
2 CONC  the Pahlavi script, and established an administrative system based on Achaemenid precedents.

2 CONT <p>The most confused period of Parthian history is from the late years in the reign of Mithradates II (ended c. 88 B.C.) to the establishment of the sole rule of Orodes II c. 57 B.C. While Mithradates
2 CONC  II was still in power, we have coins from Gotarzes I (c. 95 - 90 B.C.), Orodes I (c. 90 - 80 B.C.). And during the period immediately following the reign of Mithradates II, we see overlapping coinage
2 CONC s of Orodes I (c. 90 - 80 B.C.), an Unknown King (I) c. 80 B.C., another Unknown King (II) (c. 80 - 70 B.C.), Sinatruces (c. 77 - 70 B.C.), and Darius of Media Atropatene (c. 70 B.C.). Phraates III ap
2 CONC pears to have consolidated control in the years around and following 70 B.C., and Orodes II took firm control c. 57 B.C. See the expanded discussion of this very confused period at the page on The Dar
2 CONC k Age in Parthian History.

2 CONT <p>Roman Contact</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 53 B.C. Crassus and over 40,000 Roman troops were annihilated by the Parthian forces of Orodes II and the peoples from the Mediterranean to the Indus understood the strength of Parthia. But by 4
2 CONC 0 B.C. even Rome had to acknowledge a Parthia whose forces, under the joint command of Pacorus I and Q. Labienus, a Roman, had struck directly into the heart of the Roman East and captured the provinc
2 CONC es of Asia, Pamphylia, Cilicia, and Syria; even as far south as Petra, Parthia's word was law. For two years this vast area, so vital to Roman interests, was under Parthian occupation. Possession of t
2 CONC he Carian and perhaps the Ionian coast by foreigners struck close to home as many Romans were native to that part of the world or did business there. The occupiers were no sooner pushed out by Ventidi
2 CONC us than another Roman army under Anthony was defeated and barely escaped annihilation at Parthian hands. [Debevoise, 208]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The tug of war with Rome on the western border of Parthia continued almost without cease while Parthia had to constantly see to other threats from the north and east. The western border between Rom
2 CONC e's dominions and Parthia gradually stabilized on the banks of the Euphrates, but war was always a threat and though major campaigns by the Romans were seen in A.D. 116, 161, 195, 217 and 232, Parthia
2 CONC  was never conquered.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Decline</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthian landed nobility gained power and influence due to their their military power and increasing rights over the land and its peasants. As these grew, they were sufficient to allow the nobl
2 CONC es to resist then defy the king, refusing to pay levies and failing to answer the call to arms that had been Parthia's source of power. Concurrently, the royal Arsacids fell to internal disagreements 
2 CONC over succession which often ended in murder and a continued slide in their power. The resulting disorganization and fragmentation of the empire made way for successful Roman incursions into Parthian t
2 CONC erritories where rich commercial centers and royal treasuries were plundered, and territories lost to invaders. Petty kings rose to fill the power void;  this power redistribution culminated in a dire
2 CONC ct attempts to overthrow the monarchy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>End of Empire</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In A.D. 224, Ardashir, Parthian governor in the Achaemenid home province of Persis (Fars), overthrew Artabanus IV and established the Sasanid dynasty. The last Parthian king, Vologases VI, issued h
2 CONC is last dated coin in A.D. 228.  The Sasanians would rule Iran until the Islamic conquest in A.D. 641. The Sasanians were ardent Zoroastrians in conflict with their Armenian subjects who originally we
2 CONC re Zoroastrians but subsequently embraced Christianity. The years of Sasanid rule saw a continuation of the struggle between Persia and Rome begun in the Parthian period. References to Parthia by Roma
2 CONC ns after A.D. 228 are to the Sasanid empire.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Me'dia. (middle land). Me'dia lay northwest of Persia proper, south and southwest of the Caspian Sea, east of Armenia and Assyria, west and northwest of the great salt desert of Iran. Its greatest 
2 CONC length was from north to south, and in this direction, it extended from the 32d to the 40th parallel, a distance of 550 miles. In width, it reached front about long. 45 degrees to 53 degrees; but its 
2 CONC average breadth was not more than from 250 to 300 miles. The division of Media commonly recognized by the Greeks and Romans was that into Media Magna and Media Atropatene.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>1. Media Atropatene corresponded nearly to the modern Azerbijan, being the tract situated between the Caspian and the mountains which run north from Zagros.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>2. Media Magna lay south and east of Atropatene. It contained great part of Kurdistan and Luristan, with all Ardelan and Arak Ajemi. It is indicative of the division that there were two Ecbatanas, 
2 CONC respectively the capitals of the two districts.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Medes were a nation of very high antiquity; we find a notice of them in the primitive Babylonian history of Berosus, who says that the Medes conquered Babylon at a very remote period, (circa, B
2 CONC .C. 2458), and that eight Median monarchs reigned there consecutively, over a space of 224 years. The deepest obscurity hangs, however, over the whole history of the Medes from the time of their beari
2 CONC ng sway in Babylonia, B.C. 2458-2234, to their first appearance in the cuneiform inscriptions among the enemies of Assyria, about B.C. 880.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Near the middle of the seventh century B.C., the Median kingdom was consolidated, and became formidable to its neighbors; but previous to this time, it was not under the dominion of a single powerf
2 CONC ul monarch, but was ruled by a vast number of petty chieftains. Cyaxares, the third Median monarch, took Nineveh and conquered Assyria, B.C. 625.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The limits of the Median empire cannot be definitely fixed. From north to south it was certainly confined between the Persian Gulf and the Euphrates on the one side, the Black and Caspian Seas on t
2 CONC he other. From east to west it had, however, a wide expansion, since it reached from the Halys at least as far as the Caspian Gates, and possible farther. It was separated from Babylonia either by the
2 CONC  Tigris or more probably by a line running about halfway between that river and the Euphrates. Its greatest length may be reckoned at 1500 miles from northwest to southeast, and its average breadth at
2 CONC  400 or 450 miles. Its area would thus be about 600,000 square miles, or somewhat greater than that of modern Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Of all the ancient Oriental monarchies, the Median was the shortest in duration. It was overthrown by the Persians under Cyrus, B.C. 558, who captured its king, Astyages. The treatment of the Medes
2 CONC , by the victorious Persians, was not that of an ordinary conquered nation. Medes were appointed to stations of high honor and importance under Cyrus and his successors. The two nations seem blended i
2 CONC nto one, and we often find reference to this kingdom as that of the "Medes and Persians." Dan_5:28; Dan_6:8; Dan_6:12; Dan_6:15.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The references to the Medes, in the canonical Scriptures, are not very numerous, but they are striking. We first hear of certain "cities of the Medes," in which the captive Israelites were placed b
2 CONC y "the king of Assyria", on the destruction of Samaria, B.C. 721. 2Ki_17:6; 2Ki_18:12.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Soon afterward, Isaiah prophesies the part which the Medes shall take in the destruction of Babylon, Isa_13:17; Isa_21:2, which is again still more distinctly declared by Jeremiah, Jer_51:11; Jer_5
2 CONC 1:28, who sufficiently indicates, the independence of Media in his day. Jer_25:25.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Daniel relates the fact of the Medo-Persia conquest, Dan_5:25; Dan_5:31, giving an account of the reign of Darius, the Mede, who appears to have been made viceroy by Cyrus. Dan_6:1-58. In Ezra, we 
2 CONC have a mention of Achmetha, (Ecbatana), "the palace in the province of the Medes," where the decree of Cyrus was found, Ezr_6:2-5, -- a notice which accords, with the known facts that the Median capit
2 CONC al was the seat of government under Cyrus, but a royal residence only, and not the seat of government, under Darius Hystaspis. Finally, in Esther, the high rank of Media, under the Persian kings, yet 
2 CONC at the same time, its subordinate position, is marked by the frequent composition, of the two names in phrases of honor, the precedence being in every case assigned to the Persians.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius II was a man of Median, Armenian and Greek descent. He was the second son and among the children born to Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene and his wife, Athenais. He was born and raised in Me

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Marriage'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius II from c. 15 BC to 10 BC married an unnamed Arsacid Parthian Princess, who was a relation to the King Vonones I of Parthia. Darius II is the third Seleucid descendant and the only known mal

2 CONT <p>was the 1st-century king of Iberia (Kartli, modern eastern Georgia) whose reign is evidenced by epigraphic material. Cyril Toumanoff suggests as A.D. 58-106 as the years of his reign.
2 CONT <p>Two inscriptions unearthed at Armazi, Georgia, – one bilingual in Aramaic and Greek, and the other in Greek – identifies Mithridates (Mirdat) as the son of the "great king" Pharsamanes (P'arsma
2 CONC n), apparently the Pharasmanes of Iberia of Tacitus’s Annals. The stone inscription in Greek speaks of Mithridates as "the friend of the Caesars" and the king "of the Roman-loving Iberians." It also
2 CONC  reports that the Roman emperor Vespasian fortified Armazi for the Iberian king in 75.[1]
2 CONT <p>Mithridates is ignored by the medieval Georgian chronicles which, instead, report a joint rule of Kartam (Kardzam) and Bartom (Bratman) – in the time when Vespasian’s destruction of Jerusalem i
2 CONC n 70 spurred a wave of the refugee Jews to Iberia – and then of their sons – Parsman and Kaos – and grandsons – Azork and Armazel.[2] Several moderns scholars, such as Cyril Toumanoff, conside
2 CONC r the Iberian diarchy a pure legend and a "deformed memory of the historical reign of Mithridates I".[3] Of these royal pairs, Professor Giorgi Melikishvili identifies "Azork" as Mithridates’s possi
2 CONC ble local name and "Armazel" as a territorial epithet, meaning in Georgian "of Armazi."[4]
2 CONT <p>There is another Greek inscription – found in Rome – an epitaph for Amazaspus, who is named as brother of King Mithridates of Iberia. The inscription records Amazapus’s death at Nisibis, whil
2 CONC e accompanying the emperor Trajan on his Parthian campaign of 114-117.[5]

2 CONT <p>Parthia  was a civilization situated in the northeast of modern Iran, but at its height covering all of Iran proper, as well as regions of the modern countries of Armenia, Iraq, Georgia, eastern Tu

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia was led by the Arsacid dynasty, who reunited and ruled over the Iranian plateau, taking over the eastern provinces of the Greek Seleucid Empire, beginning in the late 3rd century BC, and in
2 CONC termittently controlled Mesopotamia between ca 150 BC and 224 AD. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the Median and the Achaemenid dynasties). Parthia (mostly due to their inventio
2 CONC n of heavy cavalry) was the arch-enemy of the Roman Empire in the east; and it limited Rome's expansion beyond Cappadocia (central Anatolia).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Scythian-Parni nomads (Assyrians called them Ashkuz) had settled in Parthia and had built a small independent kingdom, they rose to power under king Mithridates the Great (171–138 BC). 
2 CONC Later, at the height of their power, Parthian influence reached as far as Ubar in Arabia, the nexus of the frankincense trade route, where Parthian-inspired ceramics have been found. The power of the 
2 CONC early Parthian empire seems to have been overestimated by some ancient historians, who could not clearly separate the powerful later empire from its more humble obscure origins. The end of this long-l
2 CONC ived empire came in 224 AD, when the empire was loosely organized and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassals, the Persians of the Sassanid dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Little is known of the Parthians; not much of their own literature has survived. Consequently Parthian history is largely derived from foreign histories, controlled by the evidence of coins and ins
2 CONC criptions; even their own name for themselves is debatable due to a lack of domestic records. Several Greek authors, of whom we have fragments, including Apollodorus of Artemita and Isidore of Charax,
2 CONC  wrote under Parthian rule. Their power was based on a combination of the guerilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organisational skills sufficient to build and administer a vast empire - eve
2 CONC n though it never matched in power the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. Vassal kingdoms seem to have made up a large part of their territory (see Tigranes II of Armenia), and Hellenistic
2 CONC  cities enjoyed a certain autonomy; their craftsmen received employment by some Parthians.

2 CONT <p> Parthia as a satrapy</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia originally designated a territory southeast of the Caspian sea. It was a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire, which was conquered by Alexander the Great circa 330 BCE. Following Alexander's de
2 CONC ath, the government of Parthia was given to Nicanor, at the Partition of Babylon in 323 BCE. At the Partition of Triparadisus in 320 BCE, Parthia was given to Philip. Philip was then succeeded by Peit
2 CONC hon. From 311 BCE Parthia then became a part of the Seleucid empire, being ruled by various satraps under a Seleucid king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Andragoras (?-238 BCE) was the last Seleucid satrap of the province of "Partahia", under the Seleucid rulers Antiochus I Soter and Antiochus II Theos (Justin, xli. 4). Andragoras tried to wrestle i
2 CONC ndependence from the Seleucid Empire, at a time when the Seleucid were embroiled in conflict with Ptolemaic Egypt. In defiance, he issued coins in which he wears the royal diadem as well as his name (
2 CONC Will: I, 1966). Andragoras was a neighbour, a contemporary, and probably an ally of Diodotus I in Bactria, who also wrestled independence around the same time, giving rise to the Greco-Bactrian kingdo
2 CONC m.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p> The Parthian Empire</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The tribe of the Parni, a nomadic people of Iranian origin, who originally spoke an Eastern Iranian language and later known as the Parthians, entered the Iranian plateau from Central Asia. They we
2 CONC re consummate horsemen, known for the 'Parthian shot': turning backwards at full gallop to loose an arrow directly to the rear. Initially, ca. 238 BCE, their king named Arsaces (Ashk) toppled Andragor
2 CONC as and established his dynasty's independence from Seleucid rule in remote areas of northern Iran in what is today known as Turkmenistan.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"He (Arsaces) was used to a life of pillage and theft, when he heard about the defeat of Seleucus against the Gauls. Relieved from his fear of the king, he attacked the Parthians with a band of thi
2 CONC eves, vanquished their prefect Andragoras, and, after having killed him took the power over the nation" Justin, xli. 4.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The descendants of Arsaces ruled until Antiochus III the Great invaded Parthia in 209 BC, occupied the capital Hecatompylus and pushed forward into Hyrcania. The Parthian king Arsaces II apparently
2 CONC  successfully sued for peace, and Parthia recognized Seleucid authority. Antiochus III had so well secured Parthia that he moved further east into Bactria, where he fought the Greco-Bactrian king Euth
2 CONC ydemus I for three years, and then went into India.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It was not until the 2nd century BC that the Parthians were able to profit from the continuing erosion of the Seleucid Empire, gradually capturing all its territories east of Syria. Once the Parthi
2 CONC ans had gained Herat, the movement of trade along the Silk Road to China was effectively choked off and the post-Alexandrian Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was doomed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Seleucid monarchs attempted to "hold the line" against the Parthian expansion; Antiochus IV Epiphanes spent his last years on a campaign against the newly emerging Iranian states. After his dea
2 CONC th in 164 BC, the Parthians took advantage of the ensuing dynastic squabbles to make even greater gains.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>.In 139 BC, the Parthian king Mithridates I captured the Seleucid monarch Demetrius II Nicator, holding him captive for ten years while his troops overwhelmed Mesopotamia and Media.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By 129 BC the Parthians were in control of all the lands right to the Tigris, and established their winter encampment on its banks at Ctesiphon, downstream from modern Baghdad. Ctesiphon was then a
2 CONC  small suburb directly across the river from Seleucia on the Tigris, the most Hellenistic city of western Asia. Because of their need of the wealth and trade provided by Seleucia, the Parthian armies 
2 CONC limited their incursions to harassment, allowing the city to preserve its independence. In the heat of the Mesopotamian summer, the Parthian army would withdraw to the ancient Persian capitals of Susa
2 CONC  and Ecbatana (modern Hamadan).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From around 130 BCE, the Parthians suffered numerous incursions by Scythian nomads (also called the Tocharians from Bactria, possibly the Yuezhi), in which kings Phraates II and Artabanus I were su
2 CONC ccessively killed. Scythians again invaded Parthia around 90 BCE, putting king Sanatruces on the Parthian throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Government</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the conquest of Media, Assyria, Babylonia and Elam, the Parthians had to organize their empire. The former elites of these countries were Greek, and the new rulers had to adapt to their custo
2 CONC ms if they wanted their rule to last. As a result, the cities retained their ancient rights and civil administrations remained more or less undisturbed. An interesting detail is coinage: legends were 
2 CONC written in the Greek alphabet, a practice that continued until the 2nd century AD, when local knowledge of the language was in decline and few people knew how to read or write the Greek alphabet.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Another source of inspiration was the Achaemenid dynasty that had once ruled the Persian Empire. Courtiers spoke Persian and used the Pahlavi script; the royal court traveled from capital to capita
2 CONC l, and the Arsacid kings styled themselves "king of kings". It was an apt title, as in addition to his own kingdom the Parthian monarch was the overlord of some eighteen vassal kings, such as the rule
2 CONC rs of the city state Hatra, the kingdom of Characene and the ancient kingdom of Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The empire was, overall, not very centralized. There were several languages, many peoples, and a number of different economic systems. The loose ties between the separate parts of the empire were a
2 CONC  key to its survival. In the 2nd century AD, the most important capital, Ctesiphon, was captured no less than three times by the Romans (in 116, 165 and 198 AD), but the empire survived because there 
2 CONC were other centers of power. On the other hand, the fact that the empire was a mere conglomeratation of kingdoms, provinces and city-states did at times seriously weaken the Parthian state. This was a
2 CONC  major factor in the halt of the Parthian expansion after the conquests of Mesopotamia and Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Local potentates played important roles, and the king had to respect their privileges. Several noble families had votes in the Royal council; the Suren-Pahlav Clan had the right to crown the Parthi
2 CONC an king, and every aristocrat was allowed and expected to retain an army of his own. When the throne was occupied by a weak ruler, divisions among the nobility became dangerous.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The constituent parts of the empire were surprisingly independent. For example, they were allowed to strike their own coins, a privilege which in antiquity was very rare. As long as the local elite
2 CONC  paid tribute to the Parthian king, there was little interference. The system worked well: towns like Ctesiphon, Seleucia, Ecbatana, Rhagae, Hecatompylos, Nisâ, and Susa flourished.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tribute was one source of royal income; another was tolls. Parthia controlled the Silk Road, the trade route between the Mediterranean Sea and China.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian language</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian is a now-extinct ancient Northwestern Iranian language that originated in Parthia (a region in north-east of modern Iran and the Greater Khorasan, including southern part of what is today 
2 CONC known as Turkmenistan) and was the official language of the Parthian Empire under the Arsacid Dynasty (248 BC - 224 AD).

2 CONT <p> Contact with China</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Chinese explorer Zhang Qian, who visited the neighbouring countries of Bactria and Sogdiana in 126 BC, made the first known Chinese report on Parthia. In his accounts Parthia is named "?nx?" (C
2 CONC hinese: ??), a transliteration of "Arsacid", the name of the Parthian dynasty. Zhang Qian clearly identifies Parthia as an advanced urban civilization, which he equates to those of Dayuan (in Ferghana
2 CONC ) and Daxia (in Bactria).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"Anxi is situated several thousand li west of the region of the Great Yuezhi (in Transoxonia). The people are settled on the land, cultivating the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make 
2 CONC wine out of grapes. They have walled cities like the people of Dayuan (Ferghana), the region contains several hundred cities of various sizes. The coins of the country are made of silver and bear the 
2 CONC face of the king. When the king dies, the currency is immediately changed and new coins issued with the face of his successor. The people keep records by writing on horizontal strips of leather. To th
2 CONC e west lies Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) and to the north Yancai and Lixuan (Hyrcania)." (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Following Zhang Qian's embassy and report, commercial relations between China, Central Asia, and Parthia flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the 1st century BC: "The largest o
2 CONC f these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten partie
2 CONC s would be sent out." (Shiji, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthians were apparently very intent on maintaining good relations with China and also sent their own embassies, starting around 110 BC: "When the Han envoy first visited the kingdom of Anxi (
2 CONC Parthia), the king of Anxi dispatched a party of 20,000 horsemen to meet them on the eastern border of the kingdom... When the Han envoys set out again to return to China, the king of Anxi dispatched 
2 CONC envoys of his own to accompany them... The emperor was delighted at this." (Shiji, 123, trans. Burton Watson).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 97 the Chinese general Ban Chao went as far west as the Caspian Sea with 70,000 men and established direct military contacts with the Parthian Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthians also played a role in the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism from Central Asia to China. An Shih Kao, a Parthian nobleman and Buddhist missionary, went to the Chinese capital Luoyang in 1
2 CONC 48 where he established temples and became the first man to translate Buddhist scriptures into Chinese.

2 CONT <p>Main article: Roman relations with the Parthians and Sassanians</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>.In 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus invaded Parthia, but was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae by a Parthian commander called Surena in the Greek and Latin sources, most likely a member of the Sur
2 CONC en-Pahlav Clan. This was the beginning of a series of wars that were to last for almost three centuries.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthian armies included two types of cavalry: the heavily-armed and armoured cataphracts and lightly armed but highly-mobile mounted archers. For the Romans, who relied on heavy infantry, the 
2 CONC Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they w
2 CONC ere unskilled in siege warfare. Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able to completely defeat each other.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the years following the battle of Carrhae the Romans were divided in civil war between the adherents of Pompey and those of Julius Caesar and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Although C
2 CONC aesar was eventually victorious against Pompey and was planning a campaign against Parthia, his subsequent murder led to another civil war. The Roman general Quintus Labienus, who had supported Caesar
2 CONC 's murderers and feared reprisals from his heirs, Mark Antony and Octavian (later Augustus), sided with the Parthians and eventually became the best general of king Pacorus I. In 41 BC Parthia, led by
2 CONC  Labienus, invaded Syria, Cilicia, and Caria and attacked Phrygia in Asia Minor. A second army intervened in Judaea and captured its king Hyrcanus II. The spoils were immense, and put to good use: Kin
2 CONC g Phraates IV invested them in building up Ctesiphon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 39 BC, Antony retaliated, sending out the old warhorse general Publius Ventidius Bassus and several of Caesar's crack, veteran legions to secure the conquered territories. The Parthian King Paco
2 CONC rus was killed along with Labienus, and the Euphrates again became the border between the two nations. Hoping to further avenge the death of Crassus, Antony invaded Mesopotamia in 36 BC with the Legio
2 CONC n VI Ferrata and other units. Having cavalry in support, Antony reached Armenia but ceased his advance as civil war again broke out in Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony's campaign was followed by a break in the fighting between the two empires as Rome was again embroiled in civil war. When Octavian defeated Mark Antony, he ignored the Parthians, being more 
2 CONC interested in the west. His son-in-law and future successor Tiberius negotiated a peace treaty with Phraates (20 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the same time, around the year 1, the Parthians became interested in the valley of the Indus, where they began conquering the petty kingdoms of Gandhara. One of the Parthian leaders was Gondopha
2 CONC res, king of Taxila; according to an old and widespread Christian tradition, he was baptized by the apostle Thomas. While it may sound far-fetched, the story is not altogether impossible: adherents of
2 CONC  several religions lived together in Gandara and the Punjab, and there may have been an audience for a representative of a new Jewish sect.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>War broke out again between Rome and Parthia in the 60s. Armenia had become a Roman vassal kingdom, but the Parthian king Vologases I appointed a new Armenian ruler. This was too much for the Roman
2 CONC s, and their commander Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo invaded Armenia. The result was that the Armenian king received his crown again in Rome from the emperor Nero. A compromise was worked out between the tw
2 CONC o empires: in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Also during the 1st century BC, the Parthians started to make inroads into eastern territories that had been occupied by the Indo-Scythians and the Yuezhi. The Parthians gained control of parts of 
2 CONC Bactria and extensive South Asian territories in modern day Pakistan, after defeating local rulers such as the Kushan Empire ruler Kujula Kadphises, in the Gandhara region.

2 CONT <p>The ruins of the ancient port city of Siraf are in the process of excavation, and its historical importance to ancient trade is only now being realized. Discovered there in archaeological excavatio
2 CONC ns are ivory objects from east Africa, pieces of stone from India, and lapis from Afghanistan. Sirif dates back to the Parthian era.[3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Around 20 AD, Gondophares, one of the Parthian conquerors, declared his independence from the Parthian empire and established the Indo-Parthian Kingdom in the conquered territories.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p> Decline and fall</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Armenian compromise served its purpose, but nothing in it covered the deposition of an Armenian king. After 110 AD, the Parthian king Vologases III dethroned the Armenian ruler, and the Roman e
2 CONC mperor Trajan decided to invade Parthia in retaliation. War broke out in 114 AD and the Parthians were severely beaten. The Romans conquered Armenia, and in the following year, Trajan marched to the s
2 CONC outh, where the Parthians were forced to evacuate their strongholds. In 116 AD, Trajan captured Ctesiphon, and established new provinces in Assyria and Babylonia. Later that year he took the Parthian 
2 CONC capital, Susa, deposed the Parthian King Osroes I and put Parthamaspates as a puppet ruler on the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Rebellions soon broke out due to the continuing loyalty of the population to Parthia. At the same time, the diasporic Jews revolted and Trajan was forced to send an army to suppress them. Trajan ov
2 CONC ercame these troubles, but his successor Hadrian gave up the territories (117 AD).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian weaknesses also contributed to the disaster. In the first century AD, the Parthian nobility had become more powerful due to concessions by the Parthian king granting them greater powers ov
2 CONC er the land and the peasantry. Their power now rivaled the king's, while at the same time internal divisions in the Arsacid family had rendered them vulnerable.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But the end was not near, yet. In 161 AD king Vologases IV declared war against the Romans and reconquered Armenia. The Roman counter-offensive was slow, but in 165 AD, Ctesiphon fell, and the Part
2 CONC hians were only saved by the outburst of a catastrophic epidemic (probably the measles) which temporarily crippled the two empires. The Roman emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius added northern M
2 CONC esopotamia to their realm (partly as a vassal-kingdom), but as it was never secure enough for them to demilitarize the region between the Euphrates and Tigris. It remained an expensive burden.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The deciding blow came thirty years later. King Vologases V had tried to reconquer Mesopotamia during another Roman civil war (193 AD), but was repulsed when general Septimius Severus counter-attac
2 CONC ked. Again, Ctesiphon was captured (198 AD), and large spoils were brought to Rome. According to a modern estimate, the gold and silver were sufficient to postpone a European economic crisis for three
2 CONC  or four decades, and the consequences of the looting for Parthia were dire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthia, now impoverished and without any hope to recover the lost territories, was demoralized. The kings were forced to concede greater powers to the nobility, and the vassal kings began to waver
2 CONC  in their allegiance. In 224 AD, the Persian vassal king Ardašir revolted. Two years later, he took Ctesiphon, and this time it meant the end of Parthia, replaced by a third Persian Empire, ruled by 
2 CONC the Sassanid dynasty.

2 CONT <p>Overview of Parthian History</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prelude</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There was a district named Partukka or Partakka which was known to the Assyrians as early as the seventh century B.C., and it may have formed a part of Media. Media was conquered by Cyrus (Kurush) 
2 CONC the Great, founder of the Achaemenid empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Achaemenids ruled Iran from 550 B.C. to 330 B.C. and their authority extended from the Danube river to the Indus river at its zenith. Under the Achaemenids, there was a satrapy named Parthava, 
2 CONC probably gained by conquest between 546 and 539 B.C. during Cyrus the Great's campaign south and east of the Caspian Sea. (Debevoise, Political History, 4) At that time the satrapy included Hyrcania, 
2 CONC which lay between the Elburz mountains and the Caspian Sea. Parthava revolted in 521 B.C., but was subdued and probably remained united with Hyrcania at the death of Darius. Later it was apparently se
2 CONC parated from Hyrcania and then joined with Chorasmia. In the army of Xerxes, there was a contingent of Parthians under the command of a certain Artabazus son of Pharnaces, probably the satrap of Parth
2 CONC ia. Among the Parthians killed in Xerxes' Greek campaign was a cavalry leader named Arsaces. (Aeschylus, Persae, 4) The last ruler of the Achaemenid line was Darius III Condomannus who was defeated by
2 CONC  Alexander the Great. The Parthians fought on the side of the Achaemenids against Alexander at Arbela and Darius' satrap of Parthia, Phrataphernes, surrendered to Alexander in Hyrcania. (Arrian, Anaba
2 CONC sis, iii)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After defeat by Alexander, Amminapses, a Parthian from Egypt, was made Alexander's satrap of Parthia, which had been joined with Hyrcania. In 318 B.C. Pithon, satrap of Media, seized Parthia and in
2 CONC stalled his brother Eudamus. But other satraps became alarmed and united under Peucestas of Persis to drive Pithon back to Media. (Justin xiii, 4. 23) After 316 B.C. the province was apparently joined
2 CONC  to Bactria under the command of Stasanor. But after nearly a century of Macedonian Greek rule by Alexander and his Seleucid successors, the nearly continuous war with Egypt weakened the Seleucids to 
2 CONC the point that Diodotus of Bactria revolted and declared himself king circa 253 B.C. (Justin xli, 4. 5)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Early History</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The origins of the Parthian people are clouded. Strabo (xi, 515) says the first Arsaces was a Scythian man with the semi-nomadic Parni tribe, a part of the Dahi, nomads who lived along the Ochus (T
2 CONC ejend or lower Oxus) River, who invaded and conquered Parthia. Strabo also mentions those who claim Arsaces was a Bactrian who escaped from Diodotus after a failed revolt. Justin (xli, 1) agrees Arsac
2 CONC es was a Scythian. Frye's analysis is that we can believe the Parni origins, but it was more likely a migration than an invasion that brought them, and Arsaces, to Parthia. (History, p. 207) These peo
2 CONC ple would not be known as Parthians until they moved southward into the Persian province of Parthava sometime before 250 B.C. Achaemenian and early Greek references to "Parthians" refer to earlier inh
2 CONC abitants of Parthava, not the Arsacid Parthians. (Debevoise, Political History, 2; W. M. Montgomery, Early Empires).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthians took encouragement from Diodotus' success and in 247 B.C. rose against Andragoras, satrap of Parthia for Antichus II Theos (261-247 B.C.). This date is fixed by a double-dated tablet 
2 CONC discovered by George Smith (Assyrian Discoveries, London, 1875). The revolt was led by the brothers Arsaces and Tiridates. Arsaces became king and his name the honorific used by all subsequent Parthia
2 CONC n kings.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the second century B.C., the Parthians were able to extend their rule to Bactria, Babylonia, Susiana, and Media, and under Mithradates II (c. 123 - 88 B.C.), Parthian conquests stretched fro
2 CONC m Armenia to India. After the victories of Mithradates II, the Parthians began to claim descent from both the Greeks and the Achaemenids. They spoke a language similar to that of the Achaemenids, used
2 CONC  the Pahlavi script, and established an administrative system based on Achaemenid precedents.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Parthian "Dark Age" c. 95 - 57 B.C.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most confused period of Parthian history is from the late years in the reign of Mithradates II (ended c. 88 B.C.) to the establishment of the sole rule of Orodes II c. 57 B.C. While Mithradates
2 CONC  II was still in power, we have coins from Gotarzes I (c. 95 - 90 B.C.), Orodes I (c. 90 - 80 B.C.). And during the period immediately following the reign of Mithradates II, we see overlapping coinage
2 CONC s of Orodes I (c. 90 - 80 B.C.), an Unknown King (I) c. 80 B.C., another Unknown King (II) (c. 80 - 70 B.C.), Sinatruces (c. 77 - 70 B.C.), and Darius of Media Atropatene (c. 70 B.C.). Phraates III ap
2 CONC pears to have consolidated control in the years around and following 70 B.C., and Orodes II took firm control c. 57 B.C. See the expanded discussion of this very confused period at the page on The Dar
2 CONC k Age in Parthian History.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Roman Contact</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 53 B.C. Crassus and over 40,000 Roman troops were annihilated by the Parthian forces of Orodes II and the peoples from the Mediterranean to the Indus understood the strength of Parthia. But by 4
2 CONC 0 B.C. even Rome had to acknowledge a Parthia whose forces, under the joint command of Pacorus I and Q. Labienus, a Roman, had struck directly into the heart of the Roman East and captured the provinc
2 CONC es of Asia, Pamphylia, Cilicia, and Syria; even as far south as Petra, Parthia's word was law. For two years this vast area, so vital to Roman interests, was under Parthian occupation. Possession of t
2 CONC he Carian and perhaps the Ionian coast by foreigners struck close to home as many Romans were native to that part of the world or did business there. The occupiers were no sooner pushed out by Ventidi
2 CONC us than another Roman army under Anthony was defeated and barely escaped annihilation at Parthian hands. [Debevoise, 208]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The tug of war with Rome on the western border of Parthia continued almost without cease while Parthia had to constantly see to other threats from the north and east. The western border between Rom
2 CONC e's dominions and Parthia gradually stabilized on the banks of the Euphrates, but war was always a threat and though major campaigns by the Romans were seen in A.D. 116, 161, 195, 217 and 232, Parthia
2 CONC  was never conquered.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Decline</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Parthian landed nobility gained power and influence due to their their military power and increasing rights over the land and its peasants. As these grew, they were sufficient to allow the nobl
2 CONC es to resist then defy the king, refusing to pay levies and failing to answer the call to arms that had been Parthia's source of power. Concurrently, the royal Arsacids fell to internal disagreements 
2 CONC over succession which often ended in murder and a continued slide in their power. The resulting disorganization and fragmentation of the empire made way for successful Roman incursions into Parthian t
2 CONC erritories where rich commercial centers and royal treasuries were plundered, and territories lost to invaders. Petty kings rose to fill the power void;  this power redistribution culminated in a dire
2 CONC ct attempts to overthrow the monarchy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>End of Empire</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In A.D. 224, Ardashir, Parthian governor in the Achaemenid home province of Persis (Fars), overthrew Artabanus IV and established the Sasanid dynasty. The last Parthian king, Vologases VI, issued h
2 CONC is last dated coin in A.D. 228.  The Sasanians would rule Iran until the Islamic conquest in A.D. 641. The Sasanians were ardent Zoroastrians in conflict with their Armenian subjects who originally we
2 CONC re Zoroastrians but subsequently embraced Christianity. The years of Sasanid rule saw a continuation of the struggle between Persia and Rome begun in the Parthian period. References to Parthia by Roma
2 CONC ns after A.D. 228 are to the Sasanid empire.

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases I of Parthia (Persian: ولاش يکم‎‎) sometimes called Vologaeses or Vologeses or following Parthian usage, Walagash (Persian: بلاش‎‎ Balāsh) was king of the Parthian Emp
2 CONC ire from about 51 until his death in 78.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family and ascension'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases I was a Prince of Iranian and Greek ancestry. He was one of the sons born to Vonones II from a Greek concubine, he succeeded his father in 51. When he ascended the Parthian throne, he app
2 CONC ointed his brother Pacorus II as king of Atropatene.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Invasion of Armenia'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 52, Vologases I invaded Armenia, conquering Artaxata (Artashat in Armenia) and proclaiming his younger brother Tiridates I as king. This action violated the treaty that had been signed by the Ro
2 CONC man emperor Augustus and Parthian king Phraates IV which gave the Romans the explicit right to appoint and crown the kings of Armenia. Vologases I considered the throne of Armenia to have been once th
2 CONC e property of his ancestors, now usurped by a foreign monarch in virtue of a crime. A winter epidemic as well as an insurrection initiated by his son Vardanes forced him to withdraw his troops from Ar
2 CONC menia, allowing Rhadamistus to come back and punish locals as traitors; they eventually revolted and replaced him with the Parthian prince Tiridates I in early 55. Rhadamistus escaped along with his w
2 CONC ife Zenobia who was pregnant. Unable to continue fleeing, she asked her husband to end her life rather than be captured. Rhadamistus stabbed her with a Median dagger and flung her body into the river 
2 CONC Araxes. Zenobia was not fatally injured and was recovered by shepherds who sent her to Tiridates. Tiridates I received her kindly and treated her as a member of the monarchy. Rhadamistus himself retur
2 CONC ned to Iberia and was soon put to death by his father Parasmanes I of Iberia for having plotted against the royal power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''War with Rome'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Unhappy with the growing Parthian influence at their doorstep, Roman Emperor Nero sent General Corbulo with a large army to the east in order to restore Roman client kings. A Hasmonean named Aristo
2 CONC bulus was given Lesser Armenia (Nicopolis and Satala) and Sohaemus of Emesa received Armenia Sophene. In the spring of 58, Corbulo entered Greater Armenia from Cappadocia and advanced towards Artaxata
2 CONC , while Parasmanes I of Iberia attacked from the north, and Antiochus IV of Commagene attacked from the southwest. Supported by his brother, Tiridates I sent flying columns to raid the Romans far and 
2 CONC wide. Corbulo retaliated using the same tactics and the use of the Moschoi tribes who raided outlying regions of Armenia. Tiridates I fled from the capital, and Corbulo burned Artaxata to the ground. 
2 CONC In the summer, Corbulo began moving towards Tigranocerta through rough terrain and passing through the Taronitida (Taron), where several of his commanders died in an ambush by the Armenian resistance;
2 CONC  however, the city opened its doors, with the exception of one of the citadels, which was destroyed in the ensuing assault. By this time the majority of Armenians had abandoned resistance and accepted
2 CONC  the prince favored by Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nero gave the crown to the last royal descendant of the Kings of Cappadocia, the grandson of Glaphyra (daughter of Archelaus of Cappadocia) and Alexander of Judea (the brother of Herod Archelaus an
2 CONC d the son of Herod the Great), who assumed the Armenian name Tigranes (his uncle was Tigranes V). His son, named Gaius Julius Alexander, married Iotapa, the daughter of Antiochus IV of Commagene and w
2 CONC as made King of Cilicia. Nero was hailed vigorously in public for this initial victory and Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward. A guard of 1000 legionary soldiers, three auxiliary coho
2 CONC rts and two wings of horses were allotted to Tigranes in order to defend the country. Border districts were bestowed to Roman allies that assisted Corbulo including Polemon, Parasmanes, Aristobolus an
2 CONC d Antiochus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases I was infuriated by the fact that an alien now sat on the Armenian throne but hesitated to reinstate his brother as he was engaged in a conflict with the Hyrcanians who were revolting. Ti
2 CONC granes invaded the Kingdom of Adiabene and deposed its King Monobazes in 61, who was a vassal of Parthians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases I considered this an act of aggression from Rome and started a campaign to restore Tiridates I to the Armenian throne. He placed under the command of spahbed Moneses a well-disciplined fo
2 CONC rce of cataphracts along with Adiabenian auxiliaries and ordered him to expel Tigranes from Armenia. Having quelled the Hyrcanian revolt, Vologases I gathered the strength of his dominions and embarke
2 CONC d toward Armenia. Corbulo, having been informed of the impending attack, sent two legions under the commands of Verulanus Severus and Vettius Bolanus to the assistance of Tigranes with secret directio
2 CONC ns that they should act with caution rather than vigour. He also dispatched a message to Nero, urging him to send a second commander with the explicit purpose of defending Armenia as Syria was now als
2 CONC o in peril. Corbulo placed the remainder of the legions on the banks of the Euphrates and armed irregular troops of the nearby provinces. Since the region was deficient in water, he erected forts over
2 CONC  the fountains and concealed the rivulets by heaping sand over them.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Moneses marched towards Tigranocerta but failed to break the defense of the city walls as his troops were unfit for a long siege. Corbulo, although eminently successful thought it prudent to use hi
2 CONC s good fortune with moderation. He sent a Roman centurion by the name of Casperius to the camp of Vologases I in Nisibis located 37 miles (60 km) from Tigranocerta with the demand to raise the siege. 
2 CONC Because of a recent locust storm and the scarcity of fodder for his horses Vologases I agreed to raise the siege of Tigranocerta and petitioned to be granted Armenia in order to achieve a firm peace. 
2 CONC Vologases I demanded that both the Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate Armenia, that Tigranes should be dethroned, and that the position of Tiridates I be recognized. The Roman government declin
2 CONC ed to accede to these arrangements and sent Lucius Caesennius Paetus, governor of Cappadocia, to settle the question by bringing Armenia under direct Roman administration.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Paetus was an incapable commander and suffered a humiliating defeat at the Battle of Rhandeia in 62, losing the legions of XII Fulminata commanded by Calvisius Sabinus and IIII Scythica commanded b
2 CONC y Funisulanus Vettonianus. The command of the troops was returned to Corbulo, who the following year led a strong army into Melitene and beyond into Armenia, eliminating all of the regional governors 
2 CONC he suspected were pro-Parthian. Finally in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates I met to make a peace agreement. The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates I and Corbulo. It appealed to Tiridates I bec
2 CONC ause that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; on the other hand, it appealed to Corbulo because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in th
2 CONC e same location. When Tiridates I arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero, agreeing to receive it back only from Nero in Rome. Tiridate
2 CONC s I was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently, in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed. Corbulo left his son-in-law Annius Vinicia
2 CONC nus to accompany Tiridates I to Rome in order to attest his own fidelity to Nero.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Tiridates' visit in Rome, Nero summoned Vologases I to Rome several times, but when the invitations became burdensome to Vologases I, he sent back a dispatch to this effect: "It is far easier
2 CONC  for you than for me to traverse so great a body of water. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange to meet each other."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Later life and death'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, Vologases I was still satisfied with this result and honored the memory of Nero, though he stood in good relations with Vespasian also, to whom he offered an army of 40,000 archers in the 
2 CONC war against Vitellius. Soon afterwards the Alans, a great nomadic tribe beyond the Caucasus, invaded Atropatene and Armenia; Vologases I applied in vain for help to Vespasian, but did not achieve any 
2 CONC decisive result. The Alans quickly withdrew with a lot of booty after plundering Armenia and Media Atropatene. Vologases I later died in 78, and was succeeded by his other son Vologases II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Vologases I and the Iranian Revival'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His reign is marked by a decided reaction against Hellenism. He was influential in reverting the Hellenization by going back to Iranian customs and traditions of Achaemenid times. He replaced the G
2 CONC reek alphabet with the Pahlavi script, and on some coins the initials of his name appear in Pahlavi letters. He also reverted the Greek names of Iranian cities to Iranian names. According to Zoroastri
2 CONC an texts, Vologases I ordered the collection of the ancient Avestan texts. On some of his coins a fire temple appears for the first time, starting a tradition which continued for several hundred years
2 CONC  to the end of Sasanians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases I built cities including Valashabad (also known as Valakhshkert, Vologesocerta, Valakhshgerd and Valakhshkard, literally meaning "Valakhsh built it") in the neighborhood of Ctesiphon, wit

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases I of Parthia ruled the Parthian Empire (a forerunner of today's Iran) from about 51 to 78. Son of Vonones II by a Greek concubine, he succeeded his father in 51. He gave the kingdom of Me
2 CONC dia Atropatene to his brother Pacorus II, and occupied Armenia for another brother, Tiridates. This led to a long war with the Roman Empire (54–63), which was ably conducted by the Roman general Cor
2 CONC bulo.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The power of Vologases was weakened by an attack of the Dahan and Sacan nomads, a rebellion of the Hyrcanians, and the usurpation of his son Vardanes II. According to Josephus, he was prevented fro
2 CONC m attacking the vassal king of Adiabene by an invasion of the eastern nomads. At last a peace was concluded, by which Tiridates was acknowledged as king of Armenia, but had to become a vassal of the R
2 CONC omans; he went to Rome, where Roman emperor Nero gave him back the diadem; from that time an Arsacid dynasty ruled in Armenia under Roman supremacy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vologases was satisfied with this result, and honored the memory of Nero (Suetonius Nero, 57), though he stood in good relations with Vespasian also, to whom he offered an army of 40,000 archers in
2 CONC  the war against Vitellius. Soon afterwards the Alani, a great nomadic tribe beyond the Caucasus, invaded Media and Armenia; Vologases applied in vain for help to Vespasian. It appears that the Persia
2 CONC n losses in the east also could not be repaired; Hyrcania remained an independent kingdom. Vologases died in about 78 and was succeeded by his son Vologases II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His reign is marked by a decided reaction against Hellenism; he built Vologesocerta (Balashkert) in the neighborhood of Ctesiphon with the intention of drawing to this new town the inhabitants of S

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athenais (flourished 1st century BC) was a Princess from the Kingdom of Commagene whom through marriage became a Queen of Media Atropatene and possibly of Sophene.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athenais was a monarch of Armenian and Greek descent. She was one of the five children and youngest one born to King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene who reigned from 70 BC until 38 BC, and his wife,
2 CONC  Queen Isias Philostorgos. Her paternal grandparents were the previous ruling Commagenean monarchs Mithridates I Callinicus and his wife, the Seleucid Princess and Queen Laodice VII Thea. While her ma
2 CONC ternal grandparents, was the Roman Client King of Cappadocia, Ariobarzanes I Philoromaios who reigned from 95 BC until 63/62 BC and his wife, Queen Athenais Philostorgos I. Her maternal uncle was the 
2 CONC Roman Client King of Cappadocia, Ariobarzanes II Philopator and her maternal aunt-in-marriage was Athenais Philostorgos II. Her maternal aunt-in-marriage was a Pontian Princess who was the daughter of
2 CONC  King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his second marriage to the Anatolian Greek Macedonian noblewoman and Pontian Queen Monime. So, Athenais was the namesake of her maternal grandmother, her maternal a
2 CONC unt-in-marriage and was the third woman name called Athenais in the family of Ariobarzanes I Philoromaios.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athenais was born and raised in the Kingdom of Commagene. At an unknown date, Athenais married King Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene. Artavasdes I was a monarch of Median and possibly of Armenian, 
2 CONC Greek descent who served as King of Media Atropatene from 56 BC til 31 BC and later as a Roman Client King of Sophene from 30 BC til 20 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athenais’ name is known from surviving numismatic evidence, as her royal title on coins is in Greek ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΑ ΑΘΗΝΑΙΣ or of Queen Athenais. Surviving coinage reveals that Athenais m
2 CONC arried Artavasdes I as his Queen and probably married her sometime during his kingship of Media Atropatene. In the surviving coinage of Athenais and Artavasdes I, appears on one side a portrait of Art
2 CONC avasdes I wearing his crown showing his royal title in Greek, while on the other side a portrait is shown of Athenais with her royal title in Greek wearing a turreted tiara as a Diadem. These coins ar
2 CONC e dated from circa 30 BC from his kingship.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Not much is known on her relationship with Artavasdes I and her reign as Queen. Athenais bore Artavasdes I three known children:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>* Daughter, Iotapa who was engaged to the Ptolemaic Greek Prince Alexander Helios[7] who later married her maternal cousin, Mithridates III of Commagene
2 CONT <p>* Son, Ariobarzanes II</p>
2 CONT <p>* Son, Darius II. He married an unnamed Parthian Arsacid Princess, by whom they had two sons: the Parthian Kings Artabanus III and Vonones II.

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} '''Artavasdes I''' was a king of Media Atropatene. As an enemy of Artavasdes II of Armenia and his son Artaxias II, Artavasdes I was mentioned in diplomatic affairs of Cleopatra VII of
2 CONC  Egypt and Mark Anthony.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>===Biography===</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When [[6000000001336650473]] led his campaign against Parthia in 36 BC, Artavasdes I was the ally of the Parthian king Phraates IV. Antony led his troops from Zeugma northward into Armenia and then
2 CONC  invaded the domain of Artavasdes I. Antony did not want to attack Parthia from the west, which was the shortest way, but surprisingly from the north. Antony allegedly used this strategy on the advice
2 CONC  of Artavasdes II of Armenia, the enemy of Artavasdes I. Antony moved with his army in fast marches to Phraaspa, the strong fortified capital of Media Atropatene, where Artavasdes I had got his family
2 CONC  to safety. Meantime Artavasdes I had joined the army of Phraates IV. Antony was not able to take Phraaspa and besieged the city, but Artavasdes I and the Parthian commander Monaeses destroyed two leg
2 CONC ions of a Antony's general, Oppius Statianus, who had slowly followed with the siege machines of the Antony's troops. Antony could not capture Phraaspa without these machines. Therefore he had to with
2 CONC draw and Parthia was not invaded.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>So Artavasdes I had maintained his ground against the Romans but his domain had been severely ravaged. Besides his stronger ally Phraates IV treated him condescending and gave him only little booty
2 CONC . Therefore in 35 BC Artavasdes I offered Antony an alliance against Parthia, and Antony gladly accepted. To deepen this friendship Alexander Helios, the son of Antony and Cleopatra VII of Egypt, was 
2 CONC betrothed to Artavasdes’ daughter Iotapa, although both were infants (34 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 33 BC Antony met his coalition partner on the river Araxes; they agreed that Antony should support Artavasdes I against Parthia and that the Median king should help Antony against Octavian. They
2 CONC  interchanged parts of their troops. The domain of Artavasdes I was enlarged with parts of Armenia. Antony had returned a standard that the Median king had taken from Oppius Statianus in 36 BC, and al
2 CONC so took Iotape along with him. With the help of the Roman reinforcements Artavasdes I was initially able to repulse the Parthian attack. But before the Battle of Actium Antony called back his Roman tr
2 CONC oops without sending back the Median reinforcements. This time Phraates IV defeated Artavasdes who was captured in 30 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artavasdes finally escaped to Augustus who received him friendly, gave him back his daughter Iotapa and made him a client king of Lesser Armenia. He died shortly before 20 BC at the age of 39 years
2 CONC , probably at Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>===Family===</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene was the son and successor of king Ariobarzanes I. He was a son-in-law of Antiochus I Theos of Commagene. His children included Ariobarzanes II, Iotapa, who was enga
2 CONC ged to Alexander Helios and later married Mithridates III of Commagene, and Darius, who was mentioned to be the father of Artabanus II of Parthia.

2 CONT <p>Atropatene was an ancient region in modern north western Iran, formerly a part of Media.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Atropatene was the name of Iranian Azerbaijan from the time of Alexander the Great until the Arab conquest of Iran, after which Arabs modified the name into Azerbaijan. It was called Atropatene or 
2 CONC Media Atropatene after Atropates who made it independent soon after the death of Alexander the Great. Before that, it was called Matiene after the Matiani, an Iranic people who settled there. Before t
2 CONC he Matiani came, it was called Mannae, and the people Mannaeans. From Persian times, the capital was Gazaca, south of Lake Matianus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lesser Armenia (also known as Armenia Minor and Armenia Inferior, "Փոքր Հայք" "Pokr Hayq" in Armenian) refers to the Armenian populated regions, primarily to the west & north west of the an
2 CONC cient Armenian kingdom and north east of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. This included such regions as Hamshen, the area where the ethnic Armenian Hamshenis originated.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lesser Armenia was the portion of historic Armenia and the Armenian Highland lying west of the river Euphrates. It received its name to distinguish it from the larger remainder of historic Armenia 
2 CONC — Greater Armenia (or Armenia Major).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prior to 4th century BC, the territory of Lesser Armenia was part of the ancient Armenian kingdom, which was ruled by the royal dynasty of Orontids (Yervanduni) and, in the 4th c. BC, was subject t
2 CONC o the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Following the campaigns of Alexander the Great in 330s BC, as the Persian Empire collapsed, Mithrdates, an Armenian general of the Persian army, declared himself king 
2 CONC of Lesser Armenia. Thus two independent kingdoms emerged from the territory of the ancient Armenian kingdom — Lesser Armenia and Greater Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By the 3rd century BC, the kingdom of Lesser Armenia extended to the Black Sea coast. It was conquered by Romans in the 1st century BC. It was later reunited with the kingdom of Greater Armenia und
2 CONC er the Arshakuni king Tiridates III. After the division of Armenia by Byzantian and Sassanid Persian Empires in 387 AD, Lesser Armenia, along with western regions of Greater Armenia, became part of By
2 CONC zantine Empire. Its population remained Armenian, and the territory was included in the Byzantian military administrations of First Armenia, Second Armenia, Third Armenia, and Fourth Armenia. The Chri
2 CONC stian Armenian population of Lesser Armenia continued its existence in the area until the Armenian Genocide of 1915-23.

2 CONT <p>=Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, also known as Artavasdes I of Atropatene, Artavasdes I and Artavasdes (before or about 59-about 20 BC) was a Prince who served as a King of Media Atropatene. Artav
2 CONC asdes I was an enemy of King Artavasdes II of Armenia and his son Artaxias II. He was a contemporary with the Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony, as Artavasdes I was me
2 CONC ntioned in their diplomatic affairs.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family Background & Early Life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artavasdes I was of Median and possibly of Armenian, Greek descent. He was the child born to Ariobarzanes I by an unnamed wife. His probable paternal uncle could have been Darius I. He was born and
2 CONC  raised in the Kingdom of Media Atropatene. Artavasdes I is the namesake of his ancestor, Artabazanes a previous ruling King of Media Atropatene in the 3rd century BC, as the name Artavasdes is a vari
2 CONC ation of the name Artabazanes (see Asha).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to modern genealogies the father of Artavasdes I, Ariobarzanes I was a son of a previous ruling King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the 
2 CONC Artaxiad Dynasty who was a daughter of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great and his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship in
2 CONC  opposition to the lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty. Another possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Artavasdes b
2 CONC ears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Reign as King'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artavasdes I succeeded his father as King, when Ariobarzanes I died in 56 BC. When Mark Antony led his campaign against the Parthian Empire in 36 BC, Artavasdes I was an ally of the King Phraates I
2 CONC V of Parthia. Antony led his troops from Zeugma northward into Armenia and then invaded the domain of Artavasdes I. Antony did not want to attack Parthia from the west, which was the shortest way, but
2 CONC  surprisingly from the north. Antony allegedly used this strategy on the advice of Artavasdes II of Armenia, the enemy of Artavasdes I. Antony moved with his army in fast marches to Phraaspa, the stro
2 CONC ng fortified capital of Media Atropatene, where Artavasdes I had got his family to safety. Meantime Artavasdes I had joined the army of Phraates IV.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony was not able to take Phraaspa and besieged the city, but Artavasdes I and the Parthian commander Monaeses destroyed two legions of Antony's general, Oppius Statianus, who had slowly followed
2 CONC  with the siege machines of the Antony's troops. Antony could not capture Phraaspa without these machines. Therefore, he had to withdraw to Armenia and Parthia was not invaded.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>So Artavasdes I had maintained his ground against the Romans but his domain had been severely ravaged. Besides his stronger ally Phraates IV treated him condescending and gave him only little booty
2 CONC  and was near depriving him of his dominion. Therefore, in 35 BC Artavasdes I offered Antony an alliance against Parthia, and Antony gladly accepted. To deepen this friendship Alexander Helios, the so
2 CONC n of Antony and Cleopatra VII, was betrothed to Artavasdes I’s daughter Iotapa, although both were infants in 34 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 33 BC Antony met his coalition partner on the river Araxes; they agreed that Antony should support Artavasdes I against Parthia and that the Median King should help Antony against Octavian. They

2 CONC s without sending back the Median reinforcements. This time Phraates IV defeated Artavasdes I who was captured in 30 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During Artavasdes' imprisonment, a civil war between the Parthians later took place, which gave him the opportunity to escape prison. He took refuge with Augustus, who received him with friendlines
2 CONC s, gave him back his daughter Iotapa and made him a Client King of Lesser Armenia. He died around 20 BC probably in Rome. Artavasdes I was succeeded in the Kingship of Media Atropatene by Asinnalus.

2 CONT <p>The Parnavazian Dynasty (335 BC-65 BC), was founded by King Parnavaz I of Iberia in East Georgia in the province of Kartli. In the period of his reign and his heirs, from the 3rd century BC, Kartli
2 CONC  presented a strong political unit. It embraced not only the territory of East Georgia, but also included areas beyond – the Southwestern part of historical Georgia (Tao-Klarjeti, Speri, the Kingdom
2 CONC  of Egrisi, and others). This contributed to closer contacts among the Georgian population and paved the way for a quick unification of tribes of the same ethnic roots and for the eventual formation o

2 CONT <p>Iberia (Georgian — იბერია, Latin: Iberia or Iberi and Greek: Ἰβηρία) was a name given by the ancient Greeks and Romans to the ancient Georgian kingdom of Kartli (4th century BC
2 CONC -5th century AD) corresponding roughly to the eastern and southern parts of the present day Georgia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The term “Caucasian Iberia” (or Eastern Iberia) is used to distinguish it from the Iberian Peninsula, where the present day states of Spain, Andorra and Portugal are located. The Caucasian Iber
2 CONC ians provided a basis for later Georgian statehood and formed a core of the present day Georgian people (or Kartvelians). What their possible relation to the Western Iberians was, or why both the peop
2 CONC les had the same name in Greek, is not known at present (but see below, under "Eastern and Western Iberians").
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Earliest history</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The area was inhabited in earliest times by several relative tribes, collectively called Iberians (the Eastern Iberians) by ancient authors. Locals called their country Kartli after a mythic chief,
2 CONC  Kartlos.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Moschi mentioned by various classic historians, and their possible descendants, the Saspers (who were mentioned by Herodotus), may have played a crucial role in the consolidation of the tribes 
2 CONC inhabiting the area. The Moschi had moved slowly to the northeast forming settlements as they traveled. The chief of these was Mtskheta, the future capital of the Iberian kingdom. The Mtskheta tribe w
2 CONC as later ruled by a principal locally known as mamasakhlisi (“the father of the household” in Georgian).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The medieval Georgian source Moktsevai Kartlisai (“Conversion of Kartli”) speak also about Azo and his people, who came from Arrian-Kartli - the initial home of the proto-Iberians, which had be
2 CONC en under Achaemenid rule until the fall of the Persian Empire - to settle on the site where Mtskheta was to be founded. Another Georgian chronicle Kartlis Tskhovreba (“History of Kartli”) claims A
2 CONC zo to be an officer of Alexander’s, who massacred a local ruling family and conquered the area, until being defeated at the end of the 4th century BC by Prince Pharnavaz, who was at that time a loca
2 CONC l chief.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Pharnavaz I and his descendants</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pharnavaz, victorious in power struggle, became the first king of Iberia (ca. 302-ca. 237 BC). Driving back an invasion, he subjugated the neighbouring areas, including significant part of the west
2 CONC ern Georgian state of Colchis (locally known as Egrisi), and seems to have secured recognition of the newly founded state by the Seleucids of Syria. Now Pharnavaz focused on social projects, including
2 CONC  the citadel of the capitol, the Armaztsikhe, and the idol of the god Armazi. He also reformed the Georgian written language, and created a new system of administration subdividing the country in seve
2 CONC ral counties called saeristavos. His successors managed to gain control over the mountainous passes of the Caucasus with the Daryal (also known as the Iberian Gates) being the most important of them.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The period following this time of prosperity was one of incessant warfare though. Iberia was forced to defend against numerous invasions into their territories. Iberia lost some of its southern pro
2 CONC vinces to Armenia, and the Colchian lands seceded to form separate princedoms (sceptuchoi). In the end of the 2nd century BC, the Pharnavazid king Farnadjom was dethroned by his own subjects and the c
2 CONC rown given to the Armenian prince Arshak who ascended the Iberian throne in 93 BC, establishing the Arshakids dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Roman period</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This close association with Armenia brought upon the country an invasion (65 BC) by the Roman general Pompey, who was then at war with Mithradates VI of Pontus, and Armenia; but Rome did not establ
2 CONC ish her power permanently over Iberia. Nineteen years later, the Romans again marched (36 BC) on Iberia forcing King Pharnavaz II to join their campaign against Albania.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While another Georgian kingdom of Colchis was administered as a Roman province, Iberia freely accepted the Roman Imperial protection. A stone inscription discovered at Mtskheta speaks of the first-
2 CONC century ruler Mihdrat I (A.D. 58-106) as "the friend of the Caesars" and the king "of the Roman-loving Iberians." Emperor Vespasian fortified the ancient Mtskheta site of Arzami for the Iberian kings 
2 CONC in 75 A.D.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The next two centuries saw a continuation of Roman influence over the area, but by the reign of King Pharsman II (116 – 132) Iberia had regained some of its former power. Relations between the Ro
2 CONC man Emperor Hadrian and Pharsman II were strained, though Hadrian is said to have sought to appease Pharsman. However, it was only under Hadrian's successor Antoninus Pius that relations improved to t
2 CONC he extent that Pharsman is said to have even visited Rome, where Dio Cassius reports that a statue was erected in his honor and that rights to sacrifice were given. The period brought a major change t
2 CONC o the political status of Iberia with Rome recognizing them as an ally, rather than their former status as a subject state, a political situation which remained the same, even during the Empire's host
2 CONC ilities with the Parthians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Between Rome/Byzantium and Persia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Decisive for the future history of Iberia was the foundation of the Sassanian Empire in 224. By replacing the weak Parthian realm with a strong, centralized state, it changed the political orientat
2 CONC ion of Iberia away from Rome. Iberia became a tributary of the Sassanian state during the reign of Shapur I (241-272). Relations between the two countries seem to have been friendly at first, as Iberi
2 CONC a cooperated in Persian campaigns against Rome, and the Iberian king Amazasp III (260-265) was listed as a high dignitary of the Sassanian realm, not a vassal who had been subdued by force of arms. Bu
2 CONC t the aggressive tendencies of the Sasanians were evident in their propagation of Zoroastrianism, which was probably established in Iberia between the 260s and 290s. However, in the Peace of Nisibis (
2 CONC 298) Rome was acknowledged their reign over the area, but recognized Mirian III, the first of the Chosroid dynasty, as King of Iberia. Byzantine predominance proved crucial, since King Mirian II and l
2 CONC eading nobles converted to Christianity around 317. The event is related with the mission of a Cappadocian woman, Saint Nino, who since 303 preached Christianity in the Georgian kingdom of Iberia (Eas
2 CONC tern Georgia).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The religion would become a strong tie between Georgia and Rome (later Byzantium) and have a large scale impact on the state's culture and society. However, after the emperor Julian was slain durin
2 CONC g his failed campaign in Persia in 363, Rome ceded control of Iberia to Persia, and King Varaz-Bakur I (Asphagur) (363-365) became a Persian vassal, an outcome confirmed by the Peace of Acilisene in 3
2 CONC 87. Although a later ruler of Kartli, Pharsman IV (406-409), preserved his country's autonomy and ceased to pay tribute to Persia. Persia prevailed, and Sassanian kings began to appoint a viceroy (pit
2 CONC iaxae/bidaxae) to keep watch on their vassal. They eventually made the office hereditary in the ruling house of Lower Kartli, thus inaugurating the Kartli pitiaxate, which brought an extensive territo
2 CONC ry under its control. Although it remained a part of the kingdom of Kartli, its viceroys turned their domain into a center of Persian influence. Sassanian rulers put the Christianity of the Georgians 
2 CONC to a severe test. They promoted the teachings of Zoroaster, and by the middle of the 5th century Zoroastrianism had become a second official religion in eastern Georgia alongside Christianity. However
2 CONC , efforts to convert the common Georgian people were generally unsuccessful.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The early reign of the Iberian king Vakhtang I dubbed Gorgasali (447-502) was marked by relative revival of the kingdom. Formally vassal of the Persians, he secured the northern borders by subjugat
2 CONC ing the Caucasian mountaineers, and brought the adjacent western and southern Georgian lands under his control. He established an autocephalic patriarchate at Mtskheta, and made Tbilisi his capital. I
2 CONC n 482, he led a general uprising against Persia. A desperate war for independence lasted for twenty years, but he could not get the Byzantine support, and was defeated dying himself in battle in 502.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Fall of the kingdom</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The continuing rivalry between Byzantium and Persia for supremacy in the Caucasus, and the next unsuccessful insurrection (523) of the Georgians under Gurgen had tragic consequences for the country
2 CONC . Thereafter, the king of Iberia had only nominal power, while the country was effectively ruled by the Persians. In 580, Hormizd IV (578-590) abolished the monarchy after the death of King Bakur III,
2 CONC  and Iberia became a Persian province ruled by a marzpan (governor). Georgian nobles urged the Byzantine emperor Maurice to revive the kingdom of Iberia in 582, but in 591 Byzantium and Persia agreed 
2 CONC to divide Iberia between them, with Tbilisi to be in Persian hands and Mtskheta to be under Byzantine control.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the beginning of the 7th century the truce between Byzantium and Persia collapsed. The Iberian Prince Stephanoz I (ca. 590-627), decided in 607 to join forces with Persia in order to reunite all
2 CONC  the territories of Iberia, a goal he seems to have accomplished. But Emperor Heraclius's offensive in 627 and 628 brought victory over the Georgians and Persians and ensured Byzantine predominance in
2 CONC  western and eastern Georgia until the invasion of the Caucasus by the Arabs.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Arab period</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Main article: Emirate of Tbilisi</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Arabs reached Iberia about 645 and forced its eristavi (prince), Stephanoz II (637-ca. 650), to abandon his allegiance to Byzantium and recognize the Caliph as his suzerain. Iberia thus became 
2 CONC a tributary state and an Arab emir was installed in Tbilisi about 653. At the beginning of the 9th century, eristavi Ashot I (813-830) of the new Bagrationi dynasty, from his base in southwestern Geor
2 CONC gia, took advantage of the weakening of the Arab rule to establish himself as hereditary prince (titled as kouropalates) of Iberia. A successor, Adarnase II of Tao, formally vassal of Byzantium, was c
2 CONC rowned as the “king of Georgians” in 888. His descendant Bagrat III (975-1014), brought the various principalities together to form a united Georgian state.

2 CONT <p>[edit] Eastern and Western Iberians</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The similarity of the name with the old inhabitants of the Iberian peninsula, the 'Western' Iberians, has lead to an idea of ethnogenetical kinship between them and the people of Caucasian Iberia (
2 CONC called the 'Eastern' Iberians).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It has been advocated by various ancient and medieval authors, although they differed in approach to the problem of the initial place of their origin. The theory seems to have been popular in medie
2 CONC val Georgia. The prominent Georgian religious writer Giorgi Mthatzmindeli (George of Mt Athos) (1009-1065)[1] writes about the wish of certain Georgian nobles to travel to the Iberian peninsula and vi

2 CONT <p>Family, Ancestry and Early Life Antiochus I was the son and probably the only child of King Mithridates I Callinicus and Queen Laodice VII Thea of Commagene. Antiochus was half Armenian and half Gr

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus’ mother, Laodice VII Thea, was a Greek Princess of the Seleucid Empire. Laodice’s father was the Seleucid King Antiochus VIII Grypus while her mother was Ptolemaic Princess and later 
2 CONC Seleucid Queen Tryphaena. Thus, Antiochus was a direct descendant of Seleucus I Nicator of the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt, Antigonus I Monophthalmus of Macedonia, Lysimachus of Thrace a
2 CONC nd the Macedonian regent, Antipater. The five men had served as generals under Greek Macedonian King, Alexander the Great. Antiochus’ parents had married as part of a peace alliance between their ki

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus made peace with general Pompey in 64 BC, when Pompey successfully invaded Syria. Antiochus and Pompey then became allies. Antiochus in 59 BC was granted the Toga Praetexta and was given o
2 CONC fficial recognition from the Roman Senate as an ally to Rome. Antiochus was given an ivory sceptre, an embroidered triumphal robe and he was greeted as king, ally and friend. This recognition was a tr
2 CONC adition, which recognises and rewards the allies to Rome. From his reign onwards, monarchs from Commagene proved to be the most loyal Roman allies. When Marcus Tullius Cicero was Roman governor of Cil

2 CONT <p>Mount Nemrut Antiochus is famous for building the impressive religious sanctuary of Nemrud Dağı or Mount Nemrut. When Antiochus reigned as king he created a royal cult for himself and was prepari
2 CONC ng to be worshipped after his death. Antiochus was inspired to create his own cult in a Hellenized form of Zoroastrianism. Antiochus left many Greek inscriptions revealing many aspects of his religion
2 CONC  and explaining his purpose of action. In one inscription, Antiochus suggests his tomb must be in a high and holy place, remote from the people and close to the gods with whom he is in rank. Antiochus
2 CONC  wanted his body to be preserved for eternity. The gods he worshipped were a syncretism of Greek and Persian deities, some of them personifications of the Sun, Moon and planets. The monumental effigie
2 CONC s had Persian and Greek influences. Persian influences were the clothes, headgear and the colossal state of the deities. While the Greek influences were representation of the gods and showing ancestor
2 CONC s of the king. The deities bore Greek features and styles.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus practiced astrology of a very esoteric kind, and laid the basis for a calendrical reform, by linking the Commagene year, which till then had been based on the movements of the Moon, to th

2 CONT <p>Priests wore traditional Persian robes and adorn all effigies with crowns of gold as worship to the ancestors. The priests would place incense, herbs and sacrifices on the altars. All the citizens

2 CONT <p>Antiochus I Theos Dikaios Epiphanes Philorhomaios Philhellen (Greek: Ἀντίοχος ὀ Θεός Δίκαιος Ἐπιφανής Φιλορωμαίος Φιλέλλην, "Antiochos the Just and
2 CONC  Eminent God, friend of the Romans and friend of the Greeks", c. 86 BC-38 BC), was an Armenian king of Commagene from 70 BC until his death, and the most famous ruler of that kingdom.

2 CONT <p>The ruins of the tomb-sanctuary of Antiochus Theos are magnificent to behold even today. The site of his interment atop Mount Nemrut, a.k.a. Nemrut dagi, was named to the UNESCO World Heritage list
2 CONC  in 1987. Several sandstone bas reliefs discovered at the site contain the oldest known images of two figures shaking hands.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus I was the son and probably the only child of King Mithridates I Callinicus and Queen Laodice VII Thea of Commagene. Antiochus was half Armenian and half Greek, a distant member of the Oro
2 CONC ntid Dynasty.[2] Antiochus’ father Mithridates was the son of King of Commagene Sames II Theosebes Dikaios, while his mother is unknown. Mithridates in descent was related to the kings of Parthia an
2 CONC d, according to archaeological research at Mount Nemrut, was also a descendant of King Darius I of Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus’ mother, Laodice VII Thea, was a Greek Princess of the Seleucid Empire. Laodice’s father was the Seleucid King Antiochus VIII Grypus while her mother was Ptolemaic Princess and later 
2 CONC Seleucid Queen Tryphaena (see Cleopatra VI of Egypt). Thus, Antiochus was a direct descendant of Seleucus I Nicator of the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt, Antigonus I Monophthalmus of Maced
2 CONC onia, Lysimachus of Thrace and the Macedonian regent, Antipater. The five men had served as generals under Greek Macedonian King, Alexander the Great. Antiochus’ parents had married as part of a pea
2 CONC ce alliance between their kingdoms, while his father had embraced Greek culture. Little is known of his early life. When his father died in 70 BC, Antiochus succeeded his father as king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus married a Greek woman called Isias. They had five children who were:

2 CONT <p>While the Roman Republic was annexing territories in Anatolia through skilled diplomacy, Antiochus was able to keep Commagene independent from the Romans. Antiochus is first mentioned in the ancien
2 CONC t sources in 69 BC, when the general Lucullus’ campaign against the Armenian King Tigranes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus made peace with general Pompey in 64 BC, when Pompey successfully invaded Syria. Antiochus and Pompey then became allies. Antiochus in 59 BC was granted the Toga Praetexta and was given o
2 CONC fficial recognition from the Roman Senate as an ally to Rome. Antiochus was given an ivory sceptre, an embroidered triumphal robe and he was greeted as king, ally and friend. This recognition was a tr
2 CONC adition, which recognises and rewards the allies to Rome. From his reign onwards, monarchs from Commagene proved to be the most loyal Roman allies. When Marcus Tullius Cicero was Roman governor of Cil
2 CONC icia in 51 BC, Antiochus provided Cicero with intelligence of the movements of the Parthians. During the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey, Antiochus provided troops for Pompey.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 38 BC a legatus of Triumvir Mark Antony, Publius Ventidius Bassus, after conquering the Parthians wanted to declare war on Antiochus and his kingdom. Mark Antony and Publius Ventidius Bassus wer
2 CONC e attracted to the treasury and wealth that Commagene had. As Antony and Bassus, were about to declare a siege on Commagene and its capital Samosata, Antiochus made peace with Antony and Bassus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus is famous for building the impressive religious sanctuary of Nemrud Dağı or Mount Nemrut. When Antiochus reigned as king he created a royal cult for himself and was preparing to be wors
2 CONC hipped after his death. Antiochus was inspired to create his own cult in a Hellenized form of Zoroastrianism. Antiochus left many Greek inscriptions revealing many aspects of his religion and explaini
2 CONC ng his purpose of action. In one inscription, Antiochus suggests his tomb must be in a high and holy place, remote from the people and close to the gods with whom he is in rank. Antiochus wanted his b
2 CONC ody to be preserved for eternity. The gods he worshipped were a syncretism of Greek and Persian deities, some of them personifications of the Sun, Moon and planets. The monumental effigies had Persian
2 CONC  and Greek influences. Persian influences were the clothes, headgear and the colossal state of the deities. While the Greek influences were representation of the gods and showing ancestors of the king
2 CONC . The deities bore Greek features and styles.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus practiced astrology of a very esoteric kind, and laid the basis for a calendrical reform, by linking the Commagene year, which till then had been based on the movements of the Moon, to th
2 CONC e Sothic (Star of Sirius) cycle used by the Egyptians as the basis of their calendar.

2 CONC which was celebrated on the 10th of each month and his coronation which was celebrated on the 16th of each month. He would allocate funds for these events.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Priests wore traditional Persian robes and adorn all effigies with crowns of gold as worship to the ancestors. The priests would place incense, herbs and sacrifices on the altars. All the citizens 
2 CONC and military garrison were invited to the banquets in honor of the illustrious deceased. During feasts, grudging attitudes were forbidden and priests decreed that the people should enjoy themselves, e
2 CONC at and drink wine. Wine was served however, it was allowed to be consumed during the one day festivities. Antiochus created women musicians for the banquets. Antiochus’ tomb was forgotten for centur
2 CONC ies, until 1883 when archaeologists from Germany excavated the tomb.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to inscriptions, Antiochus appeared to have been a pious person and had a generous spirit. In another city of the kingdom Arsameia, ruins were found of the royal palace. This palace is kn
2 CONC own as Eski Vale or Old Castle. In Arsameia, Antiochus left many inscriptions in Greek of his public works program and how he glorified the city.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus I was the son and probably the only child of King Mithridates I Callinicus and Queen Laodice VII Thea of Commagene. Antiochus was half Armenian, a distant member of the Orontid Dynasty an
2 CONC d half Greek. Antiochus’ father Mithridates was the son of King of Commagene Sames II Theosebes Dikaios and an unidentified woman. Mithridates was possibly related to the kings of Parthia and, in th
2 CONC e light of archaeological discoveries at Mount Nemrut, even claimed descent from the Achaemenid family of King Darius I of Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>More certain are his dynastic connections to the Diadochi. Antiochus’ mother, Laodice VII Thea, was a Greek princess of the Seleucid Empire. Laodice’s father was the Seleucid King Antiochus VII
2 CONC I Grypus, while her mother was a Ptolemaic princess and later Seleucid Queen Tryphaena (see Cleopatra VI of Egypt). Thus, Antiochus was a direct descendant of Seleucus I Nicator of the Seleucid Empire
2 CONC , Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt, Antigonus I Monophthalmus of Macedonia and Asia, Lysimachus of Thrace and the Macedonian regent, Antipater. These five men, the Diadochi 'successors', had served as general
2 CONC s under Macedonian King, Alexander the Great. Antiochus’ parents had married as part of a peace alliance between their kingdoms. Little is known of his early life and education, aside from its philh
2 CONC ellenic aspect; however, it seems that when his father died in 70 BC, Antiochus succeeded his father as king.

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus I Theos Dikaios Epiphanes Philorhomaios Philhellen (69–40 BC), was the most important king of the small Middle East kingdom of Commagene, which was situated in a region that is now in s
2 CONC outh-eastern Turkey and inhabited largely by ethnic Kurds.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus was the son of king Mithradates I Callinicus and the Seleucid princess Laodice, daughter of the Syrian King Antiochus VIII. This marriage had been arranged as part of a settlement by Mith
2 CONC radates' father Samos II to ensure peace between the Kingdom of Commagene and the Seleucid Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus tried to balance the interests of his kingdom with the reality of the world power of the Roman Empire and preserve as much as possible Commagene's independence. Despite his efforts, his r
2 CONC eign ended with the Commagene submitting to Rome, becoming a client-state under EmperorAugustus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anthiochus was a king who took his religion, a Hellenized form of Zoroastrianism, very seriously. He left behind a large number of Greek inscriptions, revealing many aspects of the royal cult he pr
2 CONC omoted. The kings of Commagene claimed descent from both the Persian and Selucid royal houses, therefore the gods they worshipped were a syncretism of Greek and Persian deities, some of them were pers
2 CONC onifications of the Sun, Moon and planets. He is said to nhave practised astrology of a very esoteric kind, and layed the basis for a calendrical reform, by linking the Commagene year, which till then
2 CONC  had been based on the movements of the Moon, to the Sothic (Star of Sirius) cycle used by the Egyptians as the basis of their calendar. This would suggest that Antiochus was knowledgeable about, if n
2 CONC ot fully initiated into the Hermetic tradition.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Today Antiochus is most famous for founding the impressive sanctuary of Nemrud Dagi, which is close to the city of Kahta on a road leading to Mount Nimrod. Its most important monument is his so-cal
2 CONC led Hierothesion, where his remains were buried. It was constructed not to be a simple tomb but as a place where he would gather his people for religious festivities connected with either his birthday
2 CONC  or coronation. Forgotten for centuries, it was excavated in 1883 by a German team of archeologists.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kahta, the gateway to the lost kingdom of Commagene, is situated north of the modern Turkish civil engineering project Ataturk Baraji (Dam), which distributes the waters of the Euphrates River. Unf
2 CONC ortunately, the lake it formed drowned Commagene's original capital of Samosata, built by Samos I in the early 3rd century B.C.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Isias, surnamed Philostorgos or Philostorgus (Greek: η Ισίας Φιλόστοργος, meaning Isias the loving one) was a Princess of Cappadocia who lived in the 1st century BC. Through her ma
2 CONC rriage to King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene, she became the Queen of Commagene. Very little is known on her. She was half Persian and half Greek. Isias was the daughter of King Ariobarzanes I of Cap
2 CONC padocia and his wife Queen Athenais Philostorgos I, while her brother was King Ariobarzanes II of Cappadocia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Isias and Antiochus I had five children who were:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>* Son, Mithridates II of Commagene - who succeeded Antiochus I after his death in 38 BC
2 CONT <p>* Daughter, Laodice, who married King Orodes II of Parthia</p>
2 CONT <p>* Son, Antiochus II of Commagene</p>
2 CONT <p>* Daughter, Antiochis of Commagene</p>
2 CONT <p>* Daughter, Athenais who married King Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>She appeared to have died of unknown causes sometime between the late 30s or early 20s BC. Isias was buried along with her daughter and her granddaughter on a burial site. This burial site was a mo
2 CONC nument known as the Karakush or Karakus Tumulus, also known as The Black Bird. The monument received its name because there is a column topped by an eagle, which has earned the mound name.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This burial sanctuary was constructed and built by her son King Mithridates II of Commagene. Mithridates II built this sanctuary to bury and honour the lives and the memories of Isias, her daughter
2 CONC  Antiochis and her granddaughter Aka I of Commagene. It is located 12 km or 7.5 miles from Kahta, Turkey. Each tumulus is surrounded by groups of three Doric Columns. Each column was about 9 metres or
2 CONC  29.5 feet high. It is topped with steles, reliefs and statues of a bull, lion and eagle.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This monument has Greek honorific inscriptions, which provides information about this site. It is inscribed on the external face of the two drums of the central column of the Northeast. Skipping a 
2 CONC couple of phrases where restoration has been doubtful, the inscription reads:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''This is the hierothesion [sacred site or foundation] of Isias, whom the great King Mithridates (she being his own mother)…deemed worthy of this final hour. And…Antiochis lies herein, the king
2 CONC ’s sister by the same mother, the most beautiful of women, whose life was short but her honours long-enduring. Both of these, as you see, preside here, and with them a daughter’s daughter, the dau
2 CONC ghter of Antiochis, Aka. A memorial of life with each other and of the king’s honour.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Isias’ name also appears in another honorific inscription dedicated by Mithridates II at the tomb of her other daughter Laodice:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''The great King Mithridates, the son of the great king Antiochus and queen Isias, dedicated this image to the unfading memory of queen Laodice, the king’s sister and the wife of Orodes, the king
2 CONC  of kings, and to her own honour.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Kingdom of Commagene was annexed in 72 by the Roman Emperor Vespasian, the vault of the tomb has been looted.

2 CONT <p>Atropatene was an ancient region in modern north western Iran, formerly a part of Media.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Atropatene was the name of Iranian Azerbaijan from the time of Alexander the Great until the Arab conquest of Iran, after which Arabs modified the name into Azerbaijan. It was called Atropatene or 
2 CONC Media Atropatene after Atropates who made it independent soon after the death of Alexander the Great. Before that, it was called Matiene after the Matiani, an Iranic people who settled there. Before t
2 CONC he Matiani came, it was called Mannae, and the people Mannaeans. From Persian times, the capital was Gazaca, south of Lake Matianus.

2 CONT <p>=Ariobarzanes I of Media Atropatene=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ariobarzanes I of Media Atropatene, also known as Ariobarzanes I of Media, Ariobarzanes of Atropatene, Ariobarzanes I and Ariobarzanes (flourished 1st century BC, ruled from 65 BC-56 BC) was a Prin
2 CONC ce who served as a King of Media Atropatene.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ariobarzanes I was a monarch of Median and possibly of Armenian, Greek descent. According to modern genealogies, Ariobarzanes I was a son of a previous ruling King Mithridates I and his wife, an un
2 CONC named Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a daughter of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great and his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descen
2 CONC dants to the Armenian Kingship in opposition to the lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty. Another possibility in linking Ariobarzanes I as a son born to Mithridates I and his wife is throug
2 CONC h his name. The name Ariobarzanes is a name of Iranian origin. There were Persian Satraps who bore this name as did some of the ancestors of Cleopatra of Pontus. Cleopatra was a Pontian Princess, who 
2 CONC was a daughter of King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his first wife, his sister Laodice.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Little is known on the life of Ariobarzanes I. Ariobarzanes I appeared to have succeeded Darius I as King of Media Atropatene in 65 BC, whom appeared to have a short reign. Ariobarzanes I and Dariu
2 CONC s I were related as they may had been brothers. Although Ariobarzanes I ruled from 65 BC til 56 BC, his reign in the time-scale would appear to preclude the short reign of Darius I and shows that he c
2 CONC ame to the throne sometime before 59 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Little is known on the reign of Ariobarzanes I. He appeared to have died in 56 BC, as he was succeeded by his son Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene. His son from an unnamed wife, was born before 59 
2 CONC BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Rome, two Epitaph inscriptions have been found bearing the name of Artavasdes. The Epitaphs are probably of the son and the grandson of a Median Atropatenian King called Ariobarzanes. However it
2 CONC  is uncertain, if the Ariobarzanes refers to Ariobarzanes I or his grandson Ariobarzanes II. Ariobarzanes I is mentioned in paragraph 33 of the Res Gestae Divi Augusti.

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes IV (flourished 1st century BC, died about 2 BC) was a Prince of the Kingdom of Armenia and member of the Artaxiad Dynasty who served as a Roman Client King of Armenia from 10 BC until 5 BC
2 CONC .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family Background & Early Life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes IV was the son born to Tigranes III by an unnamed mother. His known sibling was his younger paternal half-sister Erato who was born to another unnamed woman. Although Tigranes IV was the n
2 CONC amesake of his father, the name Tigranes was the most common royal name in the Artaxiad Dynasty and was among the most ancient names of the Armenian Kings. Tigranes IV was born and raised either in Ro
2 CONC me where his father lived in political exile for 10 years from 30 BC until 20 BC or during his father’s Kingship of Armenia in which he ruled from 20 BC until 10 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Kingship of Armenia'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes III died before 6 BC. In 10 BC, the Armenians installed Tigranes IV as King as the successor to his father. In accordance with Oriental custom or Hellenistic custom, Tigranes IV married hi
2 CONC s sister Erato in order to preserve the purity of the Artaxiad Royal blood line. Erato through marriage to her brother, became Queen and his Queen consort. From their sibling union at an unknown date,
2 CONC  Erato bore Tigranes IV an unnamed daughter who later married King Pharasmanes I of Iberia who ruled from 1 until 58, and by whom he had three sons: Mithridates I of Iberia, Rhadamistus and Amazaspus 
2 CONC (Amazasp) who is known from a Greek inscription found in Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although Tigranes IV and Erato were Roman Client Monarchs governing Armenia, they were both anti Roman and were not the choices of the Roman emperor Augustus for the Armenian throne, as their dual 
2 CONC rule did not have Roman approval and they leaned towards Parthia for support.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Rome and Parthia competed with one another for their protégés to have influence and govern Armenia. Roman Historian of the 4th century, Sextus Rufus informs us that anti-Roman sentiment was build
2 CONC ing in Armenia during the reign of Tigranes IV and Erato. Rufus also emphasizes that the Kingdom of Armenia was very strong during this period.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The dispossessed and the discontent of the ruling Artaxiad monarchs and their subjects towards Ancient Rome had instigated war with the aid of King Phraates V of Parthia. To avoid a full-scale war 
2 CONC with Rome, Phraates V soon ceased his support to the Armenian ruling Monarchs. This lead Tigranes IV and Erato, acknowledging Roman suzerainty; sending their good wishes and submission to Rome. August
2 CONC us receiving their submission to Rome and good wishes, allowed them to remain in power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes IV issued bronze coins with portraits of himself with Augustus with the inscription in Greek βασιλεύς μέγας νέος Τιγράνης (of great new king Tigranes), also issued
2 CONC  coins shared by Erato with the inscription in Greek Έρατω βασιλέως Τιγράνου άδελφή (Erato, sister of King Tigranes). Other coinage Tigranes IV and Erato issued together, is
2 CONC  a portrait of Tigranes IV heavily bearded with Erato with the Greek legend great king, Tigranes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sometime about 2 BC Tigranes IV was killed in battle, perhaps ending an internal Armenian revolt of those who were infuriated by the royal couple becoming allies to Rome. The war and the chaos that
2 CONC  occurred afterwards, Erato abdicated her throne and ended her rule over Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the situation surrounding Tigranes IV and Erato, the Armenians requested to Augustus, a new Armenian King. Augustus found and appointed Ariobarzanes as the new King of Armenia in 2 BC. Ariobar
2 CONC zanes through his father was a distant relative of the Artaxiad Dynasty as he was a descendant of an unnamed Artaxiad Princess who was a sister of King Artavasdes II of Armenia who married Ariobarzane

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Erato also known as Queen Erato (flourished second half of 1st century BC & first half of 1st century, died sometime after 12) was a Princess of the Kingdom of Armenia and member of the Artaxiad Dy
2 CONC nasty. She served as a Roman Client Queen of Armenia from 10 BC until 2 BC with her brother-husband King Tigranes IV. After a number of years living in political exile, she co-ruled with her distant p
2 CONC aternal relative the Herodian Prince Tigranes V as Roman Client Monarchs of Armenia from 6 until 12. She as Armenian Queen ruled on the Armenian throne twice. As a Queen of Armenia, she can be viewed 
2 CONC as one of the last hereditary rulers of her nation.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Origin of her name'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Erato is a name of ancient Greek origins which means "desired" or "lovely". In Greek mythology, Erato was one of the Muses and the name derived from the same root as Eros the Greek God of love.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family background & early life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Erato was the second child and the known daughter born to Tigranes III by an unnamed mother. Her known sibling was her older paternal half-brother Tigranes IV born to a previous unnamed wife of Tig

2 CONC  IV married Erato in order to preserve the purity of the Artaxiad Royal blood line. Erato through marriage to her brother, became Queen and his Queen consort.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Erato was the second Seleucid Greek descendant to have ruled as an Armenian Queen and as an Armenian Queen consort. The previous one was her paternal great, grandmother Cleopatra of Pontus, daughte
2 CONC r of King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his first wife, his sister Laodice. The first Seleucid Greek Princess to have married a King of Armenia, in which she became an Armenian Queen and as an Armenia
2 CONC n Queen consort, was her ancestor Antiochis, one of the sisters of King Antiochus III the Great.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Between 10 BC until 2 BC at an unknown date from their sibling union, Erato bore Tigranes IV an unnamed daughter. Their daughter went later on to marry King Pharasmanes I of Iberia who ruled from 1

2 CONC  married Ariobarzanes' paternal ancestor Mithridates, a previous ruling King of Media Atropatene.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Political exile: 2 BC-6 AD'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After abdicating her throne, leaving behind the war and chaos in Armenia, Erato had lived in political exile at an unknown location. Little is known on her during this period. Between 2 BC until 6,
2 CONC  Armenia saw two Roman Client Kings Ariobarzanes who ruled from 2 BC until 4 and his son, Artavasdes III who ruled from 4 until 6.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Co-rule from Tigranes V: 6-12 AD'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the year 6, Artavasdes III who served as King of Armenia was murdered by his subjects, as he was an unpopular ruler with the Armenians. As the Armenians grew weary of foreign Kings, Augustus rev
2 CONC ised his foreign policy and appointed the Herodian Prince Tigranes V as King of Armenia. Tigranes V was related to Artaxiad Dynasty as his late maternal grandmother was an Armenian Princess who may ha
2 CONC ve been the daughter of Artavasdes II of Armenia who possibly married King Archelaus of Cappadocia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes V was accompanied by his maternal grandfather, Archelaus of Cappadocia and the future Roman emperor Tiberius to Armenia, where he was installed as King at Artaxata. Artaxata became Tigrane
2 CONC s V's capital. In 6, Tigranes V ruled Armenia as a sole ruler. Sometime into his reign, the Armenian nobles being unsatisfied with his reign rebelled against Tigranes V. The same Armenian nobles resto
2 CONC red Erato back to the Armenian throne. Erato wanting to cooperate with Rome, co-ruled with Tigranes V. Her co-rule with Tigranes V is known and based from numismatic evidence. Erato and Tigranes V co-
2 CONC ruled together in Artaxata. There is a possibility that Erato and Tigranes V may have married and she may had served as a Queen consort to Tigranes V.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Little is known on Erato and Tigranes V co-ruling Armenia together. Erato and Tigranes V were overthrown under unknown circumstances in 12. Augustus kept Armenia as a client kingdom and appointed V
2 CONC onones I of Parthia as King of Armenia. The fate of Erato afterwards is unknown and Tigranes V may had remained living in Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Surviving evidence'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Roman Historians that mentions, discusses and informs us about Erato is Tacitus of the 1st and 2nd centuries, Cassius Dio of the 2nd and 3rd centuries and Sextus Rufus of the 4th century.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the National Library in Paris, currently have an image of her that appears on an ancient coin. Coinage has survived from her rule with Tigranes IV that they both issued together. Tigranes IV and
2 CONC  Erato share issued coins with the inscription in Greek Έρατω βασιλέως Τιγράνου άδελφή (Erato, sister of King Tigranes). Other shared issued coinage of Tigranes IV and Erato
2 CONC , is a portrait of Tigranes IV heavily bearded with Erato with the Greek legend great king, Tigranes. Coinage has also survived from Erato’s co-rule with Tigranes V.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Modern honors'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Erato is seen as a major and significant historical figure from pre-Christianity Armenia. From the 1st century until present, Erato is still a highly regarded monarch and woman in Armenian History 
2 CONC and society. Erato is commemorated by the Marriott Hotel in Yerevan Armenia, as they have called one of their seven meeting venues the Queen Erato Meeting Room after her. Another meeting venue at the 
2 CONC hotel has been named the Tigran Mets Ballroom, named after the Kings of Armenia called Tigranes or Tigran.

2 CONC re available to assist in formatting. (reFill documentation) (February 2015) Athenais Philostorgos II [1] her surname can be spelt as Philostorgus, she is sometimes known as Athenais of Pontus (Greek:
2 CONC  η Άθηναἷς Φιλόστοργος Β' , meaning Athenais the loving one, flourished 51 BCE) was a Princess from the Kingdom of Pontus and through marriage was a Roman Client Queen of Cappadoc
2 CONC ia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athenais was a Princess of Persian and Greek Macedonian ancestry. She was the child of King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his second marriage to the Anatolian Greek Macedonian noblewoman and Pontia
2 CONC n Queen Monime.[2] When Athenais was born, her parents gave her a traditional ancient Greek name. She was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athenais married the Cappadocian Prince and later King Ariobarzanes II Philopator,[3] who was of Persian and Greek descent. Ariobarzanes II succeeded his father as King in 63 BC-62 BC, when his fat
2 CONC her Ariobarzanes I Philoromaios abdicated his throne.[4] When Ariobarzanes II became King, Athenais became Cappadocian Queen and she also inherited the honorific title of Philostorgos, which was the h
2 CONC onorific surname of the mother Ariobarzanes II, Athenais Philostorgos I.[5]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athenais was related to the previous Kings and monarchs of Cappadocia, as her paternal aunt Laodice of Cappadocia was a Queen; her paternal cousins: Ariarathes VI, Ariarathes VII, Ariarathes VIII a
2 CONC nd her paternal half-brother Ariarathes IX served as previous Kings of Cappadocia. Through her Seleucid and paternal lineage, Athenais was related to the ancestors of Ariarathes VI.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ariobarzanes II reigned as King of Cappadocian from 63 BC-62 BC until his assassination in c. 51 BC.[6] There are various surviving honorific inscriptions dedicated to Athenais.[7] During their mar
2 CONC riage Athenais bore Ariobarzanes II two sons: Ariobarzanes III Eusebes Philoromaios and Ariarathes X Eusebes Philadelphos. Her sons would serve as among the last Kings of Cappadocia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The name 'Ariobarzanes' was not just a name that was from her husband’s family, it was a name from her family. Athenais had three paternal political ancestors of that name: Ariobarzanes of Phrygi
2 CONC a (flourished 5th century BC); Ariobarzanes II of Cius (flourished 4th century BC) and the previous Pontian King Ariobarzanes of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of her husband, her first son succeeded his father as King and she became a widow who never married again. Athenais became known as the ‘Queen-Mother’ of Cappadocia.[8]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the rule of Ariobarzanes III, Roman Governor of Cilicia Marcus Tullius Cicero warned the King that Athenais could be a potential enemy to him.[9] Cicero’s warning was based on Athenais’ 
2 CONC jealousy, about two nobles called Methras and Athenaeus. They were ministers and favorites of her first son and they were through Athenais’ jealousy were driven out from the Cappadocian Royal Court.
2 CONC  However Methras and Athenaeus were later recalled by Cicero.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athenais’ jealousy was a part of her failed plot to depose her first son from his throne and put her second son in his place. Cicero and Ariobarzanes III caught Athenais out and Ariobarzanes III 
2 CONC was very saddened about his mother’s actions. Ariabarzanes III removed his mother from power and her fate afterwards is unknown.

2 CONT <p>Mithridates I of Media Atropatene, sometimes known as Mithridates I and Mithridates of Media (100-66 BC) was a King of Media Atropatene.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although Mithridates I was a Median Prince, little is known on his lineage and his life. In or before 67 BC, Mithridates I married an unnamed Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a d

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates I ruled from 67 BC to ca. 66 BC. Mithridates I is mentioned in the ancient sources, in the last campaign against the Roman General Lucullus in 67 BC. He was supporting Tigranes, when hi
2 CONC s father-in-law went to war against the Romans to invade Cappadocia in 67 BC. There is a possibility that Mithridates I was present with Tigranes the Great and the King Mithridates VI of Pontus, when 
2 CONC Tigranes and Mithridates VI were defeated by Lucullus at the Arsanias River in 66 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates I appeared to have died in ca. 66 BC, as his relative Darius I was King of Media Atropatene in c. 65 BC. According to modern genealogies, Mithridates I and his Armenian wife are present
2 CONC ed in being the parents of a child, a son called Ariobarzanes I which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship in opposition to the lasting ruling monarchs of t

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes III (flourished 1st century BC, died before 6 BC[2]) was a Prince of the Kingdom of Armenia and member of the Artaxiad Dynasty who served as a Roman Client King of Armenia from 20-10 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family Background & Early Life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes III was the second son born to Artavasdes II of Armenia by an unnamed mother. Tigranes III had an elder brother called Artaxias II and an unnamed sister who possibly married King Archelaus
2 CONC  of Cappadocia. He was born and raised in Armenia. Tigranes III was the namesake of his paternal grandfather, a previous ruling Armenian King Tigranes the Great, also known as Tigranes II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Life in Roman Captivity & Rise to the Armenian Kingship'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Roman Triumvir Mark Antony had captured Artavasdes II with his family, in which they were taken as political prisoners to Alexandria where Artavasdes II was later executed there on the orders o
2 CONC f Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt. In 34 BC, Artaxias II had escaped and fled to King Phraates IV of Parthia. With the support of Phraates IV, he invaded Armenia and place Artaxias II on 
2 CONC the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sometime after the Battle of Actium in September 31 BC and Octavian (future Roman emperor Augustus) invaded Egypt in 30 BC in which he annexed the country to the rule of the Roman Republic, Tigrane
2 CONC s III was taken from Alexandria to live in Rome. In Rome, Tigranes III had lived in political exile, in which during that time he was educated there. In 20 BC after living in Rome for 10 years, Artaxi
2 CONC as II proved to be an unpopular leader with his people.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As the Armenians lost faith in their ruling monarch, they sent messengers to Augustus requesting him to remove Artaxias II from his throne and to install Tigranes III as his successor. Augustus agr
2 CONC eed to the request from the Armenians. Augustus sent his step-son Tiberius, with Tigranes III with a large army to depose Artaxias II. Before Tiberius and Tigranes III arrived in Armenia, a cabal with
2 CONC in the palace was successful in murdering Artaxias II. The Romans installed Tigranes III as the new King of Armenia unopposed.

2 CONT <p>'''Armenian Kingship'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes III ruled as King of Armenia for 10 years. Although he reigned for a substantial period of time, little is known on his reign. His Armenian kingship brought peace, stability to Armenia in

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tryphaena (Greek: Τρύφαινα; born about 141 BC, died in 111 BC) was a Ptolemaic princess. She married the Seleucid king Antiochus VIII Grypus and was queen of Syria (124-111 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It is often assumed that Tryphaena also bore the name Cleopatra, but this has not been attested. She was the oldest daughter of the Egyptian king Ptolemy VIII Physcon and his niece and wife Cleopat
2 CONC ra III. Therefore, she was the sister of Ptolemy IX Lathyros, Ptolemy X Alexander I, Cleopatra IV and Cleopatra Selene I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 124 BC Ptolemy VIII no longer supported his pretender for the Seleucid throne, Alexander II Zabinas, but Antiochus VIII Grypus, the son of Demetrius II Nicator and Cleopatra Thea. So Ptolemy VII
2 CONC I married his daughter Tryphaena to Antiochus VIII and also sent him reinforcements. The couple had five sons: Seleucus VI Epiphanes, the twin Antiochus XI Epiphanes and Philip I Philadelphus, Demetri
2 CONC us III Eucaerus, and Antiochus XII Dionysus. Tryphaena also bore her husband a daughter called Laodice, who became the wife of Mithridates I Callinicus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 112 BC Antiochus VIII defeated his stepbrother and rival Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, and took Antioch, where Cleopatra IV, the wife of Antiochus IX, stayed. Tryphaena hated her sister Cleopatra IV, 
2 CONC who had taken refuge in the temple of Apollo, and wanted her to be killed. She accused Cleopatra IV of introducing foreign armies into the dispute between the Seleucid stepbrothers and marrying outsid
2 CONC e Egypt against the will of her mother. Antiochus VIII asked his wife in vain to spare her sister. He said that his ancestors had never dealt so violently with women. He added that the temple, where C
2 CONC leopatra IV had taken refuge, was sacred, and that he had to respect the gods, with whose help he had won. But Tryphaena was not to be persuaded by her husband and ordered several soldiers to execute

2 CONT <p>Epiphanes/Callinicus/Philometor, nicknamed Grypus (hook-nose), was crowned as ruler of the Greek Seleucid kingdom in 125 BC. He was the son of Demetrius II Nicator and Cleopatra Thea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus Grypus was crowned as a teenager in 125 BC after his mother Cleopatra Thea had killed his elder brother Seleucus V Philometor, ruling jointly with her. After Antiochus defeated usurper Al
2 CONC exander II Zabinas in 123 BC his mother tried to poison him with wine, but the suspicious king forced her to drink the cup herself. (The story may have been inspired by the fact that Grypus was intere
2 CONC sted in toxicology; some poems about poisonous herbs believed to have been written by him are quoted by the famous physician Galen).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Either he or his half brother Antiochus IX Cyzicenus is probably identical with the ephemeral child ruler Antiochus Epiphanes, who was crowned by Cleopatra Thea after the death of Antiochus VII but
2 CONC  before Demetrius II returned to Antioch. The child Antiochus Epiphanes, who is known from coins, was deposed—but not killed—when Demetrius II was restored in 129 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Despite political shortcomings, Grypus was a popular king. His ugly, lazy appearance on coins (common among the last Seleucids), together with stories of his lavish banquets, made posterity believe
2 CONC  his dynasty was degenerated and decadent. This was however a conscious image, an invocation of the Hellenistic idea Tryphe - meaning good life, which the last Seleucids strove to be associated with, 
2 CONC as opposed to the exhausting civil wars and feuds which troubled their reigns in reality.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A story of his luxurious parties claims he sent food home with guests who attended banquets, complete with a camel as beast of burden, as well as a with attendant to carry the guest himself. This s
2 CONC hould certainly have caused some strain on the already depleted treasury.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He married the Ptolemaic princess Tryphaena, but in 116 BC his half-brother and cousin Antiochus IX Cyzicenus (see Antiochus VII Sidetes) returned from exile and a civil war began. Cyzicenus' wife,
2 CONC  also named Cleopatra, was a sister of Tryphaena and was eventually killed in a dramatic fashion in the temple of Daphne outside Antioch, on the order of Tryphaena. Cyzicenus eventually killed Tryphae
2 CONC na as revenge. The two brothers then divided Syria between them until Grypus was killed by his minister Heracleon in 96 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Five of Grypus' sons later rose to kingship:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p># Seleucus VI Epiphanes</p>
2 CONT <p># Antiochus XI Ephiphanes Philadelphus</p>
2 CONT <p># Philip I Philadelphus</p>
2 CONT <p># Demetrius III Eucaerus</p>
2 CONT <p># Antiochus XII Dionysus</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This contributed to the confusion of civil war amid which the Seleucid empire ended.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He also had at least one daughter:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p># Laodice VII Thea, married to king Mithridates I Callinicus of Commagene as part of a settlement by Mithridates' father Sames II Theosebes Dikaios to ensure peace between the Kingdom of Commagene 
2 CONC and the Seleucid Empire. Laodice and Mithridates' son was king Antiochus I Theos of Commagene. This was a grandson to Grypus.

2 CONC the event[1]:
2 CONT <p> After his triumph against Mithridates (61 BC, September 29 and 30), Pompeius placed the son of Tigranes in chains in the custody of Flavius, a senator. Afterwards when Flavius was praetor, in the 
2 CONC same year in which Clodius was tribune of the plebs (58 BC), Clodius requested him during dinner that he should order Tigranes to be brought in so that he could see him. When Tigranes was brought in h

2 CONT <p>Tigranes II, more commonly known as Tigranes the Great (Armenian: Տիգրան Մեծ, Tigran Mets; Ancient Greek: Τιγράνης ὁ Μέγας Tigránes ho Mégas; Latin: Tigranes Magnus) (140-
2 CONC 55 BC) was King of Armenia under whom the country became, for a short time, the strongest state east of the Roman Republic.[3] He was a member of the Artaxiad Royal House. Under his reign, the Armenia
2 CONC n kingdom expanded beyond its traditional boundaries, allowing Tigranes to claim the title Great King, and involving Armenia in many battles against opponents such as the Parthian and Seleucid empires
2 CONC , and the Roman Republic.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Early years'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes had been a hostage until the age of 45 at the court of King Mithridates II of Parthia after the Armenian defeat in 105 BC. Other sources give the date as much earlier, at around 112-111 BC
2 CONC . After the death of King Tigranes I in 95 BC, Tigranes bought his freedom, according to Strabo, by handing over "seventy valleys" in Atropatene to the Parthians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When he came to power, the foundation upon which Tigranes was to build his Empire was already in place, a legacy of the founder of the Artaxiad Dynasty, Artaxias I, and subsequent kings. The mounta
2 CONC ins of Armenia, however, formed natural borders between the different regions of the country and as a result, the feudalistic nakharars had significant influence over the regions or provinces in which
2 CONC  they were based. This did not suit Tigranes, who wanted to create a centralist empire. He thus proceeded by consolidating his power within Armenia before embarking on his campaign.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He deposed Artanes, the last king of Armenian Sophene and a descendant of Zariadres.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Alliance with Pontus'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the First Mithridatic War (89-85 BC), Tigranes supported Mithridates VI of Pontus but was careful not to become directly involved in the war.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He rapidly built up his power, allying with Mithridates VI of Pontus and marrying his daughter Cleopatra. Tigranes had agreed that he was to extend his influence in the East, while Mithridates was 
2 CONC to conquer Roman land in Asia Minor and in Europe. By creating a stronger Hellenistic state, Mithridates was to contend with the well-established Roman foothold in Europe. Mithridates then put into ef
2 CONC fect a planned a general attack on Roman and Italians in Asia Minor, tapping into local discontent with the Romans and their taxes and urging the peoples of Asia Minor against all foreign influence. 8
2 CONC 0,000 people were slaughtered in the province of Asia Minor, known as the Asiatic Vespers. The two kings' attempts to control Cappadocia and then the massacres resulted in guaranteed Roman interventio
2 CONC n. The senate decided on Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who was then one of the current consuls, to be commander of the army against Mithridates.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Wars against the Parthians and Seleucids'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Mithridates II of Parthia in 88 BC, Tigranes took advantage of the fact that the Parthian Empire had been weakened by Scythian invasions and internal squabbling:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''When he acquired power, he recovered these (seventy) valleys, and devastated the country of the Parthians, the territory about Ninus (Nineveh), and that about Arbela. He subjected to his authorit
2 CONC y the Atropatenians, and the Goryaeans (on the Upper Tigris); by force of arms he obtained possession also of the rest of Mesopotamia and, after crossing the Euphrates, of Syria and Phoenicea. —Stra
2 CONC bo''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 83 BC, after a bloody strife for the throne of Syria, governed by the Seleucids, the Syrians decided to choose Tigranes as the protector of their kingdom and offered him the crown of Syria. Maga
2 CONC dates was appointed as his governor in Antioch. He then conquered Phoenicia and Cilicia, effectively putting an end to the last remnants of the Seleucid Empire, though a few holdout cities appear to h
2 CONC ave recognized the shadowy boy-king Seleucus VII Philometor as the legitimate king during his reign. The southern border of his domain reached as far as Ptolemais (modern Akko). Many of the inhabitant
2 CONC s of conquered cities were sent to his new metropolis of Tigranocerta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At its height, his empire extended from the Pontic Alps (in modern north-eastern Turkey) to Mesopotamia, and from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean. Tigranes apparently invaded territories as fa
2 CONC r away as Ecbatana and took the title king of kings which, at the time, according to their coins, even the Parthian kings did not assume. He was called "Tigranes the Great" by many Western historians 
2 CONC and writers, such as Plutarch. The "King of Kings" never appeared in public without having four kings attending him. Cicero, referring to his success in the east, said that he "made the Republic of Ro
2 CONC me tremble before the prowess of his arms."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes' coin consist of tetradrachms and copper coins having on the obverse his portrait wearing a decorated Armenian tiara with ear-flaps. The reverse has a completely original design. There are
2 CONC  the seated Tyche of Antioch and the river god Orontes at her feet.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Wars against Rome'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates had found refuge in Armenian land after confronting Rome, considering the fact that Tigranes was his ally and relative. The "King of Kings" eventually came into direct contact with Rome
2 CONC . The Roman commander, Lucullus, demanded the expulsion of Mithridates from Armenia – to comply with such a demand would be, in effect, to accept the status of vassal to Rome and this Tigranes refus
2 CONC ed. Charles Rollin, in his Ancient History, says:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Tigranes, to whom Lucullus had sent an ambassador, though of no great power in the beginning of his reign, had enlarged it so much by a series of successes, of which there are few examples, that 
2 CONC he was commonly surnamed "King of Kings." After having overthrown and almost ruined the family of the kings, successors of the great Seleucus; after having very often humbled the pride of the Parthian
2 CONC s, transported whole cities of Greeks into Media, conquered all Syria and Palestine, and given laws to the Arabians called Scenites, he reigned with an authority respected by all the princes of Asia. 
2 CONC The people paid him honors after the manners of the East, even to adoration.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lucullus' reaction was an attack that was so precipitate that he took Tigranes by surprise. According to Roman historians Mithrobazanes, one of Tigranes' generals, told Tigranes of the Roman approa
2 CONC ch. Tigranes was, according to Keaveney, so impressed by Mithrobazanes' courage that he appointed Mithrobazanes to command an army against Lucullus – Mithrobazanes was however defeated and killed. A
2 CONC fter this defeat Tigranes withdrew north to Armenia to regroup which left Lucullus free to put Tigranocerta under siege.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Tigranes had gathered a large army he returned to confront Lucullus. On October 6, 69 BC, Tigranes' much larger force was decisively defeated by the Roman army under Lucullus in the Battle of 
2 CONC Tigranocerta. Tigranes' treatment of the inhabitants (the majority of the population had been forced to move to the city) led disgruntled city guards to open the gates of the city to the Romans. Learn
2 CONC ing of this, Tigranes hurriedly sent 6000 cavalrymen to the city in order to rescue his wives and some of his assets. Tigranes escaped capture with a small escort.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On October 6, 68 BC, the Romans approached the old capital of Artaxata. Tigranes' and Mithridates' combined Armeno-Pontian army of 70,000 men formed up to face them but were resoundingly defeated. 
2 CONC Once again, both Mithridates and Tigranes evaded capture by the victorious Romans. However, the Armenian historians claim that Romans lost the battle of Artaxata and Lucullus' following withdrawal fro
2 CONC m the Kingdom of Armenia in reality was an escape due to the above-mentioned defeat. The Armenian-Roman wars are depicted in Alexandre Dumas' Voyage to the Caucasus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The long campaigning and hardships that Lucullus' troops had endured for years, combined with a perceived lack of reward in the form of plunder, led to successive mutinies among the legions in 68��
2 CONC �67. Frustrated by the rough terrain of Northern Armenia and seeing the worsening morale of his troops, Lucullus moved back south and put Nisibis under siege. Tigranes concluded (wrongly) that Nisibis
2 CONC  would hold out and sought to regain those parts of Armenia that the Romans had captured. Despite his continuous success in battle, Lucullus could still not capture either one of the monarchs. With Lu
2 CONC cullus' troops now refusing to obey his commands, but agreeing to defend positions from attack, the Senate sent Gnaeus Pompey to recall Lucullus to Rome and take over his command.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Pompey and the reconciliation with Rome'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 67 BC Pompey was given the task of defeating Mithridates and Tigranes. Pompey first concentrated on attacking Mithridates while distracting Tigranes by engineering a Parthian attack on Gordyeyne
2 CONC . Phraates III, the Parthian king, was soon persuaded to take things a little further than an annexation of Gordyeyne when a son of Tigranes (also named Tigranes) went to join the Parthians and persua
2 CONC ded Phraates to invade Armenia in an attempt to replace the elder Tigranes with the younger. Tigranes decided not to meet the invasion in the field but instead ensured that his capital, Artaxata, was 
2 CONC well defended and withdrew to the hill country. Phraates soon realized that Artaxata would not fall without a protracted siege, the time for which he could not spare due to his fear of plots at home. 
2 CONC Once Phraates left Tigranes came back down from the hills and drove his son from Armenia. The son then fled to Pompey.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 66 BC, Pompey advanced into Armenia with the younger Tigranes, and Tigranes the Great, now almost 75 years old, surrendered. Pompey treated him generously and allowed him to retain his kingdom s
2 CONC horn of his conquests[21] in return for 6,000 talents/180 tonnes of silver. His unfaithful son was sent back to Rome as a prisoner.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes continued to rule Armenia as an ally of Rome until his death in 55/54.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Halley's comet'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>An ABC News article on May 19, 2004 noted that according to the Armenian and Italian researchers, the "symbol on his crown that features a star with a curved tail may represent the passage of Halle
2 CONC y's Comet in 87 BC." Tigranes could have seen Halley's comet when it passed closest to the Sun on August 6 in 87, according to the researchers, who said the comet would have been a 'most recordable ev
2 CONC ent'– heralding the New Era of the King of Kings.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Legacy'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Over the course of his conquests, Tigranes founded four cities that bore his name, including the capital of Tigranocerta (Tigranakert).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to one count, 24 operas have been composed about Tigranes the Great by European composers, including by prominent Italian and German composers, such as Alessandro Scarlatti (Tigrane, 1715
2 CONC ), Antonio Vivaldi (La virtu trionfante dell'amore e dell'odio ovvero il Tigrane, 1724), Niccolò Piccinni (Tigrane, 1761), Tomaso Albinoni, Giovanni Bononcini, Francesco Gasparini, Pietro Alessandro 
2 CONC Guglielmi, Johann Adolph Hasse, Giovanni Battista Lampugnani, Vincenzo Righini, Antonio Tozzi, etc.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"Sea to sea Armenia" (Armenian: Ծովից ծով Հայաստան Tsovits tsov Hayastan) is a popular expression used by Armenians to refer to the Kingdom of Armenia of Tigranes the Great which ex

2 CONT <p>Thereafter, Tigranes began to enlarge his kingdom, first annexing thekingdom of Sophene (east of the Upper Euphrates River). He also entered into alliance with Mithradates VI Eupator of Pontus, who
2 CONC se daughterCleopatra he married. The interference of the two kings in Cappadocia(in eastern Asia Minor) resulted in successful Roman intervention in 92 BC.
2 CONT <p>Tigranes then began war with the Parthians, whose empire (southeast of the Caspian Sea) was temporarily weakened after the death of Mithradates II (about 87) by internal dissensions and invasions o

2 CONC fered him their crown, and in 78-77 he reoccupied Cappadocia. Tigranes took the title "king of kings" and built a new royal city, Tigranocerta, on the borders of Armeniaand Mesopotamia (the actual sit
2 CONC e is disputed), where he accumulated all his wealth and to which he transplanted the inhabitants of 12 Greektowns of Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Syria.
2 CONT <p>In 72 the Romans forced Mithradates of Pontus to flee to Armenia, and, in 69, Roman armies under Lucullus invaded Armenia. Tigranes was defeated at Tigranocerta on Oct. 6, 69, and again near the fo

2 CONC client-king, though he lost all his conquests except Sophene and Gordyene. He was succeeded by his son Artavasdes II.
2 CONT <p>After the defeat of the Seleucid king Antiochus the Great by Rome at the Battle of Magnesia (winter 190-189 BC), his two Armenian satraps, Artashes (Artaxias) and Zareh (Zariadres), established the

2 CONT <p>Under Tigranes, Armenia ascended to a pinnacle of power unique in itshistory and became, albeit briefly, the strongest state in the Roman east. Extensive territories were taken from the kingdom of

2 CONT <p>Although Armenian culture at the time of Tigranes was Iranian, as it had been and as it was fundamentally to remain for many centuries, Hellenic scholars and actors found a welcome at the Armenian

2 CONT <p>Tigranes II THE GREAT, Tigranes also spelled TIGRAN, or DIKRAN (b. c.140--d. c. 55 BC), king of Armenia from 95 to 55 BC, under whom the country became for a short time the strongest state in the R
2 CONC oman East.
2 CONT <p>Tigranes was the son or brother of Artavasdes I and a member of the dynasty founded in the early 2nd century by Artaxias. He was given as ahostage to the Parthian king Mithradates II, but later he 
2 CONC purchased his freedom by ceding 70 valleys bordering on Media, in northwestern Iran.
2 CONT <p>Thereafter, Tigranes began to enlarge his kingdom, first annexing thekingdom of Sophene (east of the Upper Euphrates River). He also entered into alliance with Mithradates VI Eupator of Pontus, who
2 CONC se daughterCleopatra he married. The interference of the two kings in Cappadocia(in eastern Asia Minor) resulted in successful Roman intervention in 92 BC.
2 CONT <p>Tigranes then began war with the Parthians, whose empire (southeast of the Caspian Sea) was temporarily weakened after the death of Mithradates II (about 87) by internal dissensions and invasions o
2 CONC f the Scythians. Tigranes reconquered the valleys he had ceded and laid waste a great part of Media; the kings of Atropatene (Azerbaijan), Gordyene andAdiabene (both on the Upper Tigris River), and Os
2 CONC roene became his vassals. He also annexed northern Mesopotamia, and in the Caucasus the kings of Iberia and Albania accepted his suzerainty. In 83 the Syrians, tired of Seleucid dynastic struggles, of
2 CONC fered him their crown, and in 78-77 he reoccupied Cappadocia. Tigranes took the title "king of kings" and built a new royal city, Tigranocerta, on the borders of Armeniaand Mesopotamia (the actual sit
2 CONC e is disputed), where he accumulated all his wealth and to which he transplanted the inhabitants of 12 Greektowns of Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Syria.
2 CONT <p>In 72 the Romans forced Mithradates of Pontus to flee to Armenia, and, in 69, Roman armies under Lucullus invaded Armenia. Tigranes was defeated at Tigranocerta on Oct. 6, 69, and again near the fo
2 CONC rmer capital of Artaxata in September 68. The recall of Lucullus gave some respite to Mithradates and Tigranes, but in the meantime a son of Tigranes,also called Tigranes, rebelled against him. Althou
2 CONC gh the younger Tigranes was given an army by the Parthian king Phraates III, he was defeated by his father and was forced to flee to the Roman general Pompey. When Pompey advanced into Armenia, Tigran
2 CONC es surrendered (66 BC). Pompey received him graciously and gave him back his kingdom (in exchange for Syria and other southern conquests). Tigranes ruled about 10 yearslonger over Armenia, as a Roman 
2 CONC client-king, though he lost all his conquests except Sophene and Gordyene. He was succeeded by his son Artavasdes II.
2 CONT <p>After the defeat of the Seleucid king Antiochus the Great by Rome at the Battle of Magnesia (winter 190-189 BC), his two Armenian satraps, Artashes (Artaxias) and Zareh (Zariadres), established the
2 CONC mselves, with Roman consent, as kings of Greater Armenia and Sophene, respectively, thus becoming the creators of an independent Armenia. Artashes built his capital Artashat (Artaxata) on the Aras Riv
2 CONC er near modern Yerevan. The Greek geographer Strabo names the capital of Sophene as Carcathiocerta. An attempt to end the division of Armenia into an eastern and a western part was made about 165 BC w
2 CONC hen the Artaxiad ruler soughtto suppress his rival, but it was left to his descendant Tigranes II the Great (95-55 BC) to establish, by his conquest of Sophene, a unitythat was to last almost 500 year
2 CONC s.
2 CONT <p>Under Tigranes, Armenia ascended to a pinnacle of power unique in itshistory and became, albeit briefly, the strongest state in the Roman east. Extensive territories were taken from the kingdom of 
2 CONC Parthia in Iran, which was compelled to sign a treaty of alliance. Iberia (Georgia), Albania, and Atropatene had already accepted Tigranes' suzerainty when the Syrians, tired of anarchy, offered him t

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes the Great (ruled 95 BC-56 BC) (also called Tigranes II and sometimes Tigranes I) was a king of Armenia. He was the son of Artavasdes I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Around 100 BC the Parthians placed him on the throne of Armenia, in return for "seventy valleys" in Armenia (Strabo 11.14.15). He rapidly built up his power, allying with Mithridates VI of Pontus a
2 CONC nd marrying his daughter Cleopatra. Ultimately the two kings' attempts to control Cappadocia resulted in Roman intervention, in the person of Lucius Cornelius Sulla.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes also expanded his domain into Parthia, going into Media as far as Ecbatana and to Arbela in Assyria, capturing northern Mesopotamia. In 83 BC he took over Syria, Phoenicia, and Cilicia, ef
2 CONC fectively putting an end to the Seleucid dynasty. Many of the inhabitants of conquered cities were sent to his new metropolis Tigranocerta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But his empire was not a lasting one. In 69 BC he warred with Rome, eventually losing Tigranocerta to Lucullus and being separated from Mithridates by Pompey in 66 BC. Tigranes' son went over to Po
2 CONC mpey, and as they approached Artaxata, Tigranes himself surrendered, gave up all his territories except Armenia, and finished out his life as a tributary of Rome.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artavasdes II (Ancient Greek: ΒΑΣΙΛΕΟΣ ΑΡΤΑΥΑΖΔΟΥ Basileos Artavazdou, Armenian: Արտավազդ Երկրորդ Artavazd Ikrord) was a King of the Kingdom of Armenia from 54-34 B
2 CONC C and a member of the Artaxiad Dynasty. He succeeded his father, Tigranes the Great, also known as Tigranes II. Artavasdes II was an ally of Rome, but when Orodes II of Parthia invaded Armenia followi
2 CONC ng his victory over the Roman general Marcus Licinius Crassus at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, he was forced to join the Parthians. He gave his sister in marriage to Orodes' son and heir Pacorus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 36 BC the Roman General Mark Antony invaded Armenia and Artavasdes II again switched sides, but abandoned the Romans once they had left Armenia to conquer Atropatene. In 34 BC Antony planned a n
2 CONC ew invasion of Armenia. First he sent his friend Quintus Dellius, who offered a betrothal of Antony's six-year-old son Alexander Helios to a daughter of Artavasdes II, but the Armenian king hesitated.
2 CONC  Now the triumvir marched into the Roman western Armenia. He summoned Artavasdes II to Nicopolis, allegedly to prepare a new war against Parthia. Artavasdes II didn't come, so the Roman general quickl
2 CONC y marched to the Armenian capital Artaxata. He arrested the king, hoping that with his hostages assistance to obtain great treasures in the Armenian castles. His son Artaxias II was elected as success
2 CONC or. After a lost battle Artaxias II fled to the Parthian king. Finally Antony took Artavasdes II to Alexandria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Armenian king and his family, who were bound with golden chains, had to follow Antony in his triumphal procession. Cleopatra VII of Egypt awaited the triumvir on a golden throne, but Artavasdes
2 CONC  II refused to render homage to the Egyptian Queen by Proskynesis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Battle of Actium 31 BC, the Armenian king was executed by beheading at the behest of Cleopatra. In the past he had been an enemy of his namesake, King Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, wh
2 CONC o had become an ally of Antony. She sent his head to Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene to secure his help.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Plutarch describes Artavasdes II as a well educated man, who had a great fondness for all things Greek and was an accomplished scholar who composed Greek tragedies and histories. From an unnamed wi

2 CONC dest son Ptolemy IX. According to Strabo she was sometimes known as Cleopatra Kokke when discussed in relation to her son Ptolemy X.

2 CONT <p>Cleopatra III’s uncle Ptolemy VIII of Egypt ruled together with her parents from ca 170 to 164 BC at which point he expelled Cleopatra II and Ptolemy VI of Egypt. But he was soon forced to abdica
2 CONC te. Cleopatra III’s parents retook the throne and remained in power for almost 20 years until 145 BC. It was during this time that Cleopatra III was born (sometime between 160 and 155 BC), a sister 
2 CONC of Ptolemy Eupator, Cleopatra Thea and possibly Berenice.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of her father Ptolemy VI from injuries sustained when falling from his horse during the battle of Oinoparas against Alexander Balas, Cleopatra III’s uncle Ptolemy VIII became the

2 CONT <p>'''Joint rule with her mother and husband'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy VIII first married Cleopatra III’s mother Cleopatra II in 145 BC, and married Cleopatra III in c. 139 BC. Cleopatra II rebelled against Ptolemy VIII in c. 132 BC and Cleopatra III fled to
2 CONC  Cyprus in 130 BC with her husband, but was able to return to Alexandria in 127 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cleopatra III and Ptolemy VIII had five children:</p>

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cleopatra Thea (c. 164 BC - 121 BC) surnamed Euergetis (i.e., "Benefactress") was a daughter of Ptolemy VI of Egypt and Cleopatra II of Egypt. She ruled Seleucid Syria from 125 BC to 121 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>She married Alexander Balas in about 150 BC. This union produced Antiochus VI Dionysus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Her second marriage was to Demetrius II Nicator in about 148 BC. Their children were Seleucus V Philometor, Antiochus VIII Grypus, and possibly a daughter (Laodice?). Demetrius was captured fightin
2 CONC g against the Parthians and was consequently off the scene for a while.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Her third husband, married during Demetrius' captivity, was his brother Antiochus VII Sidetes. They certainly had Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, but the names of any other children are uncertain. In about
2 CONC  129 BC, Antiochus was killed fighting the Parthians. Demetrius had been released and returned home to reclaim his throne and queen. Cleopatra had taken the precaution of sending Antiochus IX (her son
2 CONC  by Antiochus VII) to Cyzicus in Asia Minor (hence his surname).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius unsuccessfully attempted to invade Egypt. In retaliation, the ruler of Egypt put forward Alexander Zabinas, allegedly a son of Alexander Balas as king of Syria, provoking civil war. After
2 CONC  a defeat by Zabinas' forces at Damascus, Demetrius retreated to Ptolemais Hermiou only to find the city gates closed against him by Cleopatra. He boarded a ship to flee, but was killed on Cleopatra's
2 CONC  orders.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From 125 BC to 121 BC, Cleopatra ruled Syria, killing Demetrius' eldest son Seleucus when he attempted to claim the throne. To legitimize her reign, she shared the throne with her son Antiochus VII
2 CONC I Grypus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus became less controllable as he grew up and in 121 BC, she decided to eliminate him. As he returned from a hunt one day, she offered him a cup of wine. Since this was not common behavior f
2 CONC or her, Antiochus was suspicious and forced her to drink the wine, with the predictable outcome.

2 CONT <p>Cleopatra III (Greek: ??e?p?t?a, 161–101 BC) was queen of Egypt 142–101 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>She was born in 161 BC to Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II of Egypt. Ptolemy VII Neos Philopater was her brother. After the death of her father, her brother became the King of Egypt, and her mother was 
2 CONC regent. In an attempt to gain control of Cleopatra II, Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II "Physcon" married her. Physcon later had Philopater killed, thus taking the throne for himself.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He then discarded Cleopatra II and married Cleopatra III in 142 BC, making her Queen and joint ruler. His reign after that was peaceful, but he was very despotic. She bore Physcon these children: P
2 CONC tolemy IX Philometor Soter II Lathyros, Ptolemy X Alexander I, Cleopatra IV, Cleopatra V Tryphaena, and Cleopatra Selene.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When he died, he left the throne to Cleopatra and whichever son she wished. If it were up to her, she would have chosen her younger son Alexander, but the Alexandrians forced her to bring Lathyros 
2 CONC from Cyprus, of which he was governor, to co-rule, becoming Ptolemy IX. The younger son Alexander was then sent to Cyprus to fill Lathyros's former position.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Eventually, by accusing Lathyros of murdering her, she successfully deposed him and brought Alexander back to Egypt, becoming Ptolemy X. However, she eventually tired of Alexander and brought back 
2 CONC Lathyros. Again, she grew tired of Lathyros as well, and Alexander was brought back. Tiring of his mother's intrigue, Alexander had her assassinated in 101 BC.

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Εὐεργέτης, Ptolemaĩos Euergétēs) (c. 182 BC – June 26, 116 BC), nicknamed Φύσκων, Phúskōn, Physcon ("Sausage", "Potbel
2 CONC ly" or "Bladder") for his obesity, was a king of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. His complicated career started in 170 BC, when Antiochus IV Epiphanes invaded Egypt, captured his brother Ptolemy VI Ph
2 CONC ilometor and let him continue as a puppet monarch. Then Alexandria chose Ptolemy Euergetes as king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Antiochus left (169 BC), Euergetes agreed to joint rule with his older brother Ptolemy VI Philometor and Cleopatra II. This arrangement led to continuous intrigues, lasting until October 164 
2 CONC BC, when Philometor went to Rome to gain support from the Senate, who were a little helpful, but Physcon's sole rule was not popular, and in May 163 BC the two brothers agreed to a partition that left
2 CONC  Physcon in charge of Cyrenaica.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although the arrangement lasted until Philometor's death in 145 BC, it did not end the sparring. Physcon convinced the Senate to back his claim on Cyprus, but Philometor ignored this, and after Phy

2 CONC  Physcon went to Rome, displayed the scars of wounds he received in the attempt, and despite the opposition of Cato the Elder, received the Senate's support and some resources for another attempt on C
2 CONC yprus. (An inscription records that Physcon had bequeathed Cyrenaica to Rome if he died childless, an act not mentioned by any literary source.)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The second attempt on Cyprus also failed, and Philometor captured Physcon, but spared him, offering him the hand of his daughter Cleopatra Thea, and sent him back to Cyrenaica.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Philometor died on campaign in 145 BC, Cleopatra II had her son proclaimed Ptolemy VII, but Physcon returned, proposed joint rule and marriage to Cleopatra II, his sister. He then had the unlu
2 CONC cky youth assassinated during the wedding feast. He then took the throne as "Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II", the name deliberately recalling his ancestor Ptolemy III Euergetes, and had himself proclaimed 
2 CONC as pharaoh in 144 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Physcon took his revenge on the intellectuals of Alexandria who had opposed him, engaging in mass purges and expulsions that included Aristarchus of Samothrace and Apollodorus, leaving Alexandria a
2 CONC  changed city. In 145 BC, "he expelled all intellectuals: philologists, philosophers, professors of geometry, musicians, painters, schoolteachers, physicians and others, with the result that these bro
2 CONC ught 'education to Greeks and barbarians elsewhere,' as mentioned by an author who may have been one of the king's victims" (Menecles of Barca, FGrHist 270 F 9).[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He then seduced and married Cleopatra III (who was his wife's daughter) without divorcing Cleopatra II, who was infuriated, and by 132 BC or 131 BC, the people of Alexandria rioted and set fire to 
2 CONC the royal palace. Physcon, Cleopatra III, and their children escaped to Cyprus, while Cleopatra II had their twelve-year-old son Ptolemy Memphitis acclaimed as king. Physcon was however able to get ho
2 CONC ld of the boy and killed him, sending the dismembered pieces to Cleopatra.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The ensuing civil war pitted Cleopatra's Alexandria against the countryside, who supported Physcon. Cleopatra offered the throne of Egypt to Demetrius II Nicator, but he got no further than Pelusiu

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After further intrigues, Cleopatra II ended up back in Egypt in 124 BC, and about this time Physcon sent his second daughter by Cleopatra III, Cleopatra Tryphaena, to marry Antiochus VIII Philometo

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Εὐεργέτης, Ptolemaĩos Euergétēs) (c. 182 BC-June 26, 116 BC), nicknamed Physcon (Φύσκων), was a king of the Ptolemaic dyna
2 CONC sty in Egypt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Origins'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy VIII's complicated political career started in 170 BC. This is when Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Seleucid Empire invaded and captured King Ptolemy VI Philometor and all of Egypt, with the 
2 CONC exception of the city of Alexandria. Antiochus allowed Ptolemy VI to continue as a puppet monarch. Meanwhile, the people of Alexandria chose Ptolemy Euergetes, his younger brother, as king. Euergetes 
2 CONC was popularly known as "Physkōn", Latinized as Physcon, meaning sausage, potbelly or bladder, due to his obesity. Instead of taking up arms against one another, the brothers decided to co-rule Egypt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Antiochus' withdrawal and the joint rule'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Antiochus withdrew from the area in 168 BC due to threats from Rome, Physcon agreed to jointly rule Egypt in a triumvirate with Philometor and Cleopatra II (Philometor's wife and their sister
2 CONC ). This arrangement led to continuous intrigues, lasting until October 164 BC, when Philometor traveled to Rome to appear before the Senate, who were somewhat agreeable with the arrangement. However, 
2 CONC areas under Physcon's sole rule were not satisfied with the arrangement, and in May 163 BC the two brothers agreed to an altering of the original partition. This left Physcon in charge of Cyrenaica.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although the arrangement lasted until Philometor's death in 145 BC, it did not end the power struggles.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Designs on Cyprus'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Physcon convinced the Roman Senate to back his claims on Cyprus, but Philometor opposed this. Physcon's attempt to conquer the island failed (161 BC) and the Senate sent Philometor's ambassadors ho

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Assassination attempt''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 156 or 155 BC, Philometor tried to have Physcon assassinated but failed. Physcon went to Rome, displaying the scars he had received in the attempt. Despite opposition from Cato the Elder (an all
2 CONC y of Philometor), he received the Senate's support and further resources for another attempt on Cyprus. During his time in Rome he met Cornelia Africana (who had been recently widowed following the de
2 CONC ath of her husband, Tiberius Gracchus Major), and asked for her hand in marriage, which she refused.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The second attempt on Cyprus also failed. Philometor captured and held Physcon prisoner, but spared him; offering him instead the hand of his daughter, Cleopatra Thea, and sent them back to Cyrenai
2 CONC ca.

2 CONT <p>'''Marriage to Cleopatra II'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Philometor died on a campaign in 145 BC, Cleopatra II quickly had her son proclaimed King Ptolemy VII. Physcon, however, returned from battle and proposed joint rule and marriage with Cleopatr

2 CONC estor Ptolemy III Euergetes), and had himself proclaimed pharaoh in 144 BC.

2 CONT <p>'''Revenge and intrigues'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 145 BC, Physcon took his revenge on the intellectuals of Alexandria who had opposed him, including Aristarchus of Samothrace and Apollodorus of Athens. He engaged in mass purges and expulsions, 
2 CONC leaving Alexandria a changed city.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''"He expelled all intellectuals: philologists, philosophers, professors of geometry, musicians, painters, schoolteachers, physicians and others, with the result that these brought 'education to Gr
2 CONC eeks and barbarians elsewhere,' as mentioned by an author who may have been one of the king's victims" —Menecles of Barca.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Physcon seduced and married Cleopatra III (his wife's daughter) without divorcing Cleopatra II, who became infuriated. Many speculate that Physcon only married Cleopatra II because he was plotting 
2 CONC to marry Cleopatra III when she became of marrying age. By 132 or 131 BC, the people of Alexandria had rioted and set fire to the royal palace. Physcon, Cleopatra III, and their children escaped to Cy
2 CONC prus; while Cleopatra II had their twelve-year-old son, Ptolemy Memphitis, acclaimed as king. Physcon was able to get hold of the boy, killed him, and sent the dismembered pieces back to Cleopatra.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Civil war'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The ensuing civil war pitted Cleopatra's city of Alexandria against the rest of the country, who supported Physcon. Growing desperate, Cleopatra offered the throne of Egypt to the Seleucid king Dem
2 CONC etrius II Nicator, but his forces could get no further than Pelusium. By 127 BC, Cleopatra fled to Syria. Alexandria held out for another year. After further political maneuvering, Cleopatra II did en
2 CONC d up back in Egypt in 124 BC. A formal amnesty decree followed in 118 BC, but it was insufficient to improve the government's relationship with the whole country. The Romans were forced to intervene i
2 CONC n Egypt 116 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Later rule'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>About 124 BC, Physcon sent his second daughter by Cleopatra III, Tryphaena, to marry Antiochus VIII Philometor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Physcon died in 116 BC. He left the throne to Cleopatra III and one of her sons, whichever she preferred. She wished to have her younger son, Alexander, reign with her; but the people of Alexandria
2 CONC  wanted her older son, Philometer Soter, the governor of Cyprus, to be her choice. She reluctantly complied, with Philometer Soter taking the name "Ptolemy IX" and ruling for a time at her side.

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    Numbering the Ptolemies is a modern invention; the Greeks distinguished them by nickname. The number given here is the present consensus; but there has been some disagreement about which Ptolem
2 CONC ies should be counted as reigning. Older sources may give a number one higher or lower, but the same epithet.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II (Greek: ?t??eµa??? ??e???t??) (c. 182 BC – 26 June 116 BC), nicknamed Physcon ("Potbelly" or "Bladder") for his obesity, was a king of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. H
2 CONC is complicated career started in 170 BC, when Antiochus IV Epiphanes invaded Egypt and installed the young Euergetes as king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Antiochus left (169), Euergetes agreed to joint rule with his older brother Ptolemy VI Philometor and Cleopatra II. This arrangement led to continuous intrigues, lasting until October 164, wh
2 CONC en Philometor went to Rome to gain support from the Senate, who were a little helpful, but Physcon's sole rule was not popular, and in May 163 the two brothers agreed to a partition that left Physcon 
2 CONC in charge of Cyrenaica.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although the arrangement lasted until Philometor's death in 145, it did not end the sparring. Physcon convinced the Senate to back his claim on Cyprus, but Philometor ignored this, and after Physco
2 CONC n's attempt to conquer the island failed, in 161 the Senate sent Philometor's ambassadors home. Sometime around 156/155 Philometor tried to have Physcon assassinated, but this failed, and Physcon went
2 CONC  to Rome, displayed the scars of wounds he received in the attempt, and despite the opposition of Cato the Elder, received the Senate's support and some resources for another attempt on Cyprus. (An in
2 CONC scription records that Physcon had bequeathed Cyrenaica to Rome if he died childless, an act not mentioned by any literary source.)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The second attempt on Cyprus also failed, and Philometor captured Physcon, but spared him, offering him the hand of his daughter Cleopatra Thea, and sent him back to Cyrenaica.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Philometor died on campaign in 145, Cleopatra II had her son proclaimed Ptolemy VII, but Physcon returned, proposed joint rule and marriage to Cleopatra II. He then had the unlucky youth assas
2 CONC sinated during the wedding feast. He then took the throne as "Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II", the name deliberately recalling his ancestor Ptolemy III Euergetes, and had himself proclaimed as pharaoh in 1
2 CONC 44.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Physcon took his revenge on the Jews and intellectuals of Alexandria who had opposed him, engaging in mass purges and expulsions that included Aristarchus of Samothrace and Apollodorus, leaving Ale
2 CONC xandria a changed city.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He then seduced and married Cleopatra III without divorcing Cleopatra II, who was infuriated, and by 132 or 131, the people of Alexandria rioted and set fire to the royal palace. Physcon, Cleopatra
2 CONC  III, and their children escaped to Cyprus, while Cleopatra II had his 12-year-old son, Ptolemy Memphitis acclaimed as king. Physcon was however able to get hold of the boy and killed him, sending the
2 CONC  dismembered pieces to Cleopatra.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The ensuing civil war pitted Cleopatra's Alexandria against the countryside, who supported Physcon. Cleopatra offered the throne of Egypt to Demetrius II Nicator, but he got no further than Pelusiu
2 CONC m, and by 127 Cleopatra left for Syria, leaving Alexandria to hold out for another year.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After further intrigues, Cleopatra II ended up back in Egypt in 124 BC, and about this time Physcon sent his second daughter by Cleopatra III, Cleopatra Tryphaena, to marry Antiochus VIII Philometo
2 CONC r. A formal amnesty decree followed in 118 BC, but it was insufficient to improve government, and the Romans would soon be forced to intervene after his death in 116.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When he died, he left the throne to Cleopatra III and one of her sons, whichever she preferred. She would have chosen her younger son Alexander to have reigned with her. However, the Alexandrians w
2 CONC anted her older son Philometer Soter, governor of Cyprus, to co-reign. She reluctantly complied, with Philometer taking the name Ptolemy IX, though her younger son would rule at one point.

2 CONT <p>Demetrius II (Greek: Δημήτριος Β' d. 125 BCE), called Nicator (Greek: "Νικάτωρ", i.e. "Victor"), was one of the sons of Demetrius I Soter, brother of Antiochus VII Sidetes and his

2 CONT <p>Demetrius II (Ancient Greek: Δημήτριος Β`, Dēmḗtrios B; died 125 BC), called Nicator (Ancient Greek: Νικάτωρ, Nikátōr, "the Victor"), was one of the sons of Demetrius I Soter,
2 CONC  brother of Antiochus VII Sidetes and his mother could have been Laodice V. He ruled the Seleucid Empire for two periods, separated by a number of years of captivity in Hyrcania in Parthia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''In exile'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a young boy, he fled to Crete after the death of his father, his mother and his older brother, when Alexander Balas usurped the Seleucid throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''First reign'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>About 147 BC he returned to Syria, and with the backing of Ptolemy VI Philometor, king of Egypt, regained his father's throne. The Egyptian king also divorced his daughter Cleopatra Thea from Balas
2 CONC  and remarried her to Demetrius. Alexander fled to the Nabateans who, anxious to stay on good terms with Egypt, cut off his head.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, Demetrius was not a popular king. The people of Syria had little respect for the young boy, who had come to power with the help of Egypt and Cretan mercenaries led by the ruthless condotti
2 CONC ere Lasthenes. The Antiochenians offered the Seleucid throne to Ptolemy VI, who had already conquered most of southern Syria for his own interest. However, he insisted Demetrius would become king, kno
2 CONC wing that Rome would never tolerate a unified Hellenistic state, and the year after Ptolemy VI was killed when Alexander Balas made a last desperate attempt to regain his throne. The Egyptian troops m
2 CONC arched home, leaderless and disillusioned, and with Balas dead as well Demetrius became sole master of the Seleucid kingdom.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But new troubles soon arose. The pillaging of the Cretan soldiers caused the Antiochenians to rise in rebellion, and only after terrible massacres was order restored. Soon after, the general Diodot
2 CONC us conquered Antioch and had his protégé Antiochus VI Dionysus, the infant son of Alexander Balas, proclaimed king. Demetrius proved unable to retake the capital, instead establishing himself in Sel
2 CONC eucia. Diodotus had Antiochus VI deposed a few years later, and made himself king as Tryphon, but the division of the kingdom between the legitimate Seleucid heir and the usurper in Antioch persisted.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Defeat and captivity'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 139 BC Parthian activity forced Demetrius to take action. He marched against Mithradates I, king of Parthia and was initially successful, but was defeated in the Iranian mountains and taken pris
2 CONC oner the following year. The Babylonian province of the Seleucid empire became Parthian, but in Syria was the dynasty's grip was reassured under Antiochus VII Sidetes, the younger brother of Demetrius
2 CONC , who also married Cleopatra Thea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>King Mithradates had kept Demetrius II alive and even married him to a Parthian princess named Rhodogune, with whom he had children. However, Demetrius was restless and twice tried to escape from h
2 CONC is exile in Hyrcania on the shores of the Caspian sea, once with the help of his friend Kallimander, who had gone to great lengths to rescue the king: he had travelled incognito through Babylonia and 
2 CONC Parthia. When the two friends were captured, the Parthian king did not punish Kallimander but rewarded him for his fidelity to Demetrius. The second time Demetrius was captured when he tried to escape
2 CONC , Mithradates humiliated him by giving him a golden set of dice, thus hinting that Demetrius II was a restless child who needed toys. It was however for political reasons that the Parthians treated De
2 CONC metrius II kindly.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 130 BC Antiochus Sidetes felt secure enough to march against Parthia, and scored massive initial successes. Now Phraates II made what he thought was a powerful move: he released Demetrius, hopin
2 CONC g that the two brothers would start a civil war. However, Sidetes was defeated soon after his brother's release and never met him. Phraates II set people to pursue Demetrius, but he managed to safely 
2 CONC return home to Syria and regained his throne and his queen as well.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''A failed second reign'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, the Seleucid kingdom was now but a shadow of its former glory, and Demetrius had a hard time ruling even in Syria. Recollections of his cruelties and vices – along with his humiliating d
2 CONC efeat – caused him to be greatly detested. The Egyptian queen Cleopatra II set up an army for Demetrius, hoping to engage him in her civil wars against her brother king Ptolemy VIII, but this only a

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius II (d. 125 BC), called Nicator (Victor), was the middle son of Demetrius I Soter. As a young boy, he fled to Crete after the death of his father, his mother and his older brother, when Al
2 CONC exander Balas usurped the Seleucid throne. About 147 BC he returned to Syria, and with the help of Ptolemy VI Philometor, king of Egypt, regained his father's throne. The Egyptian king also divorced h
2 CONC is daughter Cleopatra Thea from Balas and remarried her to Demetrius. Alexander fled to Cilicia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, Demetrius was not a popular king. The people of Syria had little respect for the young boy, who had come to power with the help of Egypt and Cretan mercenaries led by the ruthless condotti
2 CONC er Lasthenes. The Antiochenians offered the Seleucid throne to Ptolemy VI, who had already conquered most of southern Syria for his own interest. However, he insisted Demetrius would become king, know
2 CONC ing that Rome would never tolerate a unified hellenistic state, and the year after Ptolemy VI was killed when Alexander Balas made a last desperate attempt to regain his throne. The Egyptian troops ma
2 CONC rched home, leaderless and disillusioned, and with Balas dead as well Demetrius became sole master of the Seleucid kingdom.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But new troubles soon arose. The pillaging of the Cretan soldiers caused the Antiochenians to rise in rebellion, and only after terrible massacres could order be restored. Soon after, the general D
2 CONC iodotus conquered Antioch and had his protegé Antiochus VI Dionysus, the infant son of Alexander Balas, proclaimed king. Demetrius proved unable to retake the capital,instead establishing himself in 
2 CONC Seleucia. Diodotus had Antiochus VI deposed a few years later, and made himself King as Tryphon, but the division of the kingdom between the legitimate Seleucid heir and the usurper in Antioch persist
2 CONC ed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Defeat and captivity</p>
2 CONT <p>In 139 BCE Parthian activity forced Demetrius to take action. He marched against Mithradates I, king of Parthia and was initially successful, but was defeated in the Iranian mountains and taken pri
2 CONC soner the following year. The Babylonian province of the Seleucid empire became Parthian, but in Syria was the dynasty's grip was reassured under Antiochus VII Sidetes, the younger brother of Demetriu
2 CONC s, who also married Cleopatra Thea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>King Mithradates had kept Demetrius II alive and even married him to a Parthian princess named Rhodogune, with whom he had children. However, Demetrius was restless and twice tried to escape from h
2 CONC is exile on the shores of the Caspian sea, once with the help of his friend Kallimander, who had gone to great lengths to rescue the king: he had travelled incognito through Babylonia and Parthia. Whe
2 CONC n the two friends were captured, the Parthian king did not punish Kallimander but rewarded him for his fidelity to Demetrius. The second time Demetrius was captured when he tried to escape, Mithradate
2 CONC s humiliated him by giving him a golden set of dice, thus hinting that Demetrius II was a restless child who needed toys. It was however for political reasons that the Parthians treated Demetrius II k
2 CONC indly.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 130 BCE Antiochus Sidetes felt secure enough to march against Parthia, and scored massive initial successes. Now Mithradates released what he thought was a powerful move: he released Demetrius, 
2 CONC hoping that the two brothers would start a civil war. However, Sidetes was defeated soon after his brother's release and never met him. Mithradates set people to pursue Demetrius, but he could return 
2 CONC safely home to Syria to regain his throne and his queen as well.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>A failed second reign</p>
2 CONT <p>However, the Seleucid kingdom was now but a shadow of its former glory, and Demetrius had a hard time to rule even in Syria. Recollections of his cruelties and vices - along with his humiliating de
2 CONC feat - caused him to be greatly detested. The Egyptian queen Cleopatra II set up an army for Demetrius, hoping to engage him in her civil wars against her brother king Ptolemy VIII, but this only adde
2 CONC d to his grief. The troops soon deserted, and king Ptolemy VIII reacted by setting up yet another usurper, a man named Alexander II Zabinas against Demetrius.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 126 BCE Demetrius was defeated in a battle at Damascus, and killed on a ship near Tyre, after his wife Cleopatra Thea had deserted him. His miserable death - he was captured and possibly torture

2 CONT <p>Cleopatra Thea (Greek: Κλεοπάτρα Θεά, which means "Cleopatra the Goddess"; c. 164 – 121 BC) surnamed Eueteria (i.e., "good-harvest/fruitful season") was the ruler of the Hellenistic S
2 CONC eleucid Empire. She ruled Syria from 125 BC after the death of Demetrius II Nicator. She eventually ruled in co-regency with her son Antiochus VIII Grypus, who poisoned her in 121 or 120 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cleopatra Thea grew up in Egypt as the daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. She was probably born ca. 164 BC. She may have been engaged to her uncle Ptolemy VIII king of Cyrene in 154, but he e
2 CONC ventually married her sister Cleopatra III. In 150 BC she married Alexander Balas in a sumptuous ceremony at Ptolemais Akko. The marriage produced a son named Antiochus VI Dionysus. In 145 BC her fath
2 CONC er invaded Syria, defeated Alexander Balas in battle and remarried her to Demetrius II, only to die a few days later. Demetrius set himself up as co-ruler with the young boy Antiochus VI, but may have
2 CONC  killed him in 142 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 139 BC Demetrius II was captured fighting against the Parthians and was held prisoner by them until 129 BC. After Demetrius was captured, his younger brother, Antiochus VII Sidetes, who was rais
2 CONC ed in the city of Side in Pamphylia, came to Syria and took the throne, marrying Cleopatra Thea in 138 BC. Cleopatra Thea bore him at least one son, Antiochus IX Cyzicenus. The names of any other chil
2 CONC dren are uncertain.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 129 BC, the Parthians released Demetrius II, as a political manoeuvre against Sidetes, to claim his throne and his wife. That same year Sidetes was killed fighting the Parthians. Cleopatra had t
2 CONC aken the precaution of sending Antiochus IX (her son by Antiochus VII) to Cyzicus in Asia Minor (hence his surname). Demetrius returned home and regained his throne, taking Cleopatra Thea as his wife 
2 CONC by his side.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 132/131 BC Cleopatra Thea's mother, Cleopatra II of Egypt rebelled against her brother Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II Tryphon. In 127 BC Cleopatra II fled to her son-in-law Demetrius' court in Syria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius' elder son, Seleucus, became king with the name Seleucus V in 125 BC; however, his mother, Cleopatra Thea, had him murdered soon after. From 125 BC to 121 BC, Cleopatra ruled Syria and to
2 CONC  legitimize her reign, she shared the throne with her son, Antiochus VIII Grypus. Antiochus VIII was married to Tryphaena, the daughter of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Grypus became less controllable as he grew up and in 121 BC Cleopatra Thea decided to eliminate him. As he returned from a hunt one day, she offered him a cup of wine. Since this was not common beh
2 CONC avior for her, Grypus was suspicious and forced her to drink the wine, which killed her.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Grypus re-organised the state and for the next eight years he provided stability and financial recovery. This period would end ca. 114 BC, when Cleopatra Thea's other son, Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, r
2 CONC eturned to Syria to claim the throne and civil war started again.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cleopatra Thea was a daughter of Ptolemy VI of Egypt and Cleopatra II. She had two brothers named Ptolemy Eupator and Ptolemy respectively. Her sister Cleopatra III was Queen of Egypt and married t
2 CONC o Ptolemy VIII, an uncle. It is possible that Berenice, the fiancee of Attalus III, king of Pergamum is another sister.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cleopatra Thea married three times:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p># She married Alexander Balas (Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος Βάλας) in about 150 BC. This union produced Antiochus VI Dionysus.[1][2] Alexander Balas was neither popular, nor an efficient ruler
2 CONC . The marriage was dissolved by her father.[2] Alexander Balas died in battle against Demetrius II of Syria in 145 BC.
2 CONT <p># Cleopatra Thea married Demetrius II Nicator, (Greek: Δημήτριος Νικάτωρ) in 145 BC. Cleopatra bore him two sons, who later grew up to be kings: Seleucus V Philometor, Antiochus VII
2 CONC I Grypus, and possibly a daughter Laodice. Demetrius became a captive of the Parthians from 139-129 BC. He was assassinated in Tyre in 125 BC at the orders of his wife Cleopatra Thea.
2 CONT <p># Cleopatra Thea married Demetrius' younger brother, Antiochus VII Sidetes in 137 BC after Demetrius was captured by the Parthians. Cleopatra and Antiochus VII had several children: Antiochus IX Cy

2 CONT <p>Laodice (130/129 BC-about 90 BC) was a beautiful Pontian Princess and Queen who was first wife and sister-wife to King Mithridates VI of Pontus.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>She was a monarch of Persian and Greek Macedonian ancestry. Laodice was the second daughter and among the children born to the Pontian Monarchs Laodice VI and Mithridates V of Pontus (reigned 150 B
2 CONC C-120 BC), thus she was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Her father was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held.[2] In the will of her father, Mithridates V left the Kingdom to the joint rule o
2 CONC f her mother and her brothers: Mithridates VI and Mithridates Chrestus. The brothers of Laodice were both under aged to rule and their mother retained all power as regent.[3] Laodice VI’s regency ov
2 CONC er Pontus was from 120 BC-116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC). Laodice VI favored Mithridates Chrestus over Mithridates VI. During her mother’s regency, Mithridates VI had escaped from the plotting o
2 CONC f their mother and had gone into hiding.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI between 116 BC-113 BC returned to Pontus from hiding and was hailed King. He was able to remove their mother and brother from the Pontian throne, thus Mithridates VI became the sole 
2 CONC ruler of Pontus. Mithridates VI showed clemency towards their mother and brother, by imprisoning them both.[4] Laodice VI died in prison of natural causes, however Mithridates Chrestus could have died
2 CONC  in prison from natural causes or was tried for treason and was executed on his orders.[5] When they died, Mithridates VI gave his mother and brother a royal funeral.[6]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Mithridates VI became the sole ruler of Pontus, Laodice and her brother were practicable strangers. The last time Mithridates VI saw Laodice, she was a little girl in the nursery who was spoil

2 CONC e with him as a sovereign over Pontus; to be the mother of his legitimate children to ensure their succession and to claim his right as a ruling monarch. Through marriage, Laodice became a Queen of Po
2 CONC ntus and Mithridates VI gave her the title of Queen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice bore her brother four sons: Mithridates, Arcathius, Machares, Pharnaces II of Pontus and two daughters: Cleopatra of Pontus and Drypetina (a diminutive form of "Drypetis"). Drypetina was Mi
2 CONC thridates VI’s most devoted daughter. Her baby teeth never fell out, so she had a double set of teeth[7].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At some point Laodice and Mithridates VI, set about to establish good relations with the citizens of Athens and the Greek island of Delos. Laodice and her brother-husband made benefactions to the A

2 CONC and Laodice.[8]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During one time of the absence of Mithridates VI, Laodice began to have affairs with the friends of her brother-husband. Through one of his friends, Laodice became pregnant and gave birth to her so
2 CONC n. To conceal her unfaithfulness to Mithridates VI, Laodice deceived a report of his death and on his return, plotted to have Mithridates VI’s life taken by poison.[9]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At this time Mithridates VI, returned to Pontus without warning and suddenly; and caught Laodice with her lovers. Her brother-husband and his companions were shocked and distressed to see this at S

2 CONC dren. Festive banquets were prepared to welcome him back.[10]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prior to the feast, Mithridates VI’s servants warned him of Laodice’s plots, at the feast and they also named Laodice’s co-conspirators. Feeling betrayed, he cursed his late mother for raisin
2 CONC g such a treacherous daughter, so he had Laodice and her collaborators executed immediately. Laodice’s new born son was spared by Mithridates VI and allowed him to live. After the execution of Laodi
2 CONC ce, Mithridates VI never wanted to marry a Queen by that name which spelt trouble.[11] Laodice’s fate was common knowledge and due to her treachery, Mithridates VI found it very difficult to make an

2 CONT <p>=Laodice of Cappadocia=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice of Cappadocia, also known as Laodice (Ancient Greek: Λαοδίκη Laodíkē; flourished 95 BC) was a Princess from the Kingdom of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Early life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice was a monarch of Persian and Greek Macedonian ancestry. She was the daughter; first born child of the Pontian Monarchs Laodice VI and Mithridates V Euergetes who reigned 150-120 BC. Among h
2 CONC er siblings, was King Mithridates VI Eupator Dionysius who reigned 120–63 BC. She was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Between 130-126 BC, her paternal aunt the Pontian Princess; the Queen and Regent Nysa of Cappadocia had died. Nysa was the wife and later widower of the previous Cappadocian King Ariarathes V Euseb
2 CONC es Philopator. Their son and youngest child Ariarathes VI Epiphanes Philopator, became sole ruler of Cappadocia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice’s father Mithridates V was aware of the turbulent political situation in Cappadocia, which ended in the death of his sister, Nysa. In the mids 120’s BC, Mithridates V became interested 
2 CONC in Cappadocia and wanted to expand Pontian foreign policy in the country. Mithridates V decided to invade Cappadocia as a foreign country, in order control and overrun Cappadocia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Queen consort'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ariarathes VI, in order to beat off any Pontian invasion and to defeat his opponent, arranged with Mithridates V to marry Laodice. There is a possibility that the invasion of Mithridates V was in f
2 CONC act friendly on behalf of Ariarathes VI to settle internal Cappadocian strife and help him to establish himself as a ruler. The marriage that occurred with Ariarathes VI and Laodice marked a cessation
2 CONC  of hostilities between Cappadocia and Pontus. Through this arranged marriage, Mithridates V was able to keep a close check on Ariarathes VI and thus through his daughter was able to control Cappadoci
2 CONC a indirectly and Laodice could act presumably in her father’s interests. Through marriage to her paternal cousin, Laodice became Queen of Cappadocia who wielded considerable power. Laodice bore Aria
2 CONC rathes VI one daughter and two sons: Nysa who married King Nicomedes III Euergetes of Bithynia; Ariarathes VII Philometor and Ariarathes VIII Epiphanes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates V had died in 120 BC and her first brother Mithridates VI had succeeded their father as King of Pontus. Ten years later Laodice may have found it much harder to exert control over Ariar
2 CONC athes VI. There could be a possibility that the Pontian political influence in Cappadocian affairs may have declined, as Ariarathes VI became independent minded and began to assert himself.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A Greek nobleman called Gordius of Cappadocia was a member of the court of Laodice and Ariarathes VI, who was a good friend to Mithridates VI. Laodice’s brother had continued the Pontian foreign 
2 CONC policy in Cappadocia where their father had left off. Mithridates VI had plotted with Gordius to assassinate Ariarathes VI between 116 BC-111 BC. When Mithridates VI and Gordius successful assassinate
2 CONC d Ariarathes VI, there is a possibility Laodice wasn’t involved in the murder of Ariarathes VI.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Regency'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Ariarathes VI, Laodice became a powerful widow and monarch in Cappadocia who acted as a regent for her first young son Ariarathes VII. Laodice’s former son-in-law and widower K
2 CONC ing Nicomedes III Euergetes, wanted to take advantage of the political situation in Cappadocia, so he without informing anyone suddenly invaded Cappadocia with his army as the Cappadocian throne was e
2 CONC mpty after the death of Ariarathes VI.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Nicomedes III invaded Cappadocia, Laodice decided to support him. In order to preserve Cappadocia, her sovereignty and the succession of her sons, Laodice married Nicomedes III and her life wo
2 CONC uld have better opportunities with him. Through her second marriage, she also became Queen of Bithynia. When Mithridates VI had heard about the Cappadocian invasion, he hurried with his army to help h
2 CONC is sister, but instead helped Ariarathes VII.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Later life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With the help of his maternal uncle Ariarathes VII, expelled his mother and her new husband back to Bithynia and was restored to his throne, which at this time was old enough to rule as King. At th
2 CONC is time, Mithridates VI had plans of his own; to force Gordius back into the Cappadocian court in expelling his nephews from the throne in order to rule Cappadocia for himself which in the end failed.
2 CONC  After the death of her second son in 95 BC, Laodice and Nicomedes III attempted to establish an impostor upon the Cappadocian throne as King, claiming he was her third son with Ariarathes VI. They tr
2 CONC avelled to Rome to bear witness for this person to state their claim, by their claim was rejected by the Roman Senate.

2 CONT <p>'''Ancestry, family and early life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI was a prince of Persian and Greek ancestry. He claimed descent from Cyrus the Great, the family of Darius the Great, the Regent Antipater, the generals of Alexander the Great as well
2 CONC  as the later kings Antigonus I Monophthalmus and Seleucus I Nicator.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates was born in the Pontic city of Sinope, and was raised in the Kingdom of Pontus. He was the first son among the children born to Laodice VI and Mithridates V of Pontus (reigned 150–120
2 CONC  BC). His father, Mithridates V, was a prince and the son of the former Pontic Monarchs Pharnaces I of Pontus and his wife-cousin Nysa. His mother, Laodice VI, was a Seleucid Princess and the daughter
2 CONC  of the Seleucid Monarchs Antiochus IV Epiphanes and his wife-sister Laodice IV.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates V was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope, poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held. He left the kingdom to the joint rule of Mithridates' mother, Laodice VI, Mi
2 CONC thridates, and his younger brother, Mithridates Chrestus. Neither Mithridates nor his younger brother were of age, and their mother retained all power as regent for the time being. Laodice VI’s rege
2 CONC ncy over Pontus was from 120 BC to 116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC) and favored Mithridates Chrestus over Mithridates. During his mother’s regency, he escaped from his mother's plots against him, 
2 CONC and went into hiding.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates emerged from hiding, returning to Pontus between 116 BC and 113 BC and was hailed as king. He removed his mother and brother from the throne, imprisoning both, becoming the sole ruler o
2 CONC f Pontus. Laodice VI died in prison, ostensibly of natural causes. Mithridates Chrestus may have died in prison also, or may have been tried for treason and executed. Mithridates gave both royal funer
2 CONC als. Mithridates first married his younger sister Laodice, aged 16. His goal was to preserve the purity of their bloodline, solidify his claim to the throne, to co-rule over Pontus, and to ensure the 
2 CONC succession to his legitimate children.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Early reign'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates entertained ambitions of making his state the dominant power in the Black Sea and Anatolia. He first subjugated Colchis, a region east of the Black Sea, and prior to 164 BC, an independ
2 CONC ent kingdom. He then clashed for supremacy on the Pontic steppe with the Scythian King Palacus. The most important centres of Crimea, Tauric Chersonesus and the Bosporan Kingdom readily surrendered th
2 CONC eir independence in return for Mithridates' promises to protect them against the Scythians, their ancient enemies. After several abortive attempts to invade the Crimea, the Scythians and the allied Rh
2 CONC oxolanoi suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Pontic general Diophantus and accepted Mithridates as their overlord. The young king then turned his attention to Anatolia, where Roman power was on 
2 CONC the rise. He contrived to partition Paphlagonia and Galatia with King Nicomedes III of Bithynia. It soon became clear to Mithridates that Nicomedes was steering his country into an anti-Pontic allianc
2 CONC e with the expanding Roman Republic. When Mithridates fell out with Nicomedes over control of Cappadocia, and defeated him in a series of battles, the latter was constrained to openly enlist the assis
2 CONC tance of Rome. The Romans twice interfered in the conflict on behalf of Nicomedes (95–92 BC), leaving Mithridates, should he wish to continue the expansion of his kingdom, with little choice other t
2 CONC han to engage in a future Roman-Pontic war.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Mithridatic Wars'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The next ruler of Bithynia, Nicomedes IV of Bithynia, was a figurehead manipulated by the Romans. Mithridates plotted to overthrow him, but his attempts failed and Nicomedes IV, instigated by his R
2 CONC oman advisors, declared war on Pontus. Rome itself was involved in the Social War, a civil war with its Italian allies. Thus, in all of Roman Asia Province there were only two legions present in Maced
2 CONC onia. These legions combined with Nicomedes IV's army to invade Mithridates' kingdom of Pontus in 89 BC. Mithridates, however, won a decisive victory, scattering the Roman-led forces. His victorious f
2 CONC orces were welcomed throughout Anatolia. The following year, 88 BC, Mithridates orchestrated a massacre of Roman and Italian settlers remaining in several Anatolian cities, essentially wiping out the 
2 CONC Roman presence in the region. This episode is known as the Asiatic Vespers. The Kingdom of Pontus comprised a mixed population in its Ionian Greek and Anatolian cities. The royal family moved the capi
2 CONC tal from Amasya to the Greek city of Sinope. Its rulers tried to fully assimilate the potential of their subjects by showing a Greek face to the Greek world and an Iranian/Anatolian face to the Easter
2 CONC n world. Whenever the gap between the rulers and their Anatolian subjects became greater, they would put emphasis on their Persian origins. In this manner, the royal propaganda claimed heritage both f
2 CONC rom Persian and Greek rulers, including Cyrus the Great, Darius I of Persia, Alexander the Great and Seleucus I Nicator. Mithridates too posed as the champion of Hellenism, but this was mainly to furt
2 CONC her his political ambitions; it is no proof that he felt a mission to promote its extension within his domains. Whatever his true intentions, the Greek cities (including Athens) defected to the side o
2 CONC f Mithridates and welcomed his armies in mainland Greece, while his fleet besieged the Romans at Rhodes. Neighboring King of Armenia Tigranes the Great, established an alliance with Mithridates and ma
2 CONC rried one of Mithridates’ daughters, Cleopatra of Pontus. They would support each other in the coming conflict with Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Romans responded by organising a large invasion force to defeat him and remove him from power.The First Mithridatic War, fought between 88 BC and 84 BC, saw Lucius Cornelius Sulla force Mithrid
2 CONC ates VI out of Greece proper. After victory in several battles, Sulla received news of trouble back in Rome posed by his enemy Gaius Marius and hurriedly concluded peace talks with Mithridates. As Sul
2 CONC la returned to Italy Lucius Licinius Murena was left in charge of Roman forces in Anatolia. The lenient peace treaty, which was never ratified by the Senate, allowed Mithridates VI to recoup his force
2 CONC s. Murena attacked Mithridates in 83 BC, provoking the Second Mithridatic War from 83 BC to 81 BC. Mithridates scored a victory over Murena's green forces before peace was again declared by treaty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Rome attempted to annex Bithynia (bequested to Rome by its last king) nearly a decade later, Mithridates VI attacked with an even larger army, leading to the Third Mithridatic War from 73 BC t
2 CONC o 63 BC. First Lucullus and then Pompey were sent against Mithridates VI, who surged back to retake his kingdom of Pontus, but was at last defeated by Pompey. After Pompey defeated him in Pontus in 66
2 CONC  BC, Mithridates VI fled with a small army to Colchis (modern Georgia) and then over the Caucasus Mountains to Crimea and made plans to raise yet another army to take on the Romans. His eldest living 
2 CONC son, Machares, viceroy of Cimmerian Bosporus, was unwilling to aid his father. Mithridates had Machares killed, and Mithridates took the throne of the Bosporan Kingdom. Mithridates then ordered the co
2 CONC nscriptions and preparations for war. In 63 BC, Pharnaces II of Pontus, one of his sons, led a rebellion against his father, joined by Roman exiles in the core of Mithridates' Pontic army. Mithridates
2 CONC  withdrew to the citadel in Panticapaeum, where he committed suicide. Pompey buried Mithridates in the rock-cut tombs of his ancestors in Amasya, the old capital of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Assassination conspiracy'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the time of the First Mithridatic War, a group of Mithridates' friends plotted to kill him. These were Mynnio and Philotimus of Smyrna, and Cleisthenes and Asclepiodotus of Lesbos. Asclepiod
2 CONC otus changed his mind and became an informant. He arranged to have Mithridates hide under a couch to hear the plot against him. The other conspirators were tortured and executed. However, this was not
2 CONC  enough for Mithridates, who also killed all of the plotters' families and friends.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Propaganda'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Where his ancestors pursued philhellenism as a means of attaining respectability and prestige among the Hellenistic kingdoms, Mithridates VI made use of Hellenism as a political tool. As protector 
2 CONC of Greek cities on the Black Sea and in Asia against barbarism, Mithridates VI logically became protector of Greece and Greek culture, and would use this stance in his clashes with Rome. Strabo mentio
2 CONC ns that Chersonesus buckled under the pressure of the barbarians and asked Mithridates VI to become its protector (7.4.3. c.308). The most impressive symbol of Mithridates VI's approbation with Greece
2 CONC  (Athens in particular) appears at Delos: a heroon dedicated to the Pontic king in 102/1 by the Athenian Helianax, a priest of Poseidon Aisios. A dedication at Delos, by Dicaeus, a priest of Sarapis, 
2 CONC was made in 94/93 BC on behalf of the Athenians, Romans, and "King Mithridates Eupator Dionysus." Greek styles mixed with Persian elements also abound on official Pontic coins – Perseus was favored 
2 CONC as an intermediary between both worlds, East and West. Certainly influenced by Alexander the Great, Mithridates VI extended his propaganda from "defender" of Greece to the "great liberator" of the Gre
2 CONC ek world as war with Roman Republic became inevitable. The Romans were easily translated into "barbarians", in the same sense as the Persian Empire during the war with Persia in the first half of the 
2 CONC 5th century BC and during Alexander's campaign. How many Greeks genuinely bought into this claim will never be known. It served its purpose, however. At least partially because of it, Mithridates VI w
2 CONC as able to fight the First War with Rome on Greek soil, and maintain the allegiance of Greece. His campaign for the allegiance of the Greeks was aided in no small part by his enemy Sulla, who allowed 
2 CONC his troops to sack the city of Delphi and plunder many of the city's most famous treasures to help finance his military expenses.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Death'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Pompey defeated him in Pontus, Mithridates VI fled to the lands north of the Black Sea in the winter of 66 BCE in the hope that he could raise a new army and carry on the war. However, his pr
2 CONC eparations proved to be too harsh on the local nobles and populace, and they rebelled against his rule. He allegedly attempted suicide by poison; this attempt failed, however, because of his immunity 
2 CONC to the poison. According to Appian's Roman History, he then requested his Gaulish bodyguard and friend, Bituitus, to kill him by the sword:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Mithridates then took out some poison that he always carried next to his sword, and mixed it. There two of his daughters, who were still girls growing up together, named Mithridates and Nysa, who
2 CONC  had been betrothed to the kings of [Ptolemaic] Egypt and of Cyprus, asked him to let them have some of the poison first, and insisted strenuously and prevented him from drinking it until they had tak
2 CONC en some and swallowed it. The drug took effect on them at once; but upon Mithridates, although he walked around rapidly to hasten its action, it had no effect, because he had accustomed himself to oth
2 CONC er drugs by continually trying them as a means of protection against poisoners. These are still called the Mithridatic drugs.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Seeing a certain Bituitus there, an officer of the Gauls, he said to him, "I have profited much from your right arm against my enemies. I shall profit from it most of all if you will kill me, and
2 CONC  save from the danger of being led in a Roman triumph one who has been an autocrat so many years, and the ruler of so great a kingdom, but who is now unable to die by poison because, like a fool, he h
2 CONC as fortified himself against the poison of others. Although I have kept watch and ward against all the poisons that one takes with his food, I have not provided against that domestic poison, always th
2 CONC e most dangerous to kings, the treachery of army, children, and friends." Bituitus, thus appealed to, rendered the king the service that he desired.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cassius Dio Roman History, on the other hand, records a different account:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Mithridates had tried to make away with himself, and after first removing his wives and remaining children by poison, he had swallowed all that was left; yet neither by that means nor by the swor
2 CONC d was he able to perish by his own hands. For the poison, although deadly, did not prevail over him, since he had inured his constitution to it, taking precautionary antidotes in large doses every day
2 CONC ; and the force of the sword blow was lessened on account of the weakness of his hand, caused by his age and present misfortunes, and as a result of taking the poison, whatever it was. When, therefore
2 CONC , he failed to take his life through his own efforts and seemed to linger beyond the proper time, those whom he had sent against his son fell upon him and hastened his end with their swords and spears
2 CONC . Thus Mithridates, who had experienced the most varied and remarkable fortune, had not even an ordinary end to his life. For he desired to die, albeit unwillingly, and though eager to kill himself wa
2 CONC s unable to do so; but partly by poison and partly by the sword he was at once self-slain and murdered by his foes.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the behest of Pompey, Mithridates' body was later buried alongside his ancestors (in either Sinope or Amaseia). Mount Mithridat in the central Kerch and the town of Yevpatoria in Crimea commemor
2 CONC ate his name.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Mithridates' antidote'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In his youth, after the assassination of his father Mithridates V in 120 BC, Mithridates is said to have lived in the wilderness for seven years, inuring himself to hardship. While there, and after
2 CONC  his accession, he cultivated an immunity to poisons by regularly ingesting sub-lethal doses of the same. He invented a complex "universal antidote" against poisoning; several versions are described i
2 CONC n the literature. Aulus Cornelius Celsus gives one in his De Medicina and names it Antidotum Mithridaticum, whence English mithridate. Pliny the Elder's version comprised 54 ingredients to be placed i
2 CONC n a flask and matured for at least two months. After Mithridates' death in 63 BC, many imperial Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve on the original formula, which they touted as Mithradati
2 CONC um. In keeping with most medical practices of his era, Mithridates' anti-poison routines included a religious component; they were supervised by the Agari, a group of Scythian shamans who never left h
2 CONC im. Mithridates was reportedly guarded in his sleep by a horse, a bull, and a stag, which would whinny, bellow, and bleat whenever anyone approached the royal bed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Mithridates as polyglot'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Pliny the Elder's account of famous polyglots, Mithridates could speak the languages of all the twenty-two nations he governed. This reputation led to the use of Mithridates' name as title in so
2 CONC me later works on comparative linguistics, such as Conrad Gessner's Mithridates de differentis linguis, (1555), and Adelung and Vater's Mithridates oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde (1806–1817).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Wives, mistresses and children'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI had wives and mistresses, by whom he had various children. The names he gave his children are a representation of his Persian, Greek heritage and of his ancestry.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>First wife, his sister Laodice. They were married from 115/113 BC till about 90 BC. Mithridates with Laodice had various children:
2 CONT <p>* Sons: Mithridates, Arcathius, Machares and Pharnaces II of Pontus</p>
2 CONT <p>* Daughters: Cleopatra of Pontus (sometimes called Cleopatra the Elder to distinguish her from her sister of the same name) and Drypetina (a diminutive form of "Drypetis"). Drypetina was Mithridate
2 CONC s VI’s most devoted daughter. Her baby teeth never fell out, so she had a double set of teeth.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Second wife, the Greek Macedonian Noblewoman, Monime. They were married from about 89/88 BC till 72/71 BC. By whom, he had:
2 CONT <p>* Daughter: Athenais, who married King Ariobarzanes II of Cappadocia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Third wife, Greek woman Berenice of Chios, married from 86–72/71 BC</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Fourth wife, Greek woman Stratonice of Pontus, married from after 86–63 BC
2 CONT <p>* Son: Xiphares</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Fifth wife, unknown</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sixth wife, Caucasian woman Hypsicratea, married from an unknown date to 63 BC
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>One of his mistresses was the Galatian Celtic Princess Adobogiona the Elder. By Adobogiona, Mithridates had two children: a son called Mithridates I of the Bosporus and a daughter called Adobogiona
2 CONC  the Younger.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His sons born from his concubine were Cyrus, Xerxes, Darius, Ariarathes IX of Cappadocia, Artaphernes, Oxathres, Phoenix (Mithridates’ son by a mistress of Syrian descent) and Exipodras, named af
2 CONC ter kings of the Persian Empire, which he claimed ancestry from. His daughters born from his concubine were Nysa, Eupatra, Cleopatra the Younger, Mithridates and Orsabaris. Nysa and Mithridates, were 
2 CONC engaged to the Egyptian Greek Pharaohs Ptolemy XII Auletes and his brother Ptolemy of Cyprus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 63 BC, when the Kingdom of Pontus was annexed by the Roman general Pompey the remaining sisters, wives, mistresses and children of Mithridates VI in Pontus were put to death. Plutarch writing in
2 CONC  his lives (Pompey v.45) states that Mithridates' sister and five of his children took part in Pompey's triumphal procession on this return to Rome in 61 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Cappadocian Greek nobleman and high priest of the temple-state of Comana, Cappadocia Archelaus had descended from Mithridates VI. He claimed to be a son of Mithridates VI, however chronological
2 CONC ly Archelaus may have been a maternal grandson of the Pontic King, who his father was Mithridates VI’s favorite general may have married one of the daughters of Mithridates VI.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Literature'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The poet A. E. Housman alludes to Mithridates' antidote, also known as mithridatism, in the final stanza of his poem "Terence, This Is Stupid Stuff" in A Shropshire Lad:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''There was a king reigned in the East: There, when kings will sit to feast, They get their fill before they think With poisoned meat and poisoned drink. He gathered all that springs to birth From 
2 CONC the many-venomed earth; First a little, thence to more, He sampled all her killing store; And easy, smiling, seasoned sound, Sate the king when healths went round. They put arsenic in his meat And sta
2 CONC red aghast to watch him eat; They poured strychnine in his cup And shook to see him drink it up: They shook, they stared as white’s their shirt: Them it was their poison hurt. –I tell the tale tha
2 CONC t I heard told. Mithridates, he died old.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson included his "Mithridates" in his 1847 "Poems". The legend also appears in Alexandre Dumas's novel The Count of Monte Cristo. The demise of Mithridates VI is detailed in the 167
2 CONC 3 play Mithridate written by Jean Racine. This play is the basis for several 18th century operas including one of Mozart's earliest, known most commonly by its Italian name, Mitridate, re di Ponto (17
2 CONC 70). He is the subject of the opera Mitridate Eupatore (1707) by Alessandro Scarlatti. In The Grass Crown, the second in the Masters of Rome series, Colleen McCullough, the Australian writer, describe
2 CONC s in detail the various aspects of his life – the murder of Laodice (sister-wife of Mithridates VI of Pontus), and the Roman Consul who, quite alone and surrounded by the Pontic army, ordered Mithri
2 CONC dates to leave Cappadocia immediately and go back to Pontus – which he did.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Wordsworth, amidst casting about for poetic themes in The Prelude (Bk i vv 186 ff):
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Sometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate How vanquished Mithridates northward passed, And, hidden in the cloud of years, became Odin, the Father of a race by whom Perished the Roman Empire.'
2 CONC '
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Likewise, Edna St. Vincent Millay alludes indirectly to Mithridates' protection against poison in her sonnet "Thou art not lovelier than lilacs" (from Renascence and Other Poems, 1917):
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Like him who day by day unto his draught Of delicate poison adds him one drop more Till he may drink unharmed the death of ten, Even so, inured to beauty, who have quaffed Each hour more deeply t
2 CONC han the hour before, I drink--and live--what has destroyed some men.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Dorothy L. Sayers' Detective Novel "Strong Poison", from 1929, the protagonist, Lord Peter Wimsey, refers to Mithridates' measures to survive poisoning; as well as Albert Einstein's theory of Sp
2 CONC ecial Relativity, when the protagonist warns not to trust someone who looks straight in your eye, as they're trying to distract you from seeing something, "..even the path light travels is bent".
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>James Joyce alludes to Mithridates' immunity to poison in his love poem Though I Thy Mithridates Were.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Last King is an historical novel by Michael Curtis Ford about the King and his exploits against the Roman Republic. Mithridates is a major character in Poul Anderson's novel The Golden Slave. M
2 CONC ithridates of Pontus is mentioned by E. E. "Doc" Smith in Triplanetary, the first novel of the famous Lensman science fiction series. In the story, Mithridates was supposed to be one of the humans pos
2 CONC sessed by a member of an evil alien race bent on remaking human civilization into its own image.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the novel Mithridates is Dead (Spanish: Mitrídates ha muerto), Ignasi Ribó traces parallels between the historical figures of Mithridates and Osama Bin Laden. Within a postmodern narrative of 
2 CONC the making and unmaking of history, Ribó suggests that the September 11 attacks on the United States closely paralleled the massacre of Roman citizens in 88 B.C. and prompted similar consequences, na
2 CONC mely the imperialist overstretch of the American and Roman republics respectively. Furthermore, he suggests that the ensuing Mithridatic Wars were one of the key factors in the demise of Rome's republ
2 CONC ican regime, as well as in the spread of the Christian faith in Asia Minor and eventually throughout the whole Roman Empire. The novel implies that the current events in the world might have similar u
2 CONC nforeseen consequences.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 120, while still a child, Mithridates Eupator (132-83 B.C.) becameking. His mother (said to have assassinated her husband Mithridates V)ruled in her young son's stead. Afraid his mother would tr

2 CONC d his motherimprisoned (and, possibly, executed), and set about extending hisdominion. After he acquired Greek towns in Colchis and what's now theCrimea, Mithridates established a strong fleet to hold
2 CONC  his territories.Since the Greeks provided revenue, officers, and mercenary soldiers, heset out to extend his Greek resources.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 108/07 Mithridates and Nicomedes II of Bithynia marched intoPaphlagonia. A Roman emisssary tried to force Nicomedes and Mithridatesto restore its king, Astreodon. Instead, Mithridates annexed a 
2 CONC piece ofGalatia which his father was supposed to have inherited from earlierrulers, while Nicomedes, far from restoring Paphlagonia to Astreodon, puthis son on the throne as puppet. The unsuccessful R
2 CONC oman embassy went home.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 102 Mithridates waged war on Cappadocia and installed hiseight-year-old son as king under the regency of a man named Gordius.Mithridates tried to bribe the Roman senators to accept this arrangem
2 CONC ent,his presence in Paphlagonia and Galatia, and to counter Nicomedes' claimto Cappadocia. At the same time, Nicomedes appealed to Rome on behalf ofhis own pretender. Instead of taking a clear side, R
2 CONC ome orderedMithridates to get out of Cappadocia and Nicomedes to leave Paphlagonia.Mithridates obliged and, as he claimed in 89 B.C., he also leftPaphlagonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Left to their own devices, the Cappadocian nobility selected Ariobarzanesfor their king. Sulla helped Ariobarzanes assume power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By allying himself with the neighboring kingdom through marriage,Mithridates hoped to expand his empire. The Armenians would do theinvading and reap the spoils while Pontus would gain the territory
2 CONC . Inthis way, Mithridates himself would not antagonize the Romans.
2 CONT <p>In 96/5 Tigranes I inherited the throne of Armenia and marriedMithridates' daughter Cleopatra. In 94, Nicomedes of Bithynia died. By91, Rome was embroiled in its own Social War, leaving Mithridates
2 CONC  anopportunity to expand his empire. He easily persuaded his son-in-law totake Cappadocia, offering to divide the spoils. Next, Mithridates wentafter Nicomedes' successor in Bithynia, Nicomedes III.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The ousted rulers appealed to Rome which ruled that they should berestored. M. Aquilius and Manlius Maltinus were ordered to deal with themonarchs of Pontus and Armenia
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Greedy Aquilius suggested a course of action that led to the FirstMithridatic War and his own ironic execution. Aquilius suggested thatsince the Roman proteges in Bithynia and Cappadocia were unabl
2 CONC e to paytheir debt to Rome, they should invade Mithridates' kingdom. To oblige,Nicomedes invaded Pontic territory and closed off the Bithynian Black Seaexit to Pontic ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates' response was to turn to the Romans for help, but he wasrebuffed, so he sent his son Ariarathus into Cappadocia to driveAriobazares out. Mithridates then sent an envoy to the Romancommi
2 CONC ssioners. The Romans accused the envoy of threatening war, and sobegan the first Mithridatic War -- without the ratification of the Senateand the Roman people.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates fought back. Since the Roman troops were not prepared,Mithridates saw that he could push into the Roman province of Asia. Hedid so, won, killed Aquilius (see below), and ordered the mas
2 CONC sacre of all(80,000 or, according to Plutarch, 150,000) Italians throughout the area.It is suggested that this was to insure loyalty, because all thoseinvolved in the massacre would have had much to d
2 CONC read from Romanvengeance.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates' reputation for cruelty may not have been deserved. He couldalso be merciful and generous with the people he conquered.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some cities that surrendered to Mithridates were rewarded with taxrelief. Amnesty was offered those who handed over the Roman generals.Aquilius had fled to the island of Lesbos, but its citizens wa
2 CONC ntingamnesty, handed him over. Unlike the leniency with which Mithridates hadtreated another Roman general, Oppius, whom he set free, Aquilius wasridiculed and then forced to endure an ironic death. S
2 CONC ince it was hisgreed that had set the war in motion, Mithridates had molten gold pouredinto Aquilius' mouth.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates then attempted to add Greece to his territory. He encounteredlittle resistance from Greeks tired of the tax-farming Roman equites. Bythe spring of 87, Mithridates controlled almost all 
2 CONC of Asia Minor,Greece, Thrace, part of Macedon, and dominated the Black Sea and Aegean,with the help of his general, Archelaus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Finally free from pressing business at Rome Sulla left for Greece andAsia Minor where he easily stopped Mithridates' aggression.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It was at the beginning of 87 that Sulla was able to leave Italy, onceagain, for Greece, where he began a string of successful campaigns. For awhile the Greeks remained loyal to the Pontic king, bu
2 CONC t when it becameclear the Romans might be able to restore the old order, the Greekschanged sides, preferring usurious Roman tax-collectors to an Orientaldespot.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to The Treaty of Dardanus at the conclusion of the FirstMithridatic War, Mithridates was still a friend of Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Romans captured Mithridates' headquarters in Pergamum,Mithridates was ready to make peace. Since Sulla wished to return to Rometo deal with his opponents there, the terms of the treaty (T
2 CONC reaty ofDardanus, 85/4 B.C.) were not as terrible for Mithridates as they wouldhave been otherwise. Mithridates retained Pontus, the rest of histerritories, his status as ally of Rome, but had to aban
2 CONC don his part ofPaphlagonia and Asia, restore Bithynia to Nicomedes and Cappadocia toAriobarzanes, return his prisoners, and pay 2-3000 talents as warindemnity and provide Sulla with 70-80 fully equipp

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>83-63 B.C.</p>
2 CONT <p>When Mithridates failed to live up to his agreement to leave Cappadocia,a second Mithridatic War broke out in 83. Propraetor Murena invadedPontus but was forced to withdraw. In 81, peace was declar
2 CONC ed followingthe terms of the treaty of Dardanus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the time of the rebellion of Spartacus, Rome sent in Lucius LiciniusLucullus and Aurelius Cotta to deal with Mithridates. Lucullus' troopswere in no shape to fight.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 75 or 74 Nicomedes III of Bithynia died, bestowing his kingdom uponRome. Threatened by the power of Rome in such proximity, Mithridates tookhis largest force into the neighboring kingdom, occupi
2 CONC ed Bithynia, andsent smaller forces against Asia, Cappadocia and Phrygia. In return, torepel Mithridates from Asia, the Roman senate sent Lucius LiciniusLucullus. Marcus Aurelius Cotta was sent with a
2 CONC  fleet to occupy Bithynia.When Lucullus arrived he found troops in need of discipline. Trainingthem kept him from helping Cotta, making it easy for Mithridates todefeat Cotta at Chalcedon and then bes

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Finally equipped with barely disciplined troops, Lucullus severedMithridates' land communication, while the citizens of Cyzicus held outagainst the seige long enough for Mithridates to change his m

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates tended to retreat when the Romans showed force. When Lucullusdrove into Mithridates' kingdom of Pontus, Mithridates fled to Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Once again, Mithridates decided to retreat. Lucullus did not immediatelypursue him, but instead gathered a fleet from the cities in Asia. Then,in 73, with his new fleet he almost destoyed Mithridat
2 CONC es. Lucullus wentinto Pontus to fight Mithridates at Cabira. Routed, Mithridates fled toArmenia looking for help from his son-in-law Tigranes. The Armenian kingwas not willing to provide military aid,
2 CONC  but only shelter.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes may not have been anxious to fight the Romans, but he wasn'tabout to surrender his father-in-law, Mithridates.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile, unopposed, Lucullus captured almost the entire kingdom ofPontus. He then ordered Tigranes to surrender Mithridates. When Tigranesrefused, Lucullus attacked Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lucullus' main obstacles, at this time, were his own soldiers who refusedfurther campaigns. This mutiny gave Mithridates the chance to take backsome of the territory he had lost. Realizing they nee

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When properly equipped with disciplined troops and a competent general,there was no contest between Rome and Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pompey began invading Pontus in 66 B.C. Mithridates tried unsuccessfullyto enlist the support of Tigranes, but his brother-in-law had troubles ofhis own. Tigranes's son, backed by Rome, was seeking

2 CONT <p>It is said that when Mithridates saw that the people of the Crimeasupported his son over him, Mithridates endeavored to take his own life,but failed because of the resistance he'd built up to poiso

2 CONT <p>Life.</p>
2 CONT <p>Mithradates the Great was the sixth--and last--Pontic ruler by that name. Mithradates (often misspelled Mithridates and meaning "gift of [the god] Mithra") was a common name among Anatolian rulers 
2 CONC of the age. When Mithradates VI succeeded his father, Mithradates Euergetes, in 120 BC, he was then only 11 years of age, and for a few years his mother ruled in his place. About 115 BC, she was depos
2 CONC ed and thrown into prison by her son, who thereafter ruled alone. Mithradates began his long career of conquest by dispatching successful expeditions to the Crimea and to Colchis (on the eastern shore
2 CONC  of the Black Sea). Both districts were added to the Pontic kingdom. To the Greeks of the Tauric Chersonese and the Cimmerian Bosporus (Crimea and Straits of Kerch), Mithradates was a deliverer from t
2 CONC heir Scythian enemies, and they gladly surrendered their independence in return for the protection given to them by his armies. In Anatolia, however, the royal dominions had been considerably diminish
2 CONC ed after the death of Mithradates V: Paphlagonia had freed itself, and Phrygia (c. 116 BC) had been linked to the Roman province of Asia. Mithradates' first move there was to partition Paphlagonia and
2 CONC  Galatia between himself and Nicomedes III of Bithynia, but next he quarreled with Nicomedes over Cappadocia. Successful at first on two occasions, he was on both deprived of his advantage by Roman in
2 CONC tervention (c. 95 and 92). While appearing to acquiesce, he resolved to expel the Romans from Asia. A first attempt to depose Nicomedes IV of Bithynia, who was completely subservient to the Romans, wa
2 CONC s frustrated (c. 90). Then Nicomedes, instigated by Rome, attacked Pontic territory, and Mithradates, after protesting in vain to the Romans, finallydeclared war (88).
2 CONT <p>Nicomedes and the Roman armies were defeated and flung back to the coasts of the Propontis and the Aegean. The Roman province of Asia was occupied, and most of the Greek cities in western Asia Mino
2 CONC r allied themselves with Mithradates, though a few held out against him, such as Rhodes, which he besieged unsuccessfully. He also sent large armies into Greece, where Athens and other cities took his
2 CONC  side. But the Roman generals, Sulla in Greece and Fimbria in Asia, defeated his forces in several battles during 86 and 85. In 88 he had arranged a general massacre of the Roman and Italian residents
2 CONC  in Asia (80,000 are said to have perished), in order that the Greek cities, as his accessories in the crime, should feel irrevocably committed to the struggle against Rome. As the war turned against 
2 CONC him, his former leniency toward the Greeks changed to severity; every kind of intimidation was resorted to--deportations, murders, freeing of slaves. But this reign of terror couldnot prevent the citi
2 CONC es from deserting to the victorious side. In 85, when the war was clearly lost, he made peace with Sulla in the Treaty of Dardanus, abandoning his conquests, surrendering his fleet, and paying a large
2 CONC  fine.
2 CONT <p>In what is called the Second Mithradatic War, the Roman general Lucius Licinius Murena invaded Pontus without provocation in 83 but was defeated in 82. Hostilities were suspended, but disputes cons
2 CONC tantly occurred, and in 74 a general war broke out. Mithradates defeated Marius Aurelius Cotta, the Roman consul, at Chalcedon, but Lucullus worsted him outside Cyzicus (73) and drove him, in 72, to t
2 CONC ake refuge in Armenia with his son-in-law Tigranes. After scoring two great victories at Tigranocerta (69) and Artaxata (68), Lucullus was disconcerted by the defeat of his lieutenants and by mutiny a
2 CONC mong his troops. In 66 Lucullus was superseded by Pompey, who completely defeated both Mithradates and Tigranes.
2 CONT <p>Mithradates then established himself in 64 at Panticapaeum (Kerch) onthe Cimmerian Bosporus and was planning an invasion of Italy by way of the Danube when his own troops, led by his son Pharnaces 
2 CONC II, revolted against him. After failing in an attempt to poison himself, Mithradates ordered a Gallic mercenary to kill him. His body was sent to Pompey, who buried it in the royal sepulchre at Sinope
2 CONC , the Pontic capital.
2 CONT <p>Assessment.</p>
2 CONT <p>Mithradates was a man of great stature and physical strength, a bravefighter, and a keen hunter. He also had some of the worst traits often associated with the Oriental despot--cruelty and sensuali
2 CONC ty, in particular. But it cannot be denied that Mithradates was a ruler of astonishing energy and determination, or that he possessed political skill of a high order. That he was one of the few men to
2 CONC  offer a serious challenge to the Roman Republic is sufficient testimony to his ability. He organized the forces at his disposal very effectively, and he had agood grasp of strategy. He was unlucky in
2 CONC  having to face three exceptionally brilliant Roman generals; unlucky, too, in coming to power ata time when the Hellenistic world was in the final stage of its collapse. It is quite conceivable that 
2 CONC had he been born a century earlier he could have constructed an enduring Greco-Asiatic empire. A cunning,brutal tyrant, he concerned himself solely with maintaining and strengthening his own power. He
2 CONC  posed as the champion of Hellenism, but this was mainly to further his political ambitions; it is no proof that he was deeply imbued with Greek culture or that he felt a mission to promote its extens
2 CONC ion within his domains. Hellenism made advances in Pontus during his reign, as it had under his predecessors, but this wasa natural process. He treated all alike; Greek, Roman, and Asiatic were welcom
2 CONC e at his court provided that they could be of use to him (hismilitary subordinates were mostly Greeks, though in later years he employed several Roman renegades), but he trusted no one. Just as it is 
2 CONC impossible to speak of his favouring one religion or culture above another, so it is impossible to believe that he had any notion of bringing Greeks and Asiatics closer together in a new kind of polit
2 CONC ical and social system. His posing as a liberator of the Greeks from Roman oppression and, later, his encouragement of social revolution in the Greekcities of the province of Asia can only be interpre
2 CONC ted, in both cases, as the actions of an opportunist seeking immediate political advantages. [Encyclopædia Britannica CD '97, MITHRADATES VI EUPATOR]
2 CONT <p>----------</p>
2 CONT <p>Mithradates (Mithridates) VI Eupator of Pontus (c. 132-63 BC) was still a minor in 120--the year that his father was murdered--when he was named joint ruler with his mother and brother. For some ye
2 CONC ars he was arefugee from his mother's power. Then, in a sudden sally, he secured the throne, imprisoned his mother, killed his brother, and married hissister. Pontus, sprawling along the southern coas
2 CONC t of the Black Sea, included Greek colonies and a native population; the largest section of the people, including the rulers, were Iranian. Mithradates was able, cunning, and ambitious. He secured mon
2 CONC ey and men by expanding to the north and then turned to Anatolia, the Aegean islands, and even Greece, where the financial oppression of the Romans made him appear a liberator. The Romans defeated him
2 CONC  time and again, but he showed a subtle resilience until his final defeat by Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (106-48BC). In 67 Pompey made his greatest contribution to peaceful trade and development by his sys

2 CONT <p>History</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI was the son of Mithridates V of Pontus (150 BC – 120 BC), called Euergetes. Mithridates VI spent much of his early career as a fugitive. To clear his path to the throne of the king
2 CONC dom of Pontus, he killed off many of his brothers but not his sister, Laodice, whom he married. He was ambitious and sought to invade a number of neighbours, including Bithynia, which brought him into
2 CONC  conflict with the expanding Roman Republic during its later years.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After conquering western Anatolia in 88 BC, Mithridates VI ordered the killing of all Romans living there. The massacre of 80,000 Roman men, women and children brought matters to a head. During the
2 CONC  First Mithridatic War fought between 88 BC and 84 BC, Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates VI out of Greece proper but then had to return to Italy to answer the threat posed by Marius; subsequen
2 CONC tly, Mithridates VI was defeated but not beaten. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved a mere temporary setback. Mithridates VI recouped his forces, and when Rome attempted to anne
2 CONC x Bithynia, Mithridates VI attacked with an even larger army, leading to the Second Mithridatic War from 83 BC to 81 BC. First Lucullus and then Pompey the Great were sent against Mithridates VI, who 
2 CONC was at last defeated by Pompey in the Third Mithridatic War of 75 BC to 65 BC. After his final defeat in 65 BC, Mithridates VI fled and attempted to raise yet another army to take on the Romans but fa
2 CONC iled to do so. In 63, he fled to the citadel in Panticapaeum. Later he marched north with a small amount of men. At Colchis he commandeered a fleet and went to his eldest son, Manchares's kingdom of B
2 CONC osporus. However, when he arrived he found his son had betrayed him. Manchares committed suicide and Mithridates Eupator VI took the throne of Bosporus. Mithridates ordered the conscription of many Sc
2 CONC ythians in order to regain his kingdom. Pharnaces II, his younger son led a Scythian rebellion against his father. This rebellion was caused by Roman exiles that Mithridates kept as the core of his Po
2 CONC ntic army. Mithridates attempted suicide but was unsuccessful because of his immunity to poison. He later asked his cheif bodygaurd, Bitiutus to kill him. Thus the last king of Pontus disappeared off 
2 CONC the face of the earth. [1][2]

2 CONT <p>Culture</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Two curious legends are told of Mithridates VI of Pontus. First, he was supposed to have had a prodigious memory. Pliny the Elder and other historians report that Mithridates could speak the langua
2 CONC ges of all the twenty-two nations he governed. [1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From this legend, several books that published samples of many languages were entitled Mithridates.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The second legend is that Mithridates VI sought to harden himself against poisoning by taking increasing sub-lethal doses of the poisons he knew of until he was able to tolerate lethal doses. A. E.
2 CONC  Housman alludes to this practice, also known as mithridatism, in the poem Terence, this is stupid stuff in A Shropshire Lad. The legend also appears in the novel, The Count of Monte Cristo. Out of fe
2 CONC ar of being poisoned by one of his many enemies, Mithridates VI fashioned a universal antidote, Antidotum Mithridaticum, consisting of several ingredients. Among the ingredients were opium and honey; 
2 CONC the antidote was put in a closed flask in which it was to stay for at least two months. Every day Mithridates VI took this medicine to counteract possible attempts to poison him. When Mithridates VI w
2 CONC as at last defeated by Pompey and in danger of capture by Rome, he is alleged to have attempted suicide by poison; this attempt failed, however, because of the immunity from the antidote. He made one 
2 CONC of his servants kill him by the sword. Antidotum Mithridaticum was used for about 1900 years after this and is called Theriac. The most famous sort is called Theriacum Andromachi after the physician o
2 CONC f Nero.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The demise of Mithridates VI is detailed in the 1673 play Mithridates made by Jean Racine. This play is the basis for many 18th century operas including one of Mozart's earliest, known most commonl
2 CONC y by its Italian name, Mitridate, re di Ponto (1770). The Last King is a historical novel by Michael Curtis Ford about the King and his exploits against the Roman Republic.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In The Grass Crown the second in the Masters of Rome series, Colleen McCullough, the Australian writer, describes in detail the various aspects - the murder of his sister/wife Laodice, his experime
2 CONC nts with poison, and his fear and hatred of Rome - of his life. The aging Gaius Marius meets Mithridates in the palace of Ariarathus in Eusebeia Mazaca, a city in Cappadocia, and the former Roman Cons
2 CONC ul, quite alone and surrounded by the Pontic army, orders Mithridates to leave Cappadocia immediately and go back to Pontus - which he does.

2 CONT <p>Mithradates VI EUPATOR, byname MITHRADATES THE GREAT (d. 63 BC, Panticapaeum [now in Ukraine]), king of Pontus in northern Anatolia (120-63BC). Under his energetic leadership, Pontus expanded to ab
2 CONC sorb several of its small neighbours and, briefly, contested Rome's hegemony in Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p>Life.</p>
2 CONT <p>Mithradates the Great was the sixth--and last--Pontic ruler by that name. Mithradates (often misspelled Mithridates and meaning "gift of [the god] Mithra") was a common name among Anatolian rulers 
2 CONC of the age. When Mithradates VI succeeded his father, Mithradates Euergetes, in 120 BC, he was then only 11 years of age, and for a few years his mother ruled in his place. About 115 BC, she was depos
2 CONC ed and thrown into prison by her son, who thereafter ruled alone. Mithradates began his long career of conquest by dispatching successful expeditions to the Crimea and to Colchis (on the eastern shore
2 CONC  of the Black Sea). Both districts were added to the Pontic kingdom. To the Greeks of the Tauric Chersonese and the Cimmerian Bosporus (Crimea and Straits of Kerch), Mithradates was a deliverer from t
2 CONC heir Scythian enemies, and they gladly surrendered their independence in return for the protection given to them by his armies. In Anatolia, however, the royal dominions had been considerably diminish
2 CONC ed after the death of Mithradates V: Paphlagonia had freed itself, and Phrygia (c. 116 BC) had been linked to the Roman province of Asia. Mithradates' first move there was to partition Paphlagonia and
2 CONC  Galatia between himself and Nicomedes III of Bithynia, but next he quarreled with Nicomedes over Cappadocia. Successful at first on two occasions, he was on both deprived of his advantage by Roman in
2 CONC tervention (c. 95 and 92). While appearing to acquiesce, he resolved to expel the Romans from Asia. A first attempt to depose Nicomedes IV of Bithynia, who was completely subservient to the Romans, wa
2 CONC s frustrated (c. 90). Then Nicomedes, instigated by Rome, attacked Pontic territory, and Mithradates, after protesting in vain to the Romans, finallydeclared war (88).
2 CONT <p>Nicomedes and the Roman armies were defeated and flung back to the coasts of the Propontis and the Aegean. The Roman province of Asia was occupied, and most of the Greek cities in western Asia Mino
2 CONC r allied themselves with Mithradates, though a few held out against him, such as Rhodes, which he besieged unsuccessfully. He also sent large armies into Greece, where Athens and other cities took his
2 CONC  side. But the Roman generals, Sulla in Greece and Fimbria in Asia, defeated his forces in several battles during 86 and 85. In 88 he had arranged a general massacre of the Roman and Italian residents
2 CONC  in Asia (80,000 are said to have perished), in order that the Greek cities, as his accessories in the crime, should feel irrevocably committed to the struggle against Rome. As the war turned against 
2 CONC him, his former leniency toward the Greeks changed to severity; every kind of intimidation was resorted to--deportations, murders, freeing of slaves. But this reign of terror couldnot prevent the citi
2 CONC es from deserting to the victorious side. In 85, when the war was clearly lost, he made peace with Sulla in the Treaty of Dardanus, abandoning his conquests, surrendering his fleet, and paying a large
2 CONC  fine.
2 CONT <p>In what is called the Second Mithradatic War, the Roman general Lucius Licinius Murena invaded Pontus without provocation in 83 but was defeated in 82. Hostilities were suspended, but disputes cons
2 CONC tantly occurred, and in 74 a general war broke out. Mithradates defeated Marius Aurelius Cotta, the Roman consul, at Chalcedon, but Lucullus worsted him outside Cyzicus (73) and drove him, in 72, to t
2 CONC ake refuge in Armenia with his son-in-law Tigranes. After scoring two great victories at Tigranocerta (69) and Artaxata (68), Lucullus was disconcerted by the defeat of his lieutenants and by mutiny a
2 CONC mong his troops. In 66 Lucullus was superseded by Pompey, who completely defeated both Mithradates and Tigranes.
2 CONT <p>Mithradates then established himself in 64 at Panticapaeum (Kerch) onthe Cimmerian Bosporus and was planning an invasion of Italy by way of the Danube when his own troops, led by his son Pharnaces 
2 CONC II, revolted against him. After failing in an attempt to poison himself, Mithradates ordered a Gallic mercenary to kill him. His body was sent to Pompey, who buried it in the royal sepulchre at Sinope
2 CONC , the Pontic capital.
2 CONT <p>Assessment.</p>
2 CONT <p>Mithradates was a man of great stature and physical strength, a bravefighter, and a keen hunter. He also had some of the worst traits often associated with the Oriental despot--cruelty and sensuali
2 CONC ty, in particular. But it cannot be denied that Mithradates was a ruler of astonishing energy and determination, or that he possessed political skill of a high order. That he was one of the few men to
2 CONC  offer a serious challenge to the Roman Republic is sufficient testimony to his ability. He organized the forces at his disposal very effectively, and he had agood grasp of strategy. He was unlucky in
2 CONC  having to face three exceptionally brilliant Roman generals; unlucky, too, in coming to power ata time when the Hellenistic world was in the final stage of its collapse. It is quite conceivable that 
2 CONC had he been born a century earlier he could have constructed an enduring Greco-Asiatic empire. A cunning,brutal tyrant, he concerned himself solely with maintaining and strengthening his own power. He
2 CONC  posed as the champion of Hellenism, but this was mainly to further his political ambitions; it is no proof that he was deeply imbued with Greek culture or that he felt a mission to promote its extens
2 CONC ion within his domains. Hellenism made advances in Pontus during his reign, as it had under his predecessors, but this wasa natural process. He treated all alike; Greek, Roman, and Asiatic were welcom
2 CONC e at his court provided that they could be of use to him (hismilitary subordinates were mostly Greeks, though in later years he employed several Roman renegades), but he trusted no one. Just as it is 
2 CONC impossible to speak of his favouring one religion or culture above another, so it is impossible to believe that he had any notion of bringing Greeks and Asiatics closer together in a new kind of polit
2 CONC ical and social system. His posing as a liberator of the Greeks from Roman oppression and, later, his encouragement of social revolution in the Greekcities of the province of Asia can only be interpre
2 CONC ted, in both cases, as the actions of an opportunist seeking immediate political advantages. [Encyclopædia Britannica CD '97, MITHRADATES VI EUPATOR]

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The earliest Tigranes is mentioned in the Cyropaedia and in Armenian historical sources. He was a king of Armenia (or at least of a proto-Armenian state) and an ally of Cyrus the Great. One of his 
2 CONC sons was also named Tigranes. This son is usually assumed to have succeeded his father, but nothing is known about him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By far the best-known Tigranes is Tigranes the Great, king of Armenia from 95 to 55 B.C., who founded a short-lived Armenian empire. His father, who ruled from 115 to 95 B.C., was also named Tigran
2 CONC es, as were several later kings of Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There is some lack of consistency in assigning dynastic numbers to these kings. The earliest Tigranes and his son are usually not included, making Tigranes I the father of Tigranes the Great. Howev
2 CONC er, Tigranes the Great is also sometimes known as Tigranes I, in his capacity as a successor to the Seleucid dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Another Tigranes was a member of the Achaemenid family who, according to Herodotus, commanded the Medes in the army of Xerxes during the invasion of Greece.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes is the Hellenized form of the name, found in classical sources. Tigran and Dikran are closer to local Armenian usage.

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy VI Philometor (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Φιλομήτωρ, Ptolemaĩos Philomḗtōr, ca. 186–145 BC) was a king of Egypt from the Ptolemaic period. He reigned from 180 to 145 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy succeeded in 180 BC at the age of about 6 and ruled jointly with his mother, Cleopatra I, until her death in 176 BC. The following year he married his sister, Cleopatra II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 170 BC, Antiochus IV began the sixth Syrian War and invaded Egypt twice. He was crowned as its king in 168 BC, but abandoned his claim on the orders of the Roman Senate.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From 169–164 BC, Egypt was ruled by a triumvirate consisting of Ptolemy, his sister-queen and his younger brother known as Ptolemy VIII Physcon. In 164 BC he was driven out by his brother and wen
2 CONC t to Rome to seek support, which he received from Cato. He was restored the following year by the intervention of the Alexandrians and ruled uneasily, cruelly suppressing frequent rebellions.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 152 BC, he briefly ruled jointly with one of his sons, known as Ptolemy Eupator, but it is thought that Ptolemy Eupator died that same year.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy VI Philometor (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Φιλομήτωρ, Ptolemaĩos Philomḗtōr, ca. 186–145 BC) was a king of Egypt from the Ptolemaic period. He reigned from 180 to 145 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy succeeded in 180 BC at the age of about 6 and ruled jointly with his mother, Cleopatra I, until her death in 176 BC, which is what 'Philometor', his epithet, implies; "he who loves his moth
2 CONC er", φίλος (beloved,friend) + μήτηρ (mother). The following year he married his sister, Cleopatra II, as it was customary for Pharaohs, for the Ptolemaic Greek kings had adopted many customs
2 CONC  of the Pharaohs. He had at least four children with her: Ptolemy Eupator, Ptolemy Neos, Cleopatra Thea and Cleopatra III, and possibly Berenice.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 170 BC, the Seleucid king Antiochus IV began the sixth Syrian War and invaded Egypt twice.[citation needed] He was crowned as its king in 168. According to Livy’s The History of Rome from its 
2 CONC Foundation (XLV.12), he abandoned his claim on the orders of the Roman Senate.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From 169–164, Egypt was ruled by a triumvirate consisting of Ptolemy, his sister-queen and his younger brother known as Ptolemy VIII Physcon.[citation needed] In 164 he was driven out by his brot
2 CONC her and went to Rome to seek support, which he received from Cato.[citation needed] He was restored the following year by the intervention of the Alexandrians and ruled uneasily, cruelly suppressing f
2 CONC requent rebellions.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 152 BC, he briefly ruled jointly with one of his sons, known as Ptolemy Eupator, but it is thought that Ptolemy Eupator died that same year.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Around 150 BC he recognised Alexander Balas as the Seleucid king by marrying his daughter Cleopatra Thea to him in a ceremony at Ptolemais Akko. In 145 BC, however, while Alexander was putting down
2 CONC  a rebellion in Cilicia, Ptolemy VI invaded Syria, securing safe passage through Judaea from Alexander's vassal Jonathan Maccabee, and capturing the city of Seleucia. He remarried his daughter to Alex
2 CONC ander's rival Demetrius II, and went to Antioch, where he crowned himself King of Asia. Alexander was defeated by Ptolemy when he returned from Cilicia with his army and fled to Arabia, where he was k
2 CONC illed. For the first time since the death of Alexander the Great, Egypt and Syria were united. However, Ptolemy died three days later, in unknown circumstances.

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy VI (186?-145 bc), called Ptolemy Philometor ("loving his mother"),
2 CONT <p>king of Egypt (181-145 bc), the son of Ptolemy V and Cleopatra I. During
2 CONT <p>his reign, Egypt was invaded by the Seleucid king Antiochus IV, and</p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy was made a prisoner. The throne was then given by the Alexandrians
2 CONT <p>to his brother, Ptolemy VII. After Antiochus withdrew, the brothers ruled
2 CONT <p>as joint kings. Conflicts between them arose, and through Roman</p>
2 CONT <p>arbitration, Cyrenaica was given to Ptolemy VII to rule. After the death
2 CONT <p>of the Seleucid king Demetrius I in 150 bc, Ptolemy VI was offered the</p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucid crown by the people of Antioch, but he declined in favor of the
2 CONT <p>legitimate heir, Demetrius II. In 145 bc Ptolemy VI died of wounds</p>
2 CONT <p>received in a battle, which resulted in the final defeat of Demetrius II's

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy VI Philometor (Greek: ?t??eµa??? F???µ?t??, c. 191-145 BC) was a king of Egypt from the Ptolemaic period. He reigned from 180 to 145 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy succeeded in 180 at the age of about 12 and ruled jointly with his mother, Cleopatra I, until her death in 176 BC. The following year he married his sister, Cleopatra II.

2 CONT <p>He is reputed to have taken as eromenos a boy named Galestes, whom he loved not only for his good looks but also for his wisdom. (Aelian, Varia Historia, I.30) Ptolemy VI Philometer was killed in S

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy Philometor reigned for a short time with his son, Ptolemy Eupator. Eupator is only attested on monumental inscriptions, and when he was first discovered, there was a theory that he was an e

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy V Epiphanes (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Ἐπιφανής, Ptolemaĩos Epiphanḗs, reigned 204–181 BCE), son of Ptolemy IV Philopator and Arsinoe III of Egypt, was the 5th ruler of the

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy Epiphanes was only a small boy when his father, Ptolemy Philopator, died. The two leading favorites of Philopator, Agathocles and Sosibius, fearing that Arsinoe would secure the regency had
2 CONC  her murdered before she heard of her husband's death, which secured the regency for themselves. In 202 BCE however Tlepolemus, the general in charge of Pelusium, put himself at the head of a revolt. 
2 CONC Once Epiphanes was in the hands of Tlepolemus he was persuaded to give a sign that the killers of his mother should be killed. According to Bevan the child king's consent was given more from fear than
2 CONC  anything else and Agathocles along with several of his supporters being killed by the Alexandrian mob.[2]

2 CONT <p>Antiochus III the Great and Philip V of Macedon made a pact to divide the Ptolemaic possessions overseas. Philip seized several islands and places in Caria and Thrace, whilst the Battle of Panium (
2 CONC 198 BCE) definitely transferred Coele-Syria, including Judea, from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus after this concluded peace, giving his own daughter Cleopatra I to Epiphanes to marry (193–192 BCE). Nevertheless, when war broke out between Antiochus and Rome, Egypt ranged itself wit

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Great cruelty and treachery were displayed in the suppression of the native rebellion, and some accounts represent him as personally tyrannical. In 197 BCE Lycopolis was held by the forces of Ankma

2 CONT <p>''The Egyptian Revolt''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Great cruelty and treachery were displayed in the suppression of the native rebellion, and some accounts represent Epiphanes as personally tyrannical. In 197 BC, Lycopolis was held by the forces of
2 CONC  Ankmachis (also known as Chaonnophris), the secessionist pharaoh of Upper Egypt, but he was forced to withdraw to Thebes. The war between North and South continued until 185 BC with the arrest of Ank
2 CONC machis by Ptolemaic General Conanus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 183 BC/184 BC, the rebels in Lower Egypt surrendered on the basis of terms that Epiphanes had personally promised to honor. However, showing himself treacherous and vindictive, he had them put t
2 CONC o death in a cruel manner.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Memphis Decree, published in three languages on the Rosetta Stone and other stelae, announced the rule and ascension to godhood of Ptolemy V, and contained concessions to the priesthood, and ha

2 CONT <p>'''Succession'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The elder of Ptolemy V's two sons, Ptolemy VI Philometor (181–145 BC), succeeded as an infant under the regency of his mother Cleopatra the Syrian. Her death was followed by a rupture between the
2 CONC  Ptolemaic and Seleucid courts, on the old question of Coele-Syria.

2 CONT <p>'''Legacy'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy V's reign was also marked by trade with other contemporaneous polities. In the 1930s, excavations by Mattingly at a fortress close to Port Dunford (the likely Nikon of antiquity) in present
2 CONC -day southern Somalia yielded a number of Ptolemaic coins. Among these pieces were 17 copper mints from the Ptolemy III to Ptolemy V dynasties, as well as late Imperial Rome and Mamluk Sultanate coins

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy V Epiphanes ( Greek: ?t??eµa??? ?p?fa???, reigned 204-181 BCE), son of Ptolemy IV Philopator and Arsinoe III of Egypt, was not more than five years old when he came to the throne, and unde

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy Epiphanes was only a small boy when his father, Ptolemy Philopator, died. The two leading favorites of Philopator, Agathocles and Sosibius, fearing that Arsinoe would secure the regency had
2 CONC  her murdered before she heard of her husband's death so securing the regency for themselves. In 202 BCE however Tlepolemus, the general in charge of Pelusium put himself at the head of a revolt which
2 CONC  ended with Agathocles and several of his supporters being killed by the Alexandrian mob.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III the Great and Philip V of Macedon made a pact to divide the Ptolemaic possessions overseas. Philip seized several islands and places in Caria and Thrace, whilst the Battle of Panium (
2 CONC 198 BCE) definitely transferred Coele-Syria, including Judea, from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus after this concluded peace, giving his own daughter Cleopatra I to Epiphanes to wife (193 -192 BCE). Nevertheless, when war broke out between Antiochus and Rome, Egypt ranged itself with 
2 CONC the latter power. Epiphanes in manhood was remarkable as a passionate sportsman; he excelled in athletic exercises and the chase.

2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 197 BC Antiochus III had captured a number of cities in Asia Minor previously under the control of the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt. The Romans supported the Egyptian interests, when they negotiat
2 CONC ed with the Seleucid king in Lysimachia in 196 BC. In response, Antiochus III indicated his willingness to make peace with Ptolemy V and to have his daughter Cleopatra I marry Ptolemy V. They were bet
2 CONC rothed in 195 BC and their marriage took place in 193 BC in Raphia. At that time Ptolemy V was about 16 years and Cleopatra I about 10 years old. Later on, Egypt's Ptolemaic kings were to argue that C
2 CONC leopatra I had received Coele-Syria as her dowry and, therefore, this territory again belonged to Egypt. It is not clear if this was the case. However, in practice, Coele-Syria remained a Seleucid pos
2 CONC session after the Battle of Panium in 198 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Alexandria, Cleopatra I was called the Syrian. As part of the Ptolemaic cult she was honoured with her husband as Theoi Epiphaneis. In line with ancient Egyptian tradition, she was also named ad
2 CONC elphe (= sister) of Ptolemy V. A synod of priests held at Memphis in 185 BC transferred all honours that Ptolemy V had received in 196 BC (written on the Rosetta stone) to his wife.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 187 BC, Cleopatra I was appointed vizier and upon her husband's death in 180 BC, she ruled on behalf of her young son, Ptolemy VI. She was the first Ptolemaic queen to be a sole ruler of Egypt. 
2 CONC This can be concluded from date formulas on the papyri written in the years from 179 BC to 176 BC, where Cleopatra I is called Thea Epiphanes and her name is written before that of her son. She also m
2 CONC inted her own coins, which also bear her name before that of her son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On June 22, 2010, archaeologists uncovered a gold coin bearing her image at Tel Kedesh in Israel near the Lebanon border. It was reported to be the heaviest and most valuable gold coin ever found i
2 CONC n Israel.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Just before his death, Ptolemy V had planned to conduct a war against the Seleucid kingdom but when Cleopatra I became sole ruler, she immediately ended the war preparations directed against her br
2 CONC other Seleucus IV Philopator. Cleopatra I died around 176 BC.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>*Demetrius I (Greek: Δημήτριος Α, c. 187 BC - 150 BC), surnamed Soter (Greek: Σωτήρ - "Savior"), was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire.
2 CONT <p>*He had been sent to Rome as a hostage during the reign of his father, '''Seleucus IV Philopator'''. After his father's death in 175 BC, Antiochus IV Epiphanes took advantage of Demetrius' captivit
2 CONC y to seize the throne. Demetrius escaped from confinement and established himself on the Syrian throne (162 BC) after overthrowing and murdering King Antiochus V Eupator, his cousin.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>*Demetrius acquired his surname of Soter, or Saviour, from the Babylonians, whom he delivered from the tyranny of the Median satrap, Timarchus. Timarchus, who had distinguished himself by defending
2 CONC  Media against the emergent Parthians, seems to have treated Demetrius' accession as an excuse to declare himself an independent king and extend his realm into Babylonia. His forces were however not e

2 CONT <p>*Demetrius is famous in Jewish history for his victory over the Maccabees.

2 CONT <p>*Demetrius' downfall is attributed to Heracleides, a surviving brother of the defeated rebel Timarchus, who championed the cause of Alexander Balas, a boy he claimed was a natural son of Antiochus

2 CONT <p>Gissel i Roma [rediger]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrios ble sendt til Roma som gissel i løpet av styret til sin far Selevkos IV Filopator og sin mor Laodike IV.[1] Da hans far ble myrdet av sin finansminister Heliodoros i 175 f.Kr.,[2] drepte
2 CONC  hans onkel Antiokos IV Epifanes tronraneren, tok selv tronen. Da onkelen døde i 163 f.Kr.,[3] ble hans 9 år gamle sønn Antiokos V Eupator gjort til konge ved hærføreren og kansleren Lysias. Deme
2 CONC trios var da 22 år gammel (hvilket innebærer at han ble født i 185 f.Kr.). Han ba det romerske senatet om gi tilbake tronen til ham, men de avslo da de mente at det var bedre at Syria ble styrt av 
2 CONC en gutt og hans regent enn av en mann, i henhold til historikeren Appian.[4] To år senere ble styret til Antiokos V Eupator i stor grad svekket da Roma sendte en ambassadør som i henhold til at Sele
2 CONC vkideriket hadde forbrudt seg mot vilkårene i freden i Apamea ved å ha for mye våpen. Den romerske sendebudet reiste rundt i Syria og senket krigsskip og lemlestet krigselefanter, men denne regente
2 CONC ns underdanighet som tillott romerne å gjøre dette, opprørte folket så mye at de drepte utsendingen Gnaeus Octavius i 162 f.Kr. I denne kritiske tiden greide Demetrios å flykte fra Roma og da han
2 CONC  ankom Syria ble han jublende ønsket velkommen. Han kunne uten vanskeligheter ta tronen og fikk øyeblikkelig henrettet Antiokos V Eupator og hans regent Lysias.[5]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Krigføring [rediger]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrios er kjent jødisk historie for hans seier over makkabeerne i Judea, og drepte helten Judas Makkabeus i 160 f.Kr.[6]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrios fikk sitt tilnavn Soter (gresk S?t??, «frelser») fra babylonerne som han frigjorde fra tyranniet til Timarkos, medernes satrap (guvernør). Timarkos, som hadde utmerket seg selv ved å 
2 CONC forsvare Media mot invaderende partiere, synes å behandlet Demetrios' tiltredelse som konge som et påskudd for å erklære seg selv som en uavhengig konge og utvidet sitt rike inn i Babylonia. Hans 
2 CONC militære styrker var imidlertid ikke store nok til å stå imot Selevkiderikets konge. Demetrios beseiret og drepte Timarkos i 160 f.Kr., og deretter dro han nordover og avsatte Ariarathes V, konge a
2 CONC v Kappadokia i Anatolia. Med dette var Selevkideriket for øyeblikket forent igjen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det er mulig at Demetrios giftet seg med sin søster Laodike V som han fikk tre sønner med, Demetrios II Nikator, Antiokos VII Sidetes og Antigonos.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Undergang [rediger]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrios' undergang kan bli tilskrevet til Herakleides, en overlevende bror av den beseirende opprøren Timarkos som kjempet for saken til Aleksander I Balas, en gutt som hevdet å være en ektef�
2 CONC �dt sønn av Antiokos IV Epifanes og således en rettmessig arving av Selevkiderikets trone. Herakleides greide å overbevise det romerske senatet om støtte for den unge utfordreren mot Demetrios.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Jødene hadde også en rolle i Demetrios' undergang. Aleksander I Balas kom med en hær av leiesoldater, gikk i land og okkuperte havnebyen Ptolemais (dagens Akko) og styrte her som en rivaliserend
2 CONC e konge av Selevkideriket i 152 f.Kr.[7] Han utpekte Jonatan Apphus, en bror og etterfølger av Judas Makkabeus, som yppersteprest av Judea for å gjøre jødene som sine allierte. Jonatan, som kom fr
2 CONC a en prestefamilie, men ikke fra Sadoks slekt, tok tittelen i 152 f.Kr.[8] Da Demetrios fikk høre om dette, skrev han et brev hvor han overdro flere privilegier til Jonatan Apphus.[9] Jødene hadde g
2 CONC ode grunner til å mistro ham grunnet tidligere forfølgelser av jødene. De allierte seg med Balas som beseiret og drepte Demetrios i 150 f.Kr.[10]

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius I (Greek: Δημήτριος Α`, born 185 BC, reigned 161-150 BC), surnamed Soter (Greek: Σωτήρ - "Savior"), was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius was sent to Rome as a hostage during the reign of his father Seleucus IV Philopator and his mother Laodice IV. When his father was murdered by his finance minister Heliodorus in 175 BC., 
2 CONC his uncle Antiochus IV Epiphanes killed the usurper, but usurped the throne himself. When Antiochus IV died in 163 BC., his 9-year-old boy son Antiochus V Eupator was made king by Lysias. Demetrius wa
2 CONC s then 22 years old (thus he was born in 185 BC). He requested the Roman Senate to restore the Syrian throne to him, but was rejected, since the Romans believed that Syria should be ruled by a boy rat
2 CONC her than a man. Two years later, Antiochus V was greatly weakened because Rome sent an emissary to sink his ships and hamstring his elephants for his violation of the Peace of Apamea, storing up too m
2 CONC uch weaponry. Demetrius escaped from confinement and was welcomed back on the Syrian throne in 161 BC. He immediately killed Antiochus V and Lysias.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius I is infamous in Jewish history for his victory over the Maccabees, killing Judas Maccabaeus in Nisan, 160 BC. Demetrius acquired his surname of Soter, or Savior, from the Babylonians, wh
2 CONC om he delivered from the tyranny of the Median satrap, Timarchus. Timarchus, who had distinguished himself by defending Media against the emergent Parthians, seems to have treated Demetrius' accession
2 CONC  as an excuse to declare himself an independent king and extend his realm into Babylonia. His forces were however not enough for the legal Seleucid king: Demetrius defeated and killed Timarchus in 160
2 CONC  BC, and dethroned Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia. The Seleucid empire was temporarily united again. Demetrius may have married his sister Laodice V, by whom he had three sons Demetrius II Nicator, An
2 CONC tiochus VII Sidetes and Antigonus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius' downfall may be attributed to Heracleides, a surviving brother of the defeated rebel Timarchus, who championed the cause of Alexander Balas, a boy who claimed to be a natural son of Anti
2 CONC ochus IV Epiphanes. Heracleides convinced the Roman Senate to support the young pretender against Demetrius I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Jews also had a role in the down fall of Demetrius I. Alexander Balas came with a mercenary army, landed and occupied Ptolemais, and reigned as a rival king of the Seleucids in 152 BC. He appoi
2 CONC nted Jonathan Maccabaeus, the brother and successor of Judas Maccabaeus, as the high priest of Judea, in order to make the Jews his allies. Jonathan, who was born of a priestly family but not from Zad
2 CONC ok, the high priestly stock, took the title in Tishri, 152 BC.[9] When Demetrius heard of it, he wrote a letter granting more privileges to Jonathan (1 Macc. 10:25-45). The Jews did not believe in him
2 CONC , because of his past persecutions of the Jews. They joined with Balas, who defeated and killed Demetrius I in 150 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 1919 Constantine Cavafy published a poem about Demetrius's time as a hostage in Rome.

2 CONT <p>Laodice was a daughter of the Seleucid King Seleucus IV Philopator and his wife, Laodice IV. She had two brothers: Antiochus and Demetrius I Soter. She was born and raised in the Seleucid Empire.

2 CONT <p>Orontes IV (Armenian: Երվանդ Դ, Yervand IV) was the son of King Arsames and is recorded as ruling Armenia from inscriptions found at the historic capital of the Orontid dynasty, Armavir. In 
2 CONC his reign the religious site of Bagaran was founded. Large bronze statues in the Hellenistic style of the gods, Zeus (Aramazd), Artemis (Anahit) and Herakles (Vahagn) were brought there and set up in 
2 CONC temples dedicated to them. He is also said to have founded a shrine at Armavir dedicated to Apollo (Mithra), a golden statue of four horses pulling a chariot with Apollo as god of the Sun. This was la
2 CONC ter destroyed by the Sassanid Persian army in the 4th century AD.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>King Antiochus III instigated a revolt against King Orontes IV. Strabo, who wrote about this 200 years later, stated that it was general Artaxias I, who was also an Orontid, who overthrew King Oron
2 CONC tes IV. Aramaic inscriptions found at Armavir state that King Orontes IV died at the hands of his own army, in other words by betrayal from Artaxias I. This was most likely bribery of the Armenian arm
2 CONC y by King Antiochus III.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artaxias I took over as King of Armenia soon afterwards, according to Strabo. Orontes IV had a son, Ptolemaeus of Commagene, who served as the last Satrap of Commagene between 201-163 BC, became in
2 CONC  163 BC the first King of Commagene and died in 130 BC.

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice VI (flourished 2nd century BC, died 115–113 BC) was a Greek Seleucid Princess and through marriage was a Queen of the Kingdom of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice was the daughter born from the full blooded sibling union of the Seleucid Monarchs Antiochus IV Epiphanes and Laodice IV. Her grandparents were the Seleucid Monarchs Antiochus III the Great
2 CONC  and Laodice III. Through her mother’s previous marriages, she had various maternal half-brothers and sisters and two full blooded brothers who served as Seleucid Kings Antiochus V Eupator and Alexa
2 CONC nder Balas. In 152 BC, Laodice became one of the supporters for her brother Alexander Balas, who revolted and overthrew the Seleucid King Demetrius I Soter, who was their maternal half-brother/cousin.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After 152 BC, Laodice married King Mithridates V of Pontus,[2] who reigned from 150–120 BC. Mithridates V and Laodice VI were related, as her husband had lineage from the Seleucid dynasty. Little
2 CONC  is known regarding her relationship with her husband or her reign as Pontian Queen. During their marriage, Laodice bore Mithridates V seven children: Laodice of Cappadocia, Mithridates VI of Pontus, 
2 CONC Mithridates Chrestus, Laodice, Nysa (sometimes spelt as Nyssa), Roxana and Statira. Nysa, Roxana and Statira were put to death after the fall of the Kingdom of Pontus in 63 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates V was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held. In the will of Mithridates V, he left the Kingdom to the joint rule of Laodic
2 CONC e, Mithridates VI and Mithridates Chrestus. Both of her sons were underage to rule and Laodice retained all power as regent.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice in her regency favored her second son over her first son. During her regency 120–116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC), Mithridates VI escaped from the plotting of his mother and had gone in
2 CONC to hiding. She enjoyed luxuries that made her a compliant client of Rome. She accepted bribes from the Roman Republic and her extravagance pushed Pontus into debt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI between 116–113 BC returned to Pontus from hiding and was hailed King. He was able to remove his mother and his brother from the Pontian throne, thus Mithridates VI became the sole

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Satenik (Armenian: Սաթենիկ) was the name of the princess who married Artashes, the king of Armenia. Their love story, known as Artashes and Satenik, is presented by the Armenian historian Mo
2 CONC vses Khorenatsi in his History of Armenia. Movses noted that the story, which he directly quotes from, was a well-known epic during his time among the common people of Armenia told by traveling storyt
2 CONC ellers and minstrels. Satenik is a popular feminine name among Armenians today.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Background'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artashes, whose name is also seen in the Greek form as Artaxias, had risen to throne of Armenia in around 189 BC and was recognized as such by both Rome and Parthia. The invasion of the Kingdom of 
2 CONC Armenia by the Alans during the reign of King Artashes I (189-160 BC) serves as the backdrop of the romantic tale between Artashes and Satenik. Following their conquering of the lands of Georgia, the 
2 CONC Alans moved further southwards, crossing the Kur River and, effectively, into Armenia. Artashes gathered a large force to meet the Alanian threat and a fierce war took place between the two sides, res
2 CONC ulting in the capture of the young son of the Alanian king. The Alanians were forced to retreat back to the Kur river and there they set up a base camp on the northern side of the river. Meanwhile, Ar
2 CONC tashes' army pursued them and established their camp on the southern side of the Kur. The Alanian king asked for an eternal peace treaty to be concluded between his people and the Armenians and promis
2 CONC ed to give Artashes anything he wanted so long as he would release his son, but the Armenian king refused to do so.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Romance with Artashes'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At this time, Satenik came near the shore and, through an interpreter, called on Artashes to release her brother:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Classical Armenian''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''«Քեզ ասեմ, այր քաջ Արտաշէս,</p>

2 CONT <p>''I speak to you, oh brave Artashes, For you have defeated the brave Alan people; Come, listen, to the bright-eyed Alan princess And return the youth. For it is unbecoming of heroes To destroy the 
2 CONC liveliness of other great warriors Or to take and keep them in enslavement, So that two valiant peoples Are consigned to perpetual enmity.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hearing these words, Artashes traveled down to the river and upon seeing Satenik, was immediately captivated by her beauty.[6] Artashes called on one of his close military commanders, Smbat Bagratu
2 CONC ni, and confessing his desire for Satenik, expressed his willingness to conclude the treaty with the Alans and ordered Smbat to bring her to him. Smbat dispatched messengers to the Alanian king, who g
2 CONC ave the following reply:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''«Եւ ուստի տացէ քաջն Արտաշէս հազարս ի հազարաց եւ բիւրս ի բիւրուց ընդ քաջազգւոյ կոյս օրիորդիս Ալանաց»''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''"And whence shall brave Artashes give thousands upon thousands and tens of thousands upon tens of thousands for the maiden of the brave Alan people?"''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artashes remained undaunted and instead sought to abduct Satenik since bride abductions were considered more honorable during this period than formal acquiescence:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Classical Armenian''</p>

2 CONT <p>''«Հեծաւ արի արքայն Արտաշէս ի սեաւն գեղեցիկ, Եւ հանեալ զոսկէօղ շիկափոկ պարանն, Եւ անցեալ որպէս զարծուի սրաթե�

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Following Satenik's abduction, Artashes agreed to pay to the Alans vast amounts of gold and red leather, the latter of which, was highly valued material among the Alans. With this, the two kings co
2 CONC ncluded a peace treaty and a lavish and magnificent wedding took place. Movses stated that during the wedding a "golden shower rained down" on Artashes and a "pearl shower" rained down on Satenik. It 
2 CONC was a popular tradition among the Armenian kings, according to Movses, to stand in front of the entrance of a temple and drop money from above his head and to shower the queen's bedroom with pearls. T

2 CONT <p>ARTAXIAS I reigned 189-160 B.C., founder of the Artaxiad dynasty in Greater Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ARTAXIAS I (Arm. Artašēs), reigned 189-160 B.C., founder of the Artaxiad dynasty in Greater Armenia (Mec Haykʿ). At the end of the 3rd century, Armenia was a patchwork of 120 dynastic states cal
2 CONC led “kingdoms” (regna) by Pliny (Natural history 6.9); these were, presumably, the domains of local dynastic houses (Arm. naxarans), loosely united under the Orontid kings of Greater and Lesser Ar
2 CONC menia. Although Alexander had not conquered Armenia, the influence of Greek culture and Seleucid power was evident in the 3rd century B.C. In Greater Armenia, Antiochus appointed Artaxias as stratēgo
2 CONC s. In 191 B.C., Antiochus was defeated at Magnesia by the Romans, who confirmed their control over Asia Minor three years later by the treaty of Apamea. The two Armenian stratēgoi, rebelling against 
2 CONC Antiochus, “joined the Romans and were ranked as autonomous, with the title of king” (Strabo, Geography 11.14.15). In 95, the Artaxiad Tigran II (the Great) annexed Sophene; the Artaxiad dynasty w
2 CONC as to last until the first decade of the Christian era.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In his History of the Armenians 2.56, Movsēs Xorenacʿi describes in accurate detail the stone boundary-steles that Artaxias caused to be erected on the lands belonging to towns and estates (Arm. 
2 CONC agarak-kʿ); perpetual boundary litigation, motivated by the fear of crop failure and starvation, was a marked feature of life in many lands during the Hellenistic period. A large number of these stel
2 CONC es have been found, with inscriptions in Aramaic. The name of the king, ʾRTḤŠS[Y] in the inscriptions, corresponds to the Aramaic form of the name of the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes in an inscripti
2 CONC on of the first half of the 3rd century B.C. from Naqš-e Rostam, and the use of Aramaic may be seen as a survival of the chancellery Aramaic of the Achaemenid administration in Armenia, although the 
2 CONC steles appear to be an innovation of Artaxias, for none have been found of earlier rulers. Artaxias calls himself MLK RWNDKN (or ʾRWND[KN]) “Orontid king”; the ending -akān, attested in classica
2 CONC l sources for Old Persian, is widely employed in the Parthian ostraca from Nisa and in later Armenian texts. Although Artaxias had overthrown Orontes, he based his claim to legitimacy on his presumed 
2 CONC Orontid lineage; this attitude accords at once with both Iranian and Armenian conceptions: certain status was inherited by blood, but could not be acquired.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although Movsēs Xorenacʿi (2.49) mentions that Artaxias built a temple (mehean) in Artaxata to which he transferred statues of Artemis (i.e., Anahit, see Armenian religion) and the royal ancestor
2 CONC s from the Orontid holy city of Bagawan, no temples have been found. Terra-cotta figurines have been unearthed which probably depict the Anatolian divine pair, Cybele and Attis, and a large number of 
2 CONC terra-cotta bas-reliefs of a rider in Parthian dress may represent the Zoroastrian yazata Mithra. A single word in Greek uncials, probably to be read PHOYHNA, *Rēvēna, is incised into one terra-cott
2 CONC a pediment from which the figurine is missing; it may be a proper name, based on Mid. Ir. rēw “rich,” an important attribute of Ahura Mazdā.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nearly all the Artaxiads minted coins, unlike the Orontids, to whom only a few coins are attributed, and those only tentatively. One Artaxiad coin depicts on the reverse an eagle standing on a moun
2 CONC tain-top; the same scene appears on a Cappadocian coin, where the mountain has been identified as Argaeus which towers over the city of Caesarea/Mazaca, (Turkish Kayseri), which was worshipped as sacr
2 CONC ed. In the Armenian case, the mountain shown may be Ararat, which the Armenians held in similar sanctity. Figurines of eagles perched atop mountains, in bronze and terra-cotta, have been found in Arme
2 CONC nia and elsewhere in Asia Minor. The eagle, a symbol of royalty in many cultures, may represent here the Kayanian xᵛarənah- of Zoroastrianism; it appears also on the Artaxiad royal tiara.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artaxias was married to Satenik, daughter of the king of Alans. They had six sons: Artavasdes (Artavazd), Vruyr, Mazhan, Zariadres (Zareh), Tiran and Tigranes (Tigran). Artaxias founded a capital,

2 CONT <p> It is said that when Hannibal fled from the Romans and came to Armenia, he suggested different projects to the Armenian king and taught him several useful things. When he saw the beautiful landsca

2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By the end of the 3rd century BC, the kingdom of Armenia was made up of around 120 dynastic domains ruled by nakharars, loosely united under the Orontid kings of Greater and Lesser Armenia. Even th

2 CONC tegos.

2 CONT <p>Following his monarch's defeat by the Romans at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, Artaxias and his co-strategos Zariadres revolted and, with Roman consent, began to reign autonomously with the titl

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy IV Philopator (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Φιλοπάτωρ, Ptolemaĩos Philopátōr, reigned 221-205 BCE), son of Ptolemy III and Berenice II of Egypt was the fourth Pharaoh of the Pto

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His reign was inaugurated by the murder of his mother, and he was always under the dominion of favourites, male and female, who indulged his vices and conducted the government as they pleased. Self
2 CONC -interest led his ministers to make serious preparations to meet the attacks of Antiochus III the Great on Coele-Syria including Judea, and the great Egyptian victory of Raphia (217), where Ptolemy hi
2 CONC mself was present, secured the northern borders of the kingdom for the remainder of his reign.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The arming of Egyptians in this campaign had a disturbing effect upon the native population of Egypt, leading to the secession of Upper Egypt under pharaohs Harmachis (also known as Hugronaphor) an
2 CONC d Ankmachis (also known as Chaonnophris), thus creating a kingdom that occupied much of the country and lasted nearly twenty years.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Philopator was devoted to orgiastic forms of religion and literary dilettantism. He built a temple to Homer and composed a tragedy, to which his favourite Agathocles added a commentary. He married 
2 CONC (about 220 BC) his sister Arsinoë III, but continued to be ruled by his mistress Agathoclea, sister of Agathocles.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy is said to have built a giant ship known as the tessarakonteres ("forty"), a huge type of galley. The forty of its name may refer to its number of banks of oars. The only recorded instance 
2 CONC of this type of vessel, in fact, is this showpiece galley built for Ptolemy IV, described by Callixenus of Rhodes, writing in the 3rd century BCE, and by Athenaeus in the 2nd century AD. Plutarch also
2 CONC  mentions that Ptolemy Philopater owned this immense vessel in his Life of Demetrios. The current theory is that Ptolemy's ship was an oversize catamaran galley, measuring 128 m 420 ft.

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy IV's reign was also marked by trade with other contemporaneous polities. In the 1930s, excavations by Mattingly at a fortress close to Port Dunford (the likely Nikon of antiquity) in presen

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Antiochus III the Great, (Greek Ἀντίoχoς Μέγας; ca. 241–187 BC, ruled 222–187 BC), younger son of Seleucus II Callinicus, became the 6th ruler of the Seleucid Empire as
2 CONC  a youth of about eighteen in 223 BC. Ascending the throne at young age, Antiochus was an ambitious ruler. Although his early attempts in war against the Ptolemaic Kingdom were unsuccessful, in the fo
2 CONC llowing years of conquest Antiochus proved himself as the most successful Seleucid King after Seleucus I himself. His traditional designation, the Great, reflects an epithet he briefly assumed after h
2 CONC is Eastern Campaign (it appears in regnal formulas at Amyzon in 203 and 202 BC, but not later). Antiochos also assumed the title "Basileus Megas" (which is Greek for Great King), the traditional title
2 CONC  of the Persian kings, which he adopted after his conquest of Koile Syria.

2 CONT <p>The 6th ruler of the Seleucid Empire, Antiochus III the Great (Greek: Ἀντίoχoς Μέγας; ca. 241–187 BC, ruled 222–187 BC) Seleucid Greek king[1][2][3] ruled over Greater Syria and wes

2 CONC Antiochus gained several military victories. His traditional designation, the Great, reflects an epithet he briefly assumed. He also assumed the title "Basileus Megas" (which is Greek for "Great King"
2 CONC ), the traditional title of the Persian kings.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Self-declaring himself the "champion of Greek freedom against Roman domination", Antiochus III waged a war against the Roman Republic in mainland Greece in autumn of 192 BC[4][5] only to be defeate

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III was a member of the Greek-Macedonian Seleucid dynasty,[6][7][8][9] he was the son of king Seleucus II and Laodice II and was born in 242 BC near Susa in Iran.[10] Antiochus succeeded 
2 CONC his brother Seleucus III as the king of the Seleucid Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III inherited a disorganized state. Not only had Asia Minor become detached, but the easternmost provinces had broken away, Bactria under the Greek Diodotus of Bactria, and Parthia under 
2 CONC the nomad chieftain Arsaces. Soon after Antiochus's accession, Media and Persis revolted under their governors, the brothers Molon and Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The young king, under the baneful influence of the minister Hermeias, authorised an attack on Ptolemaic Syria instead of going in person to face the rebels. The attack against Egypt of the Ptolemie
2 CONC s proved a fiasco, and the generals sent against Molon and Alexander met with disaster. Only in Asia Minor, where the king's cousin, the able Achaeus represented the Seleucid cause, did its prestige r
2 CONC ecover, driving the Pergamene power back to its earlier limits.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 221 BC Antiochus at last went east, and the rebellion of Molon and Alexander collapsed which Polybios attributes in part to his following the advice of Zeuxis‎ rather than Hermeias.[11] The su
2 CONC bmission of Lesser Media, which had asserted its independence under Artabazanes, followed. Antiochus rid himself of Hermeias by assassination and returned to Syria (220 BC). Meanwhile Achaeus himself 
2 CONC had revolted and assumed the title of king in Asia Minor. Since, however, his power was not well enough grounded to allow an attack on Syria, Antiochus considered that he might leave Achaeus for the p
2 CONC resent and renew his attempt on Ptolemaic Syria.

2 CONT <p>Sølvmynt med Antiochos III</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiokos III var et medlem av det gresk-makedonske selevkiddynastiet.[6][7] Han var den yngre sønnen av Selevkos II Kallinikos og Laodike II, og ble født ca. 242 f.Kr. i nærheten av Susa i det s
2 CONC om i dag er Iran.[8] Han etterfulgte sin bror Selevkos III Keraunos i 223 f.Kr. som konge av Selevkideriket.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Han arvet et uorganisert og kaotisk rike. Ikke bare hadde Anatolia blitt løsrevet, men de østlige provinsene hadde brutt ut, Baktria under greske Diodotos, og Partia under høvdingen Arsakes. Kor
2 CONC t tid etter at han kom på tronen gjorde Media og Persis opprør under sine satraper (guvernører), brødrene Molon og Aleksander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den unge kongen, under skadelig innflytelse fra ministeren Hermeias (som han arvet fra sin fars styre), ledet et angrep mot ptolemeisk Syria framfor å møte opprørerne personlig. Angrepet mot Egy
2 CONC pt ble en fiasko og de hærene som ble sendt mot Molon og Aleksander ble en katastrofe. Kun i Anatolia hvor kongens fetter, den dyktige hærføreren Akaios, representerte Selevkiderikets sak, var det 
2 CONC klare bedringer. Han fordrev styrkene til Pergamon tilbake til dets tidligere grenser.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I 221 f.Kr. dro Antiokos III til sist østover og opprøret til Molon og Aleksander falt sammen, noe historikeren Polybios har tilskrevet delvis til at han fulgte rådene til hærføreren Zeuxis fr
2 CONC amfor å lytte til Hermeias.[9] Underkastelsen av Media, som hadde tatt uavhengighet under Artabazanes, fulgte. Antiokos III kvittet seg med Hermeias ved å få ham myrdet og dro tilbake til Syria i 2
2 CONC 20 f.Kr. I mellomtiden hadde Akaios selv gjort opprør og tatt tittelen som konge i Anatolia. Ettersom hans makt ikke var godt nok fundert til å kunne angripe Syria, besluttet Antiokos å la ham vær
2 CONC e for øyeblikket og gjorde et nytt forsøk på å gjenerobre ptolemeiske Syria.

2 CONC gangen han hittil hadde hatt og tvang ham til å trekke seg tilbake til nord for dagens Libanon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I 216 f.Kr. marsjerte Antiokos' hær inn i vestlige Anatolia for å slå ned det lokal opprøret som var ledet av hans fetter Akaios, og ved 214 f.Kr. hadde han drevet ham fra området og til Sardi
2 CONC s. Etter å ha tatt fetteren til fange ble han henrettet. Festningen greide å holde ut fram til 213 f.Kr. under Akaios' enke Leodike som overga senere.[10]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Etter å ha gjenvunnet de sentrale delene av Anatolia (mens han måtte tolerere kongedømmene i Pergamon, Bitynia, og Kappadokia), vendte Antiokos seg mot å gjenvinne de fjerntliggende provinsene 
2 CONC i nord og øst. Han tvang Xerxes av Armenia til å anerkjenne hans overherredømme i 212 f.Kr. I 209 hadde han invadert Partia, okkupert hovedstaden Hekatompylos (i dag byen Schahr-e Qumis i Iran) og 
2 CONC presset seg videre inn i Hyrkania. Den partiske kong Arsakes II forhandlet seg til en fredsavtale.

2 CONT <p>«Han krysset Kaukasus (Hindu Kush) og gikk ned inn i India; fornyet sitt vennskap med Sophagasenas, indernes konge; mottok flere elefanter inntil han et hundre og femti til sammen; og etter å ha

2 CONT <p>Fra byen Seleukia ved Tigirs ledet Antiokos en kort militær ekspedisjon ned i Persiabukten mot byen Gerrha ved den arabiske kysten i 205/204 f.Kr. Strabon har beskrevet denne byen som svært rik v

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiokos synes å ha gjenopprettet Selevkideriket i øst, noe som skaffet ham tittelen «den store» (Antiochos Megas). Også i 205/204 f.Kr. etterfulgte Ptolemaios V Epifanes som kun et spedbarn p

2 CONT <p>Atter en gang angrep Antiokos den ptolemeiske provinsen Koilesyria og Fønikia, og ved 199 f.Kr. synes han å ha tatt besittelse av området før hærføreren Skopas fra Aitolia gjenerobret det for
2 CONC  Egypt. Men denne gjenerobringen var kortvarig. I 198 f.Kr. klarte Antiokos å beseire Skopas i slaget ved Paneion (i nærheten av Banias/Paneas ved foten av Hermonfjellet). Dette nederlaget betydde s

2 CONT <p>Antiokos forflyttet seg deretter til Anatolia både til lands og til havs for å sikre kystbyene som tilhørte levningene av ptolemeiske oversjøiske besittelser og de uavhengige greske byene. Dett
2 CONC e alarmerte den romerske republikk ettersom de greske byene Smyrna og Lampsakos appellerte til Roma om hjelp. Den politiske spenningen i Anatolia vokste etter at Antiokos i 196 f.Kr. etablerte et fotf

2 CONC  videre inn i Europa.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I 192 f.Kr. invaderte Antiokos Hellas med en hær på 10 000 menn og ble derfor valgt til øverstkommanderende av det aitoliske forbundet. Antiokos skulle bli den store greske frigjøreren. [14] I 
2 CONC 191 f.Kr. møtte han romerne, ledet av Manius Acilius Glabrio, som lyktes avskjære Antiokos fra sine forsterkninger i Trakia, og møtte ham til slag ved Thermopylene. Romerne hadde en styrke som var 
2 CONC dobbelt så stor, og med sine gjenværende tropper klarte Antiokos å flykte til Khalkis på Euboia, og derfra dro han over havet til Efesos. Romerne fulgte opp sin suksess med å invadere Antaolia, o
2 CONC g ledet av Scipio Asiaticus var det igjen seierrike i det avgjørende slaget ved Magnesia i 190 f.Kr. Igjen var romerne tallmessig overlegne. Samtidig ble Hannibal beseiret i et sjøslag utenfor Side 
2 CONC i Pamfylia. Det la Anatolia åpent for romerne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Med den ydmykende freden i Apameia i 188 f.Kr. ble Antiokos III tvunget til å oppgi alle sine erobringer i Europa, alt land vest for Taurusfjellene i Anatolia, overgi hele sine flåte med unntak a
2 CONC v tolv triremer, overgi alle sine krigselefanter, og betale en krigserstatning på 15 000 sølvtalenter. De landområdene i Anatolia ble fordelt blant Romas allierte. En annen konsekvens av dette nede
2 CONC rlaget i vest var at alle de fjerne provinsene i øst som Antiokos hadde sikret seg, igjen grep anledningen av det svekkede Selevkideriket med å erklære sin uavhengighet. Antiokos dro på et ny mili

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III the Great (Greek: Ἀντίoχoς Μέγας; c. 241-187 BC, ruled 222-187 BC) was a Hellenistic Greek king and the 6th ruler of the Seleucid Empire. He ruled over the region of Syria
2 CONC  and large parts of the rest of western Asia towards the end of the 3rd century BC. Rising to the throne at the age of eighteen in 222 BC, his early campaigns against the Ptolemaic Kingdom were unsucc
2 CONC essful, but in the following years Antiochus gained several military victories and substantially expanded the empire's territory. His traditional designation, the Great, reflects an epithet he assumed
2 CONC . He also assumed the title Basileus Megas (Greek for "Great King"), the traditional title of the Persian kings. A militarily active ruler, Antiochus restored much of the territory of the Seleucid Emp
2 CONC ire, before suffering a serious setback, towards the end of his reign, in his war against Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Declaring himself the "champion of Greek freedom against Roman domination", Antiochus III waged a four-year war against the Roman Republic in mainland Greece in autumn of 192 BC before being decisi
2 CONC vely defeated at the Battle of Magnesia. He died three years later on campaign in the east.

2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Background and early career''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III was a member of the Hellenistic Greek Seleucid dynasty. He was the son of king Seleucus II Callinicus and Laodice II and was born around 242 BC near Susa in Persia. He may have borne 
2 CONC a non-dynastic name (starting with Ly-), according to a Babylonian chronicle. He succeeded, under the name Antiochus, his brother Seleucus III Ceraunus, upon the latter's murder in Anatolia; he was in
2 CONC  Babylon at the time.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III inherited a disorganized state. Not only had Asia Minor become detached, but the easternmost provinces had broken away, Bactria under the Greek Diodotus of Bactria, and Parthia under 
2 CONC the nomad chieftain Arsaces. Soon after Antiochus's accession, Media and Persis revolted under their governors, the brothers Molon and Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The young king, under the influence of the minister Hermeias, headed an attack on Ptolemaic Syria instead of going in person to face the rebels. The attack against the Ptolemaic empire proved a fia
2 CONC sco, and the generals sent against Molon and Alexander met with disaster. Only in Asia Minor, where the king's cousin, Achaeus, represented the Seleucid cause, did its prestige recover, driving the Pe
2 CONC rgamene power back to its earlier limits.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 221 BC Antiochus at last went east, and the rebellion of Molon and Alexander collapsed which Polybios attributes in part to his following the advice of Zeuxis rather than Hermeias. The submissio
2 CONC n of Lesser Media, which had asserted its independence under Artabazanes, followed. Antiochus rid himself of Hermeias by assassination and returned to Syria (220 BC). Meanwhile, Achaeus himself had re
2 CONC volted and assumed the title of king in Asia Minor. Since, however, his power was not well enough grounded to allow an attack on Syria, Antiochus considered that he might leave Achaeus for the present
2 CONC  and renew his attempt on Ptolemaic Syria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Early wars against other Hellenistic rulers'' The campaigns of 219 BC and 218 BC carried the Seleucid armies almost to the confines of Ptolemaic Kingdom, but in 217 BC Ptolemy IV defeated Antioch
2 CONC us at the Battle of Raphia. This defeat nullified all Antiochus's successes and compelled him to withdraw north of the Lebanon. Despite the military defeat, Antiochus was able to keep control of Seleu
2 CONC cia pieria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 216 BC Antiochus' army marched into western Anatolia to suppress the local rebellion led by Antiochus' own cousin Achaeus, and had by 214 BC driven him from the field into Sardis. Capturing Acha
2 CONC eus, Antiochus had him executed. The citadel managed to hold out until 213 BC under Achaeus' widow Laodice who surrendered later.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Having thus recovered the central part of Asia Minor (for the Seleucid government had perforce to tolerate the dynasties in Pergamon, Bithynia and Cappadocia) Antiochus turned to recovering the out
2 CONC lying provinces of the north and east. He obliged Xerxes of Armenia to acknowledge his supremacy in 212 BC. In 209 BC Antiochus invaded Parthia, occupied the capital Hecatompylos and pushed forward in
2 CONC to Hyrcania. The Parthian king Arsaces II apparently successfully sued for peace.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Bactrian campaign and Indian expedition''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The year 209 BC saw Antiochus in Bactria, where the Greco-Bactrian king Euthydemus I had supplanted the original rebel. Antiochus again met with success. Euthydemus was defeated by Antiochus at the
2 CONC  Battle of the Arius but after sustaining a famous siege in his capital Bactra (Balkh), he obtained an honourable peace by which Antiochus promised Euthydemus' son Demetrius the hand of one of his dau
2 CONC ghters.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus next, following in the steps of Alexander, crossed into the Kabul valley, reaching the realm of Indian king Sophagasenus and returned west by way of Seistan and Kerman (206/5). According 
2 CONC to Polybius:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''He crossed the Caucasus (Hindu Kush) and descended into India; renewed his friendship with Sophagasenus (Subhashsena in Prakrit) the king of the Indians; received more elephants, until he had a h
2 CONC undred and fifty altogether; and having once more provisioned his troops, set out again personally with his army: leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king h
2 CONC ad agreed to hand over to him.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Persia and Coele Syria campaigns''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From Seleucia on the Tigris he led a short expedition down the Persian Gulf against the Gerrhaeans of the Arabian coast (205 BC/204 BC). Antiochus seemed to have restored the Seleucid empire in the
2 CONC  east, which earned him the title of "the Great" (Antiochos Megas). In 205/204 BC the infant Ptolemy V Epiphanes succeeded to the Egyptian throne, and Antiochus is said (notably by Polybios) to have c
2 CONC oncluded a secret pact with Philip V of Macedon for the partition of the Ptolemaic possessions. Under the terms of this pact, Macedon were to receive the Ptolemaic possessions around the Aegean Sea an
2 CONC d Cyrene, while Antiochus would annex Cyprus and Egypt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Once more Antiochus attacked the Ptolemaic province of Coele Syria and Phoenicia, and by 199 BC he seems to have had possession of it before the Aetolian leader Scopas recovered it for Ptolemy. But
2 CONC  that recovery proved brief, for in 198 BC Antiochus defeated Scopas at the Battle of Panium, near the sources of the Jordan, a battle which marks the end of Ptolemaic rule in Judea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''War against Rome and death''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus then moved to Asia Minor, by land and by sea, to secure the coast towns which belonged to the remnants of Ptolemaic overseas dominions and the independent Greek cities. This enterprise ea
2 CONC rned him the antagonism of the Roman Republic, since Smyrna and Lampsacus appealed to the republic of the west at the time when it was claiming to defend Greek freedom, and the tension grew after Anti
2 CONC ochus had in 196 BC established a footing in Thrace. The evacuation of Greece by the Romans gave Antiochus his opportunity, and he now had the fugitive Hannibal at his court to urge him on.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 192 BC Antiochus invaded Greece with a 10,000 man army, and was elected the commander in chief of the Aetolian League.[16] In 191 BC, however, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him 
2 CONC at Thermopylae, forcing him to withdraw to Asia Minor. The Romans followed up their success by invading Anatolia, and the decisive victory of Scipio Asiaticus at Magnesia ad Sipylum (190 BC), followin
2 CONC g the defeat of Hannibal at sea off Side, delivered Asia Minor into their hands.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By the Treaty of Apamea (188 BC) Antiochus abandoned all the country north and west of the Taurus, most of which the Roman Republic gave either to Rhodes or to the Attalid ruler Eumenes II, its all
2 CONC ies (many Greek cities were left free). As a consequence of this blow to the Seleucid power, the outlying provinces of the empire, recovered by Antiochus, reasserted their independence. Antiochus moun

2 CONT <p>'''Family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 222 BC, Antiochus III married Princess Laodice of Pontus, a daughter of King Mithridates II of Pontus and Princess Laodice of the Seleucid Empire. The couple were first cousins through their mut
2 CONC ual grandfather, Antiochus II Theos. Antiochus and Laodice had eight children (three sons and five daughters):
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p># Antiochus (221–193 BC), Antiochus III's first heir apparent and joint-king with his father from 210–193 BC
2 CONT <p># Seleucus IV Philopator (c. 220 – 175 BC), Antiochus III's successor</p>
2 CONT <p># Ardys</p>
2 CONT <p># unnamed daughter, betrothed in about 206 BC to Demetrius I of Bactria</p>
2 CONT <p># Laodice IV, married all three of her brothers in succession and became Queen of the Seleucid Empire through her second and third marriages
2 CONT <p># Cleopatra I Syra (c. 204 – 176 BC), married in 193 BC Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt
2 CONT <p># Antiochis, married in 194 BC King Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia</p>
2 CONT <p># Mithridates (215–164 BC), succeeded his brother Seleucus IV Philopator in 175 BC under the regnal name Antiochus IV Epiphanes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 191 BC, Antiochus III married a girl from Chalcis, whom he named "Euboea". They had no children. Laodike III may have fallen in disgrace; however, she clearly survived Antiochus III, and appears
2 CONC  in Susa in 183 BC
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Antiochus and the Jews'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III resettled 2000 Jewish families from Babylonia into the Hellenistic Anatolian regions of Lydia and Phrygia. He is not the king of the Hanukkah story who was resisted by the Maccabees; 
2 CONC rather, that was his son, Antiochus IV. On the contrary, Josephus portrays him as friendly towards the Jews of Jerusalem and cognizant of their loyalty to him (see Antiquities, chapter 3, sections 3-4
2 CONC ), in stark contrast to the attitude of his son. In fact, Antiochus III lowered taxes, granted subventions to the Temple, and let the Jews live, as Josephus puts it, "according to the law of their for
2 CONC efathers."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Cultural portrayals'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Caroline era play Believe as You List is centered around Antiochus' resistance to the Romans after the Battle of Thermopylae. The play was originally about Sebastian of Portugal surviving the B
2 CONC attle of Alcazar and returning, trying to gather support to return to the throne. This first version was censored for being considered "subversive" because it portrayed Sebastian being deposed, its co
2 CONC mments in favor of an Anglo-Spanish alliance and possible pro-Catholicism, which led to the final version changing to the story of Antiochus (which led to historical inaccuracy in exaggerating his def
2 CONC eat at that phase in history to fit the earlier text), turning Spaniards into Romans and the Catholic eremite into a Stoic philosopher.

2 CONT <p>Selevkos var forhindret av økonomiske vanskeligheter til å utøve en ambisiøs politikk, skapt delvis ved store utgifter i krigen som hans far hadde drevet og ved at han måtte betale krigserstat

2 CONT <p>I et forsøk for på å samle inn penger for å betale romerne, sendte han en gang rundt i 175 f.Kr. sin minister og rikskansler Heliodoros til Jerusalem, jødenes hellige sted, for å ta tempelska

2 CONC 2] I Israel Museum i Jerusalem finnes det en gresk inskripsjon på en stele som er datert til 178 f.Kr. hvor det nevnes at Selevkos utpekte Heliodoros som hans visekonge med ansvar for templene i Jude
2 CONC a. Mens denne delen av inskripsjonen kommer fra handel med oldtidsgjenstander, ble det i 2005 funnet ytterligere et fragment fra den samme inskripsjonen i kjelleren av et hellenistisk hus i Maresha i

2 CONC odice IV, by whom he had three children: two sons Antiochus, Demetrius I Soter and a daughter Laodice V.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was compelled by financial necessities, created in part by the heavy war-indemnity exacted by Rome, to pursue an ambitious policy. In an effort to collect money to pay the Romans, he sent his mi
2 CONC nister Heliodorus to Jerusalem to seize the Jewish temple treasury.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Bible tells of a prophecy given by a messenger angel in Daniel 11:20 (NLT). The text states that Seleucus "will be remembered as the king who sent a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor
2 CONC ." The deuterocanonical lends more to this in 2 Maccabees 3:2-3... "It came to pass that even the kings themselves, and the princes esteemed the place [the Temple in Jerusalem] worthy of the highest h
2 CONC onour, and glorified the temple with very great gifts: So that Seleucus king of Asia allowed out of his revenues all the charges belonging to the ministry of the sacrifices."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On his return from Jerusalem, Heliodorus assassinated Seleucus, and seized the throne for himself. The true heir Demetrius, son of Seleucus, was now being retained in Rome as a hostage, and the kin
2 CONC gdom was seized by the younger brother of Seleucus, Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Antiochus managed to oust Heliodorus and an infant son of Seleucus, also named Antiochus, was formal head of state for a few
2 CONC  years until Epiphanes had him murdered.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus IV Epiphanes (/ænˈtaɪ.əkəs ɛˈpɪfəniːz/; Ancient Greek: Ἀντίοχος Δ΄ ὁ Ἐπιφανής, Antíochos D' ho Epiphanḗs, "God Manifest";[1] c. 215 BC-164 BC) was a Hel
2 CONC lenistic Greek king of the Seleucid Empire from 175 BC until his death in 164 BC. He was a son of King Antiochus III the Great. His original name was Mithradates (alternative form Mithridates); he ass
2 CONC umed the name Antiochus after he ascended the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notable events during the reign of Antiochus IV include his near-conquest of Egypt, his persecution of the Jews of Judea and Samaria, and the rebellion of the Jewish Maccabees.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus was the first Seleucid king to use divine epithets on coins, perhaps inspired by the Bactrian Hellenistic kings who had earlier done so, or else building on the ruler cult that his father
2 CONC  Antiochus the Great had codified within the Seleucid Empire. These epithets included Θεὸς Ἐπιφανής 'manifest god', and, after his defeat of Egypt, Νικηφόρος 'bringer of victory
2 CONC '. However, Antiochus also tried to interact with common people by appearing in the public bath houses and applying for municipal offices, and his often eccentric behavior and capricious actions led s
2 CONC ome of his contemporaries to call him Epimanes ("The Mad One"), a word play on his title Epiphanes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Rise to power'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus was a member of the Hellenistic Greek Seleucid dynasty and was the son and potential successor of King Antiochus III, and as such he became a political hostage of the Roman Republic follo
2 CONC wing the Peace of Apamea in 188 BC. His older brother Seleucus IV followed his father onto the throne in 187 BC, and Antiochus was exchanged for his nephew Demetrius I Soter (the son and heir of Seleu
2 CONC cus). King Seleucus was assassinated by the usurper Heliodorus in 175 BC, but Antiochus in turn ousted him. Seleucus' legitimate heir Demetrius I Soter was still a hostage in Rome, so Antiochus seized
2 CONC  the throne for himself with the help of King Eumenes II of Pergamum, proclaiming himself co-regent with another son of Seleucus, an infant named Antiochus (whom he then murdered a few years later).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Wars against Egypt'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The guardians of King Ptolemy VI of Egypt demanded the return of Coele-Syria in 170 BC, but Antiochus launched a preemptive strike against Egypt, conquering all but Alexandria and capturing King Pt
2 CONC olemy. To avoid alarming Rome, Antiochus allowed Ptolemy VI to continue ruling as a puppet king. Upon Antiochus' withdrawal, the city of Alexandria chose a new king, one of Ptolemy's brothers, also na
2 CONC med Ptolemy (VIII Euergetes). The Ptolemy brothers agreed to rule Egypt jointly instead of fighting a civil war.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 168 BC, Antiochus led a second attack on Egypt and also sent a fleet to capture Cyprus. Before reaching Alexandria, his path was blocked by a single old Roman ambassador named Gaius Popillius La
2 CONC enas who delivered a message from the Roman Senate directing Antiochus to withdraw his armies from Egypt and Cyprus, or consider himself in a state of war with the Roman Republic. Antiochus said that 
2 CONC he would discuss it with his council, whereupon the Roman envoy drew a line in the sand around Antiochus and said: "Before you cross this circle, I want you to give me a reply for the Roman Senate." T
2 CONC his implied that Rome would declare war if the King stepped out of the circle without committing to leave Egypt immediately. Weighing his options, Antiochus decided to withdraw. Only then did Popilliu
2 CONC s agree to shake hands with him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Persecution of Jews, Maccabean revolt'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a mild suzerainty over Judea: they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus 
2 CONC IV, resulting in harsh persecutions and a revolt against his rule, the Maccabean revolt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the authors of the Books of Maccabees, while Antiochus was busy in Egypt, a rumor spread that he had been killed. In Judea, the deposed High Priest Jason gathered a force of 1,000 sold
2 CONC iers and made a surprise attack on the city of Jerusalem. Menelaus, the High Priest appointed by Antiochus, was forced to flee Jerusalem during a riot. King Antiochus returned from Egypt in 167 BC, en
2 CONC raged by his defeat; he attacked Jerusalem and restored Menelaus, then executed many Jews.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''When these happenings were reported to the king, he thought that Judea was in revolt. Raging like a wild animal, he set out from Egypt and took Jerusalem by storm. He ordered his soldiers to cut 
2 CONC down without mercy those whom they met and to slay those who took refuge in their houses. There was a massacre of young and old, a killing of women and children, a slaughter of virgins and infants. In
2 CONC  the space of three days, eighty thousand were lost, forty thousand meeting a violent death, and the same number being sold into slavery. — 2 Maccabees 5:11–14''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus decided to side with the Hellenized Jews in order to consolidate his empire and to strengthen his hold over the region. He outlawed Jewish religious rites and traditions kept by observant
2 CONC  Jews and ordered the worship of Zeus as the supreme god (2 Maccabees 6:1–12). This was anathema to the Jews and they refused, so Antiochus sent an army to enforce his decree. The city of Jerusalem 
2 CONC was destroyed (168 BC) because of the resistance, many were slaughtered, and Antiochus established a military Greek citadel called the Acra.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Traditionally, as expressed in the First and Second Books of the Maccabees, the Maccabean Revolt was painted as a national resistance to a foreign political and cultural oppression. In modern times
2 CONC , however, scholars have argued that the king was instead intervening in a civil war between the traditionalist Jews in the country and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem. According to Joseph P. Schultz
2 CONC :
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''"Modern scholarship on the other hand considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the Jewish ca
2 CONC mp."''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It seems that the traditionalists, with Hebrew/Aramaic names such as Onias, contested with the Hellenizers, with Greek names such as Jason and Menelaus, over who would be the High Priest. Other aut
2 CONC hors have pointed to the possibility of socioeconomic motives, as well as religious ones, as having been primary drivers of the civil war.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>What began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists. As the conflict escalated, Ant
2 CONC iochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices around which the traditionalists had rallied. This could explain why the king banned the traditional religion of a whole 
2 CONC people, in a total departure from typical Seleucid practice in other settings.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Final years'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>King Mithridates I of Parthia took advantage of Antiochus' western problems and attacked from the east, seizing the city of Herat in 167 BC and disrupting the direct trade route to India, effective
2 CONC ly splitting the Greek world in two.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus recognized the potential danger in the east but was unwilling to give up control of Judea. He sent a commander named Lysias to deal with the Maccabees, while the King himself led the main
2 CONC  Seleucid army against the Parthians. Antiochus had initial success in his eastern campaign, including the reoccupation of Armenia, but he died suddenly of disease in 164 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the scroll of Antiochus, when Antiochus heard that his army had been defeated in Judea, he boarded a ship and fled to the coastal cities. Wherever he came the people rebelled and calle
2 CONC d him "The Fugitive," so he drowned himself in the sea. According to the second book of maccabees, he died in the following manner : "But the all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel , struck him an incurab
2 CONC le and unseen blow. As soon as he ceased speaking he was seized with a pain in his bowels for which there was no relief and with sharp internal tortures - and that very justly, for he had tortured the
2 CONC  bowels of others with many and strange inflictions. Yet he did not in any way stop his insolence, but was even more filled with arrogance, breathing fire in his rage against the Jews, and giving orde
2 CONC rs to hasten the journey. And so it came about that he fell out of his chariot as it was rushing along, and the fall was so hard as to torture every limb of his body."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Jewish tradition'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus IV ruled the Jews from 175 to 164 BC. He is remembered as a major villain and persecutor in the Jewish traditions associated with Hanukkah, including the books of Maccabees and the "Scrol
2 CONC l of Antiochus". Rabbinical sources refer to him as הרשע harasha ("the wicked"); the Jewish Encyclopedia concluded that "[s]ince Jewish and heathen sources agree in their characterization of him, 
2 CONC their portrayal is evidently correct", summarizing this portrayal as one of a cruel and vainglorious ruler who tried to force on all the peoples of his realm a Hellenic culture, "the true essence of w
2 CONC hich he can scarcely be said to have appreciated".[24] Whether Antiochus's policy was directed at extermination of Judaism as a culture and a religion, though, is debatable on the grounds that his per
2 CONC secution was limited to Judea and Samaria (Jews in the diaspora were exempt), and that Antiochus was hardly an ideologically motivated Hellenizer. Erich S. Gruen suggests that, instead, he was driven 
2 CONC more by pragmatics such as the need to gather income from Judea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus has been identified as the "eleventh horn of the beast" in the Book of Daniel (chapters 7 to 12).

2 CONT <p>Armenien förklarade sig självständigt den 23 augusti 1990 efter Sovjetunionens kollaps och tog då avstånd från kommunismen; landet erkändes 21 september 1991. 1988, tre år innan Sovjetunion
2 CONC ens kollaps, krävde den högsta sovjeten Nagorno-Karabach att denna autonoma enklav skulle brytas ut ur sovjetrepubliken Azerbajdzan och anslutas till Armeniska SSR. Beslutet avslogs både av sovjete
2 CONC n i Baku och i Moskva. Oroligheterna ledde till en blodig väpnad konflikt som varade fram till 1994 då ett eldupphör trädde i kraft. De armeniska styrkorna i Nagorno-Karabach (varken Armeniska SSR
2 CONC  eller republiken Armenien har officiellt varit aktivt inblandat i konflikten) lyckades säkra sin självständighet och inrättade en buffertzon runt regionen. Sedan 1994 har den så kallade Minsk-gr

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} '''Antiochus IV Epiphanes''' (play /ænˈtaɪ.əkəs ɛˈpɪfəniːz/; Greek: Ἀντίοχος Ἐπιφανής, 'God Manifest'; c. 215 BC – 164 BC) ruled the Seleucid Empire from 
2 CONC 175 BC until his death in 164 BC. He was a son of King Antiochus III the Great. His original name was Mithridates; he assumed the name Antiochus after he ascended the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notable events during the reign of Antiochus IV include his near-conquest of Egypt, which led to a confrontation that became an origin of the metaphorical phrase, "line in the sand" (see below), an
2 CONC d the rebellion of the Jewish Maccabees.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus was the first Seleucid king to use divine epithets on coins, perhaps inspired by Bactrian Hellenistic kings who had earlier done so, or else building on the ruler cult that his father Ant
2 CONC iochus the Great had codified within the Seleucid Empire. These epithets included Θεὸς Ἐπιφανής 'manifest god', and, after his defeat of Egypt, Νικηφόρος 'bringer of victory'. H
2 CONC owever, Antiochus also tried to interact with common people, by appearing in the public bath houses and applying for municipal offices, and his often eccentric behavior and capricious actions led some
2 CONC  of his contemporaries to call him Epimanes ("The Mad One"), a word play on his title Epiphanes.

2 CONT <p>Antiochus (221-193 BC) was a Seleucid prince, first-born child to the Seleucid monarchs Antiochus III the Great and Laodice III, and his father's first heir.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus was of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. In 210 BC, his father made him joint king, when Antiochus III went off to the East on his great expedition. He was partly in command of the Se
2 CONC leucid army at the victory at Panion in 200 BC. He is not recorded to have had any real independent authority, but he was appointed viceroy of the eastern Seleucid satrapies. Antiochus is named in sev
2 CONC eral decrees and letters with his father. In 200 BC, Antiochus was present at the battle of Panium and received the command over the right wing of the cavalry; it was he who routed the Egyptian cavalr
2 CONC y and attacked the Ptolemaic center from the rear with his victorious cavalry. In 196 BC, Antiochus was appointed as the heir to the Seleucid throne. In that year, his father arranged for him to marry
2 CONC  his younger sister Laodice IV. The marriage between Laodice IV and Antiochus was the first sibling marriage to occur in the Seleucid dynasty. From their sibling union, Laodice IV bore Antiochus a dau
2 CONC ghter called Nysa.

2 CONT <p>In 193 BC, Antiochus III appointed his daughter, the sister-wife of his son, Antiochus, as the chief priestess of the state cult dedicated to their late mother Laodice III in Media. Later that year

2 CONC s a ruler he was best known for his encouragement of Greek culture and institutions. His attempts to suppress Judaism brought on the Wars of the Maccabees.
2 CONT <p>Early career.</p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus was the third son of Antiochus III the Great. After his father's defeat by the Romans in 190-189, he served as hostage for his father in Rome from 189 to 175, where he learned to admire R
2 CONC oman institutions and policies. His brother, King Seleucus IV, exchanged him for Demetrius, the son of Seleucus; and after Seleucus was murdered by Heliodorus, a usurper, Antiochus in turn ousted him.
2 CONC  During this period ofuncertainty in Syria, the guardians of Ptolemy VI, the Egyptian ruler, laid claim to Coele Syria, Palestine, and Phoenicia, which Antiochus III had conquered. Both the Syrian and
2 CONC  Egyptian parties appealed toRome for help, but the Senate refused to take sides. In 173 Antiochuspaid the remainder of the war indemnity that had been imposed by the Romans on Antiochus III at the Tr
2 CONC eaty of Apamea (188).
2 CONT <p>Antiochus forestalled an Egyptian expedition to Palestine by invadingEgypt. He defeated the Egyptians between Pelusium and Mount Kasion, conquered Pelusium, and in 169 occupied Egypt with the excep
2 CONC tion of Alexandria, the capital. Ptolemy VI was Antiochus' nephew--Antiochus' sister, Cleopatra I, had married Ptolemy V--and Antiochus contented himself with ruling Egypt as Ptolemy's guardian, givin
2 CONC g Rome no excuse for intervention. The citizens of Alexandria, however, appealed to PtolemyVIII, the brother of Ptolemy VI, and to his sister Cleopatra II to form a rival government. Disturbances in P
2 CONC alestine forced Antiochus to return to Syria, but he safeguarded his access to Egypt with a strong garrison in Pelusium.
2 CONT <p>In the winter of 169/168 Perseus of Macedonia in vain begged Antiochus to join forces with him against the danger that Rome presented to all of the Hellenistic monarchs. In Egypt, Ptolemy VI made c
2 CONC ommon causewith his brother and sister and sent a renewed request to Rome for aid, and Antiochus prepared for battle. The fleet of Antiochus won a victory at Cyprus, whose governor surrendered the isl
2 CONC and to him. Antiochus invaded Egypt again in 168, demanded that Cyprus and Pelusium be ceded to him, occupied Lower Egypt, and camped outside Alexandria. The cause of the Ptolemaeans seemed lost. But 
2 CONC on June 22, 168, the Romans defeated Perseus and his Macedonians at Pydna, and there deprived Antiochus of the benefits of his victory. In Eleusis, a suburb of Alexandria, the Roman ambassador, Gaius 
2 CONC Popillius Laenas, presented Antiochus with the ultimatum that he evacuate Egypt and Cyprus immediately. Antiochus, taken by surprise, asked for time to consider. Popillius, however, drew a circle in t
2 CONC he earth around the king with his walking stick and demanded an unequivocal answer before Antiochus left the circle. Dismayed by this public humiliation, the king quickly agreed to comply. Roman inter
2 CONC vention had reestablished the status quo. By being allowed to retain southern Syria, to which Egypt had laid claim, Antiochus wasable to preserve the territorial integrity of his realm.
2 CONT <p>Efforts to hellenize the kingdom.</p>
2 CONT <p>Both economically and socially he made efforts to strengthen his kingdom--inhabited in the main by Orientals (non-Greeks of Asia Minor and Persia)--by founding and fostering Greek cities. Even befo
2 CONC re he had begun his reign he had contributed to the building of the temple of Zeusin Athens and to the adornment of the theatre. He enlarged Antioch onthe Orontes by adding a section to the city (name
2 CONC d Epiphania after him). There he built an aqueduct, a council hall, a marketplace, and a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus. Babylon, which revered him as Soter (Liberator, or Saviour) of Asia, was given a
2 CONC  Greek colony that was grantedfreedom of the city. Another Epiphania was founded in Armenia. Ecbatana (in Persia) was also named Epiphania and became a Greek city. Many of these cities were granted th
2 CONC e right to coin their own municipal currency. The mint of Antioch on the Persian Gulf served the trade along the sea route between India and the district at the mouth of the greatMesopotamian rivers.
2 CONT <p>Antiochus' hellenizing policies brought him into conflict with the prosperous Oriental temple organizations, and particularly with the Jews. Since Antiochus III's reign the Jews had enjoyed extensi
2 CONC ve autonomyunder their high priest. They were divided into two parties, the orthodox Hasideans (Pious Ones) and a reform party that favoured Hellenism. For financial reasons Antiochus supported the re
2 CONC form party and, in return for a considerable sum, permitted the high priest, Jason, to build a gymnasium in Jerusalem and to introduce the Greek mode of educating young people. In 172, for an even big
2 CONC ger tribute, he appointed Menelaus in place of Jason. In 169, however, while Antiochus was campaigning in Egypt, Jason conquered Jerusalem--with the exception of the citadel--and murdered many adheren
2 CONC ts of his rival Menelaus. When Antiochus returned from Egypt in 167 he took Jerusalem by storm and enforced its Hellenization. The city forfeited its privileges and was permanently garrisoned by Syria
2 CONC n soldiers.
2 CONT <p>The revolt of Judas Maccabeus.</p>
2 CONT <p>The Greeks and those friendly toward them were united into the community of Antiochians; the worship of Yahweh and all of the Jewish rites were forbidden on pain of death. In the Temple an altar to
2 CONC  Zeus Olympios was erected, and sacrifices were to be made at the feet of an idol in the image of the King. Against that desecration Judas Maccabeus, leader of the anti-Greek Jews, led the aroused Has
2 CONC ideans in a guerrilla war and several times defeated the generals Antiochus had commissionedto deal with the uprising. Judas refused a partial amnesty, conqueredJudaea with the exception of the Acra i
2 CONC n Jerusalem, and in December 164 was able to tear down the altar of Zeus and reconsecrate the Temple. Antiochus apparently had underestimated the strength of the Hasidean movement, which was behind th
2 CONC e success in maintaining an independent Judaean state for about a century. The fighting spirit of the Jews was all the more impressive because at the beginning of their rebellion in 166 Antiochus had 
2 CONC just demonstrated his might to the world at Daphne, near Antioch, with a grand review of his army: 46,000 foot soldiers were on parade, among them a Macedonian phalanx of 20,000 men and 500 mercenarie
2 CONC s equipped with Roman arms, followed by 8,500 horsemen and 306 armoured elephants.
2 CONT <p>Antiochus then mounted a campaign against the Parthians who were threatening the empire in the east, recovered the income from that area, forced Artaxias of Armenia--who had defected--to recognize 
2 CONC his suzerainty, founded the city of Antioch on the Persian Gulf, set out on an expedition to the Arabian coast, and, at the end of 164, died of an illness at Tabae (or Gabae, probably present Isfahan)
2 CONC  in Persis. Many believers saw his death as a punishment for his attempt to loot the shrine of Nanaia in Elam (in modern Iran).

2 CONT <p>Antiochus' hellenizing policies brought him into conflict with the prosperous Oriental temple organizations, and particularly with the Jews. Since Antiochus III's reign the Jews had enjoyed extensi

2 CONC ger tribute, he appointed Menelaus in place of Jason. In 169, however, while Antiochus was campaigning in Egypt, Jason conquered Jerusalem--with the exception of the citadel--and murdered many adheren

2 CONT <p>The revolt of Judas Maccabeus.</p>
2 CONT <p>The Greeks and those friendly toward them were united into the community of Antiochians; the worship of Yahweh and all of the Jewish rites were forbidden on pain of death. In the Temple an altar to

2 CONC n Jerusalem, and in December 164 was able to tear down the altar of Zeus and reconsecrate the Temple. Antiochus apparently had underestimated the strength of the Hasidean movement, which was behind th
2 CONC e success in maintaining an independent Judaean state for about a century. The fighting spirit of the Jews was all the more impressive because at the beginning of their rebellion in 166 Antiochus had 
2 CONC just demonstrated his might to the world at Daphne, near Antioch, with a grand review of his army: 46,000 foot soldiers were on parade, among them a Macedonian phalanx of 20,000 men and 500 mercenarie

2 CONC s a ruler he was best known for his encouragement of Greek culture and institutions. His attempts to suppress Judaism brought on the Wars of the Maccabees.
2 CONT <p>Early career.</p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus was the third son of Antiochus III the Great. After his father's defeat by the Romans in 190-189, he served as hostage for his father in Rome from 189 to 175, where he learned to admire R
2 CONC oman institutions and policies. His brother, King Seleucus IV, exchanged him for Demetrius, the son of Seleucus; and after Seleucus was murdered by Heliodorus, a usurper, Antiochus in turn ousted him.
2 CONC  During this period ofuncertainty in Syria, the guardians of Ptolemy VI, the Egyptian ruler, laid claim to Coele Syria, Palestine, and Phoenicia, which Antiochus III had conquered. Both the Syrian and
2 CONC  Egyptian parties appealed toRome for help, but the Senate refused to take sides. In 173 Antiochuspaid the remainder of the war indemnity that had been imposed by the Romans on Antiochus III at the Tr
2 CONC eaty of Apamea (188).
2 CONT <p>Antiochus forestalled an Egyptian expedition to Palestine by invadingEgypt. He defeated the Egyptians between Pelusium and Mount Kasion, conquered Pelusium, and in 169 occupied Egypt with the excep
2 CONC tion of Alexandria, the capital. Ptolemy VI was Antiochus' nephew--Antiochus' sister, Cleopatra I, had married Ptolemy V--and Antiochus contented himself with ruling Egypt as Ptolemy's guardian, givin
2 CONC g Rome no excuse for intervention. The citizens of Alexandria, however, appealed to PtolemyVIII, the brother of Ptolemy VI, and to his sister Cleopatra II to form a rival government. Disturbances in P
2 CONC alestine forced Antiochus to return to Syria, but he safeguarded his access to Egypt with a strong garrison in Pelusium.
2 CONT <p>In the winter of 169/168 Perseus of Macedonia in vain begged Antiochus to join forces with him against the danger that Rome presented to all of the Hellenistic monarchs. In Egypt, Ptolemy VI made c
2 CONC ommon causewith his brother and sister and sent a renewed request to Rome for aid, and Antiochus prepared for battle. The fleet of Antiochus won a victory at Cyprus, whose governor surrendered the isl
2 CONC and to him. Antiochus invaded Egypt again in 168, demanded that Cyprus and Pelusium be ceded to him, occupied Lower Egypt, and camped outside Alexandria. The cause of the Ptolemaeans seemed lost. But 
2 CONC on June 22, 168, the Romans defeated Perseus and his Macedonians at Pydna, and there deprived Antiochus of the benefits of his victory. In Eleusis, a suburb of Alexandria, the Roman ambassador, Gaius 
2 CONC Popillius Laenas, presented Antiochus with the ultimatum that he evacuate Egypt and Cyprus immediately. Antiochus, taken by surprise, asked for time to consider. Popillius, however, drew a circle in t
2 CONC he earth around the king with his walking stick and demanded an unequivocal answer before Antiochus left the circle. Dismayed by this public humiliation, the king quickly agreed to comply. Roman inter
2 CONC vention had reestablished the status quo. By being allowed to retain southern Syria, to which Egypt had laid claim, Antiochus wasable to preserve the territorial integrity of his realm.
2 CONT <p>Efforts to hellenize the kingdom.</p>
2 CONT <p>Both economically and socially he made efforts to strengthen his kingdom--inhabited in the main by Orientals (non-Greeks of Asia Minor and Persia)--by founding and fostering Greek cities. Even befo
2 CONC re he had begun his reign he had contributed to the building of the temple of Zeusin Athens and to the adornment of the theatre. He enlarged Antioch onthe Orontes by adding a section to the city (name
2 CONC d Epiphania after him). There he built an aqueduct, a council hall, a marketplace, and a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus. Babylon, which revered him as Soter (Liberator, or Saviour) of Asia, was given a
2 CONC  Greek colony that was grantedfreedom of the city. Another Epiphania was founded in Armenia. Ecbatana (in Persia) was also named Epiphania and became a Greek city. Many of these cities were granted th
2 CONC e right to coin their own municipal currency. The mint of Antioch on the Persian Gulf served the trade along the sea route between India and the district at the mouth of the greatMesopotamian rivers.

2 CONT <p>Antiochus IV Epiphanes</p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus IV Epiphanes (??t????? ?p?fa???, Greek: Manifest) ("The Shining One") (c. 215–163 BC, reigned 175–163 BC) was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. He was originally named Mithr
2 CONC adates, but renamed Antiochus, either upon his ascension, or after the death of his elder brother Antiochus. Epiphanies was simply a common epithet that many leaders used meaning divine, some people r
2 CONC eferred to him as Epimanes meaning madman. He was a son of Antiochus III the Great and brother of Seleucus IV Philopator.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus took power after the death of Seleucus Philopator. He had been hostage in Rome following the peace of Apamea in 188 BC, but had recently been exchanged for the son and rightful heir of Se
2 CONC leucus IV, the later Demetrius I Soter. Antiochus took advantage of this situation, and proclaimed himself co-regent with another of Seleucus' sons, the infant Antiochus, whose murder he orchestrated 
2 CONC a few years later.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notable events during his reign include the near-conquest of Egypt, which was halted by the threat of Roman intervention, and the beginning of the Jewish revolt of the Maccabees.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Because the guardians of Ptolemy VI of Egypt were demanding the return of Coele-Syria, Antiochus, in 170 BC, decided on a preemptive strike against Egypt, and invaded, conquering all but Alexandria
2 CONC . He then captured Ptolemy, and agreed to let him continue as King, but as his puppet. (This had the advantage of not alarming Rome.) Alexandria thereupon chose Ptolemy's brother Ptolemy Euergetes as 
2 CONC King. In Antiochus' absence, the two brothers agreed to rule jointly. Hence, in 168 BC, Antiochus again invaded, and overran all Egypt, except for Alexandria, while his fleet captured Cyprus. Near Ale
2 CONC xandria he was met by Gaius Popillius Laenas, who told him that he must immediately withdraw from Egypt and Cyprus. Antiochus said he would discuss it with his council, whereupon the envoy drew a line
2 CONC  round him in the sand, and said, "Think about it here." The implication was that, were he to step out of the circle without having first undertaken to withdraw, he would be at war with Rome. Antiochu
2 CONC s agreed to withdraw.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In a spirit of revenge, he organized an expedition against Jerusalem, which he destroyed; he put many of its inhabitants to death most cruelly. From this time, the Jews began the war of independenc
2 CONC e under their Maccabean leaders, defeating the armies that Antiochus sent against them. Enraged at this, Antiochus is said to have marched against them in person, threatening to exterminate the nation
2 CONC ; but, on the way, he was suddenly arrested by the hand of death (164 BC). The exact causes of the Jewish revolt, and of Antiochus' response to it, are uncertain; the Jewish accounts are in the Books 
2 CONC of Maccabees, and the successful revolt is commemorated by the holiday of Hanukkah. His last years were spent on a campaign against the rising Parthian empire, which seems to have been initially succe
2 CONC ssful, but which terminated upon his death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The reign of Antiochus was a last period of strength for the empire, but in some way it was fatal; since he was an usurper, and left his infant son Antiochus V Eupator as his successor, devastating
2 CONC  dynastic wars followed his death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Christian theologians traditionally have pointed to the prophecy in the Book of Daniel as foretelling the coming of Antichus Epiphanes.1 2, but there is disagreement on the issue[1].

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus V Eupator (c. 173 BC - 162 BC), was a ruler of the Greek Seleucid Empire who reigned 164-162 BC. He was only nine when he succeeded to the kingship, following the death in Persia of his f
2 CONC ather Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Regent for the boy was the general Lysias who had been left in charge of Syria by Epiphanes. Lysias was however seriously challenged by other generals and was therefore i
2 CONC n a precarious situation. To make matters worse, the Roman senate kept Demetrius, the son of Seleucus IV and the rightful heir to the throne, as a hostage. By threatening to release him, the senate co
2 CONC uld easily control the Seleucid government.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The attempt to check the Jewish rebellion ended in a weak compromise despite a military victory for the still very fearsome Seleucid army. A Roman embassy now travelled along the cities of Syria an
2 CONC d crippled the Seleucid military power. Warships were sunk and elephants hamstrung in accordance with the peace treaty of Apamea made in 188 BC. Lysias dared do nothing to oppose the Romans, but his s

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy III Euergetes (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Εὐεργέτης, Ptolemaĩos Euergétēs, reigned 246–222 BC) was the third king of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Euergetes ("Benefactor") was the eldest son of Ptolemy II Philadelphus and his first wife, Arsinoe I, and came to power in 246 BC upon the death of his father. He married Berenice of Cyrene in the 
2 CONC year corresponding to 244/243 BC; and their children were:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p># Arsinoe III, born in ca 246/245 BC. She later married her brother Ptolemy IV
2 CONT <p># Ptolemy IV Philopator, born ca 244 BC</p>
2 CONT <p># Possibly Lysimachus. The name of the son is not known, but he is said to have been born in ca 243 BC.
2 CONT <p># Alexander, born in c. 242 BC</p>
2 CONT <p># Magas, was born in ca 241 BC. Scalded to death in his bath by Theogos or Theodotus, at the orders of Ptolemy IV.
2 CONT <p># Berenice, probably born in ca 239 BC and died a year later.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Reign'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy III Euergetes was responsible for the first known example of a series of decrees published as bilingual inscriptions on massive stone blocks in three writing systems. His stone stela is the
2 CONC  Canopus Stone of 238 BC. Other well-known examples are the Memphis Stele (Memphis Stone), bearing the Decree of Memphis, about 218 BC, passed by his son, Ptolemy IV, as well as the famous Rosetta Sto
2 CONC ne erected by Ptolemy Epiphanes, his grandson, in 196 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy III's stone contains decrees about priestly orders, and is a memorial for his daughter Berenice. But two of its 26 lines of hieroglyphs decree the use of a leap day added to the Egyptian ca
2 CONC lendar of 365 days, and the associated changes in festivals.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He is also credited with the foundation of the Serapeum, as well as the temple of Horus at Edfu, which he commissioned in about 237 BC, although the main temple would not be finished until the reig
2 CONC n of his son, Ptolemy IV, in 231 BC, and it would not be officially opened until 142 BC, during the reign of Ptolemy VIII. Also, the reliefs on the great pylon were only completed in the reign of Ptol
2 CONC emy XII. He, like many Pharaohs before him, also added to the Temple of Karnak.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Due to a falling out at the Seleucid court, Ptolemy's eldest sister Berenice Phernophorus was murdered along with her infant son. In response Ptolemy III invaded Syria.[5] During this war, the Thir
2 CONC d Syrian War, he occupied Antioch and even reached Babylon.[6] In exchange for a peace in 241 BC, Ptolemy was awarded new territories on the northern coast of Syria, including Seleucia Pieria, the por
2 CONC t of Antioch. From this capture he received fifteen hundred talents of silver, roughly a tenth of his annual income. During his involvement in the Third Syrian War, he managed to regain many Egyptian 
2 CONC works of art that had been stolen when the Persians conquered Egypt. While he was away fighting, he left his wife, Berenice II, in charge of the country, but swiftly returned when trouble erupted ther
2 CONC e. The Ptolemaic kingdom reached the height of its power during this reign.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Third Syrian War is cryptically alluded to in Daniel 11:7-9.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He maintained his father's foreign policy of subduing Macedonia by supporting its enemies. Ptolemy backed the Achaean League, a collaboration of Greek city-states, and enemies of Macedonia, but swi
2 CONC tched his support to Sparta when it came into conflict with the Achaean League and proved itself more apt to fighting the Macedonians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He continued his predecessors' work on Alexandria, especially in the Great Library. He had every book unloaded in the Alexandria docks seized, had copies made of each one, and gave the copies to th
2 CONC e previous owners while the original copies were kept in the Library. It is said that he borrowed works of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides from Athens, but deciding to forfeit the considerable depo
2 CONC sit he paid for them, he didn't give them back, and instead kept them for the Alexandrian Library.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was even more liberal towards Egyptian religion than his predecessors. He supported, promoted, and contributed towards various cults, particularly those of the Apis and Mnevis Bulls, as is state
2 CONC d in the Canopus Decree of 238 BC, in which the Egyptian priesthood praise him and his wife as "Benefactor Gods" for this religious support, as well as for maintaining peace by strong national securit

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy III Euergetes, (Greek:?t??eµa??? ??e???t??, reigned 246 BC–222 BC) is sometimes called Ptolemy III Euergetes I. The third ruler of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt, he was the eldest son o
2 CONC f Ptolemy II Philadelphus and his first wife Arsinoe I. He came to power in 246 BC upon the death of his father. He is most noted for his invasions of the northern kingdom of Syria which he commenced 
2 CONC upon the murder of his eldest sister Berenice Phernophorus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He married Berenice of Cyrene in the year corresponding to 244/243 BC; and they were parents of Arsinoe III and Ptolemy IV Philopator.

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy III Euergetes had put up the first of the Rosetta Stone series, the bilingual inscriptions on massive stone blocks in three writing systems. Ptolemy III's stone stela is the Canopus Stone o

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy III's stone contains decrees about priestly orders, and is a memorial for his daughter Berenice. But two of its 26 lines of hieroglyphs decree the use of a leap day added to the Egyptian ca

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Berenice II (267 or 266 BC-221 BC) was the daughter of Magas of Cyrene and Queen Apama II, and the wife of Ptolemy III Euergetes, the third ruler of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In about 249 BC, she was married to Demetrius the Fair, a Macedonian prince, soon after her father died. However, after coming to Cyrene he became the lover of her mother Apama. In a dramatic event
2 CONC , she had him killed in Apama's bedroom, but Apama lived on afterwards. She had no children with Demetrius.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Afterwards she married Ptolemy III. Their children were: Ptolemy IV Philopator, Magas, Lysimachus, Alexander, Arsinoe III and Berenice.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Berenice is said to have participated in the Nemean Games (between 245 and 241 BC) and to have competed in Olympic games at some unknown date.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Soon after her husband's death (221 BC) she was murdered at the instigation of her son Ptolemy IV, with whom she was probably associated in the government.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nevertheless, a decree “issued delineating the cult for the newly deified queen Berenike II…specified that men and women singers were to sing all day in front of the statue of Berenike.”

2 CONT <p>During her husband's absence on an expedition to Syria, she dedicated her hair to Aphrodite for his safe return, and placed it in the temple of the goddess at Zephyrium. The hair having by some unk
2 CONC nown means disappeared, Conon of Samos explained the phenomenon in courtly phrase, by saying that it had been carried to the heavens and placed among the stars. The name Coma Berenices or Berenice's h
2 CONC air, applied to a constellation, commemorates this incident. Callimachus celebrated the transformation in a poem, of which only a few lines remain, but there is a fine translation of it by Catullus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The city of Euesperides was refounded by her and received her name, Berenice (near the location of Benghazi). The asteroid 653 Berenike, discovered in 1907, is also named after Queen Berenice.

2 CONT <p>Mithridates II (in Greek M????d?t??; lived 3rd century BC), third king of Pontus and son of Ariobarzanes, whom he succeeded on the throne. He was a minor when his father died, but the period of his
2 CONC  accession cannot be deter­mined. It seems probable that it must be placed considerably before 240 BC, as Memnon tells us that he was a child at his father's death, and he had a daughter of marriagea
2 CONC ble age in 222 BC. Shortly after his accession, his kingdom was invaded by the Gauls, who were eventually repulsed.1 After he attained manhood, he married Laodice, a sister of Seleucus II Callinicus, 
2 CONC with whom he is said to have received the province of Phrygia as a dowry.2 But notwithstanding this alliance, we find Mithridates II fighting against Seleucus during a war between Seleucus and Antioch
2 CONC us Hierax. Eventually, Mithridates defeated Seleucus in a great battle whereby Seleucus lost twenty thousand of his troops and narrowly escaped with his own life.3 In 222 BC, Mithridates gave his daug
2 CONC hter Laodice in marriage to the Seleucid king Antiochus III: another of his daughters, also named Laodice, was married about the same time to Achaeus, the cousin of Antiochus.4 In 220 BC, Mithridates 
2 CONC declared war upon the wealthy and powerful city of Sinope. However, he was unable to weaken it and the city did not fall into the power of the kings of Pontus until 183 BC.5 At an earlier period, we f

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice (flourished 3rd century BC) was a Greek Princess of the Seleucid Empire. Laodice was of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. She was one of the daughters and youngest child born to the Sel
2 CONC eucid Monarchs Antiochus II Theos and Laodice I. Among her siblings were her brothers Seleucus II Callinicus and Antiochus Hierax. Laodice was born and raised in the Seleucid Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anywhere from 245 BC to 239 BC, her mother and Seleucus II arranged for her to marry King Mithridates II of Pontus. Laodice married Mithridates II, as a part of a political alliance between the Sel
2 CONC eucid Empire and the Kingdom of Pontus. In 245 BC, her mother and Seleucus II were in the Third Syrian War Third Syrian War. To gain support from the Kingdom of Pontus, Laodice was given to Mithridate
2 CONC s II in marriage and as a marriage gift, Phrygia was transferred as well.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Through her marriage Laodice became Queen of Pontus. Mithridates’ marriage to Laodice was one of the most important features in his reign and was an ambitious marriage policy he initiated. Throug
2 CONC h his political alliance and marriage to Laodice, Mithridates II allied himself to the most important royal house in Asia and gaining impressive recognition for Pontus as a political power in the Hell
2 CONC enistic world. This marriage also strengthened the pro-Seleucid orientation in foreign policy of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The marriage occurred early in the reign of Seleucus II Callinicus, so he could secure Anatolia behind him, so that Seleucus II could turn his attention to war with the Egyptian Greek Pharaoh Ptole
2 CONC my III Euergetes. At some point, Laodice may have influenced Mithridates II by her desire to weaken the Seleucid state, by supporting her first brother Seleucus II Callinicus in joint rule with her ot
2 CONC her brother Antiochus Hierax, who were at civil war with each other. Laodice bore Mithridates II three children, two daughters: Laodice III, Laodice of Pontus and a son Mithridates III of Pontus.

2 CONC tiske Selevkideriket og styrte fra 246 f.Kr. til 225 f.Kr.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det er uklart når han ble født, muligens en gang rundt 265 f.Kr. Etter at hans far Antiokos II Theos var død, ble Selevkos utropt som konge av sin mor Laodike I i Efesos. Hun hadde samtidig latt
2 CONC  sine egne folk i byen Antiokia ved Orontes drepe Antikos' andre hustru Berenike og hennes lille sønn. Berenikes bror var kong Ptolemaios III Euergetes av Egypt. I raseri over søsterens død, erklæ
2 CONC rte han krig og invaderte Selevkideriket. Hans mistanker om dødsårsaken for søsteren og nevøen var ikke grunnløse og var en hovedårsak for den tredje syriske krig, også kalt for den leodikiske 
2 CONC krig. Han marsjerte seierrik helt til Tigris, og kanskje videre også. Selevkiderikets østlige provinser underkastet samtidig som den egyptiske flåten sveipte langs kysten av Anatolia. Han fikk tatt
2 CONC  Laodike I tatt til fange og henrettet henne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos II Kallinikos holdt seg i trygt i innlandet av Anatolia, og da Ptolemaios III til sist vendte tilbake til Egypt, dro Selevkos ned i Syria og gjenopprettet kontrollen over de nordlige og ø
2 CONC stlige provinsene. Imidlertid etablerte hans yngre bror Antiokos Hieraks seg som en rival til tronen i Anatolia med den fraksjonen som tilhørte moren Laodike.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ved Ankyra en gang rundt 235 f.Kr. gikk Selevkos på et knusende militært nederlag og etterlot landet bortenfor Taurusfjellene til sin bror og andre statsmakter i Anatolia. Selevkos forsøkte dere
2 CONC tter å erobre Partia, men maktet ikke å oppnå noe som helst. I henhold til en del kilder ble han selv tatt til fange og holdt i fangenskap i flere år av den partiske kongen, men det kan være en s
2 CONC ammenblanding med en senere historisk konge. Andre kilder nevner at han etablerte en fredsavtale med Arsakes I av Partia som anerkjente (i navnet) hans overherredømme.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I Anatolia blomstret den greske byen Pergamon ved kysten av Egeerhavet og ble en betydelig maktfaktor under Attalos. Antiokos Hieraks forsøkte, uten lykkes, å ta sin brors besittelser da hans egn
2 CONC e forsvant hen, og endte opp som en flyktning i Trakia i 228 eller 227 f.Kr. Rundt et år senere ble Selevkos drept da han ramlet av hesten.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos II Kallinikos hadde giftet seg med sin kusine Laodike II, datter av Andromakos. Selevkos fikk fem barn med henne, to døtre og tre sønnene, og av disse var blant annet Selevkos III Keraun
2 CONC os og Antiokos III den store. Han ble etterfulgt av sin eldste sønn Selevkos III, og deretter av sin yngre sønn, Antiokos III. Hans ene datter, nevnt som Antiokis, ble gift med Xerxes av Armenia, me
2 CONC ns navnene på de to andre barna er uklare.

2 CONT <p>Seleucus II Callinicus Pogon (Greek: Σέλευκος Β΄ ὁ Καλλίνικος ὁ Πώγων; the first epithet means "gloriously triumphant"; the second, which is a nickname, means "the Bear
2 CONC d"), was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, who reigned from 246 to 225 BC. After the death of his father, Antiochus, he was proclaimed king by his mother, Laodice in Ephesos, while her parti
2 CONC sans at Antioch murdered Berenice and her son, another Antiochus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This dynastic feud began the Third Syrian War. Ptolemy III, who was Berenice's brother and the ruler of Egypt, invaded the Seleucid Empire and marched victoriously to the Tigris or beyond. He recei
2 CONC ved the submission of the Seleucid Empire's eastern provinces, while Egyptian fleets swept the coast of Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus managed to maintain himself in the interior of Asia Minor. When Ptolemy returned to Egypt, Seleucus recovered Northern Syria and the nearer provinces of Iran. However, Antiochus Hierax, a 
2 CONC younger brother of Seleucus, was set up as a rival in Asia Minor against Seleucus by a party to which Laodice herself adhered.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the Battle of Ancyra (about 235 BC) Seleucus sustained a crushing defeat and left the country beyond the Taurus to his brother and the other powers of the peninsula. Seleucus then undertook an a
2 CONC nabasis to regain Parthia, the results of which came to nothing. According to some sources, he was even taken prisoner for several years by the Parthian king. Other sources mention that he established
2 CONC  a peace with Arsaces I, who recognized his sovereignty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Asia Minor, Pergamon now rose to greatness under Attalus I. Antiochus Hierax, after a failed attempt to seize his brother's dominions when his own were vanishing, perished as a fugitive in Thrac
2 CONC e in 228 or 227 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>About a year later, Seleucus was killed by a fall from his horse. Seleucus II married his cousin Laodice II, by whom he had five children and among them were: Antiochis, Seleucus III Ceraunus and A
2 CONC ntiochus III the Great. He was succeeded by his elder son, Seleucus III Ceraunus, and later by his younger son Antiochus III the Great.

2 CONT <p>Landet blev ortodoxt kristet år 301 e.Kr. och en del av den orientaliskt ortodoxa kyrkan. Armenien var det första landet som antog kristendomen som officiell religion. Som Armeniens apostel och g

2 CONT <p>Den 24 april 1915 inleddes det i dåvarande Osmanska riket ett folkmord på armenierna. Detta innebar att mellan 1 - 2 miljoner armenier och andra kristna dödades eller deporterades, och att ytter

2 CONT <p>Armenien förklarade sig självständigt den 23 augusti 1990 efter Sovjetunionens kollaps och tog då avstånd från kommunismen; landet erkändes 21 september 1991. 1988, tre år innan Sovjetunion
2 CONC ens kollaps, krävde den högsta sovjeten Nagorno-Karabach att denna autonoma enklav skulle brytas ut ur sovjetrepubliken Azerbajdzan och anslutas till Armeniska SSR. Beslutet avslogs både av sovjete
2 CONC n i Baku och i Moskva. Oroligheterna ledde till en blodig väpnad konflikt som varade fram till 1994 då ett eldupphör trädde i kraft. De armeniska styrkorna i Nagorno-Karabach (varken Armeniska SSR
2 CONC  eller republiken Armenien har officiellt varit aktivt inblandat i konflikten) lyckades säkra sin självständighet och inrättade en buffertzon runt regionen. Sedan 1994 har den så kallade Minsk-gr

2 CONT <p>=Laodice (wife of Mithridates II of Pontus)</p>
2 CONT <p>'''Laodice''' (flourished 3rd century BC) was a Greek Princess of the Seleucid Empire. Laodice was of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent.
2 CONT <p>*She was one of the daughters and youngest child born to the Seleucid Monarchs '''Antiochus II Theos''' and '''Laodice I'''.[1]
2 CONT <p>*Among her siblings were her brothers '''Seleucus II Callinicus''' and '''Antiochus Hierax'''.
2 CONT <p>*Laodice was born and raised in the Seleucid Empire.</p>
2 CONT <p>*Anywhere from 245 BC to 239 BC, her mother and Seleucus II arranged for her to marry King Mithridates II of Pontus.[2][3] Laodice married Mithridates II, as a part of a political alliance between 
2 CONC the Seleucid Empire and the Kingdom of Pontus. In 245 BC, her mother and Seleucus II were in the Third Syrian War. To gain support from the Kingdom of Pontus, Laodice was given to Mithridates II in ma
2 CONC rriage and as a marriage gift, Phrygia was transferred as well.[4]
2 CONT <p>*Through her marriage Laodice became Queen of Pontus. Mithridates’ marriage to Laodice was one of the most important features in his reign and was an ambitious marriage policy he initiated.[5] Th
2 CONC rough his political alliance and marriage to Laodice, Mithridates II allied himself to the most important royal house in Asia and gaining impressive recognition for Pontus as a political power in the 
2 CONC Hellenistic world.[6] This marriage also strengthened the pro-Seleucid orientation in foreign policy of Pontus.[7]
2 CONT <p>*The marriage occurred early in the reign of '''Seleucus II Callinicus''', so he could secure Anatolia behind him, so that Seleucus II could turn his attention to war with the Egyptian Greek Pharao
2 CONC h Ptolemy III Euergetes.[8]
2 CONT <p>*At some point, Laodice may have influenced '''Mithridates II''' by her desire to weaken the Seleucid state, by supporting her first brother '''Seleucus II Callinicus''' in joint rule with her othe
2 CONC r brother '''Antiochus Hierax''', who were at civil war with each other.[9]
2 CONT <p>*Laodice bore '''Mithridates II''' three children, two daughters:</p>
2 CONT <p># '''Laodice III''',</p>
2 CONT <p># '''Laodice of Pontus''' and a son</p>

2 CONT <p>Laodice (flourished between second half 3rd century BC and first half 2nd century BC) was a Greek Princess from the Seleucid Empire and the wife of the King Mithridates III of Pontus. Laodice appea
2 CONC rs to have come from obscure origins. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who ap
2 CONC peared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates III. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this ma
2 CONC rriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV [4] and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter call
2 CONC ed Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice and Laodice VI. Laodice bore Mithridates III three children: Mithridate
2 CONC s IV of Pontus,[7] Pharnaces I of Pontus [8] and Laodice.

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Arsinoe I (Greek: Αρσινόη Α’, 305 BC-after c. 248 BC was a Greek Princess who was of Macedonian and Thessalian descent. She was the second daughter and youngest child born to King Lysimac
2 CONC hus from his first wife, Nicaea of Macedon. Arsinoe I had two older siblings: a brother called Agathocles and a sister called Eurydice.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Her paternal grandfather was Agathocles of Pella a nobleman who was a contemporary to King Philip II of Macedon who reigned 359-336 BC, while her maternal grandfather was the powerful Regent Antipa
2 CONC ter. Arsinoe I was named in honor of an unnamed grandmother, who may have been the mother of Lysimachus or the mother of Nicaea whose both names of these women are unknown. Little is known of her life
2 CONC  prior to her marriage.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Between 289/28 and 281 BC, Arsinoe became the first wife of Ptolemaic Greek Egyptian Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who was also her distant maternal cousin. Arsinoe I married Ptolemy II as part 
2 CONC of an alliance between her father and Ptolemy II, against Seleucus I Nicator.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Arsinoe I was, by marriage, Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Arsinoe I bore Ptolemy II three children; two sons: Ptolemy III Euergetes, Lysimachus of Egypt and a daughter called Berenice. At an unkn
2 CONC own date between after 279-274/3 BC, a sister of Ptolemy II called Arsinoe II arrived in Egypt, who was the last wife of Lysimachus and had fled from her half-brother-husband Ptolemy Keraunos. Probabl
2 CONC y at the instigation of Arsinoe II, charges of conspiring to assassinate Ptolemy II were soon brought against Arsinoe I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy II had convicted Arsinoe I of plotting against him. He ended his marriage to Arsinoe I and divorced her. Ptolemy II had exiled Arsinoe I to Coptos in southern Egypt. It is chronologically p
2 CONC lausible that these events were also connected to the banishment of Ptolemy II’s niece, Theoxena of Egypt as Theoxena was sent to the Thebaid, perhaps to Coptos. Afterwards Ptolemy II married his si
2 CONC ster Arsinoe II and after the death of Arsinoe II, Ptolemy II’s children with Arsinoe I were officially regarded as the children of Arsinoe II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Arsinoe I lived in exile for twenty years. During her exile, Arsinoe I lived in great splendour and exercised considerable power, since she was a wife of a former pharaoh. Her first son with Ptolem
2 CONC y II succeeded his father after his death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A surviving Stele has been found at Coptos which refers to Arsinoe I. The Stele is of Senu-sher, a steward of Arsinoe I and the Stele is assigned to Arsinoe I’s exile. The stele calls Arsinoe I t
2 CONC he ‘king’s wife’, but her name is not enclosed in the royal Cartouche, as it is customary for an Egyptian Queen. Another piece of surviving evidence connected to Arsinoe I, is a Phoenician inscr
2 CONC iption found at Lapithos, Cyprus, which is dated in the 11th or 12th year in the reign of Ptolemy II. The inscription refers to a sacrifice instituted by Yatonba’al on behalf of ‘the legitimate sc
2 CONC ion and his wife’, hence refers to Arsinoe I. As Arsinoe I was disgraced as a traitor, the fact the person who did the sacrifice on her behalf strongly suggests that the news of her disgrace had not
2 CONC  yet reached him.

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy II Philadelphus, King of Egypt, was born circa 309 BC, died circa 246 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy II Philadelphus (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Φιλάδελφος, Ptolemaĩos Philádelphos" 309 BCE–246 BCE), was the king of Ptolemaic Egypt from 283 BCE to 246 BCE. He was the son of
2 CONC  the founder of the Ptolemaic kingdom Ptolemy I Soter and Berenice, and was educated by Philitas of Cos. He had two half-brothers, Ptolemy Keraunos and Meleager, both of whom became kings of Macedonia
2 CONC  (in 281 BCE and 279 BCE respectively). Both died in the Gallic invasion of 280-279 BCE (see Brennus).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As did the Ptolemies III through V, Ptolemy II erected a commemmorative stele, the Great Mendes Stela.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Reign</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He began his reign as co-regent with his father Ptolemy I from ca. 290 BCE–ca. 283 BCE, and maintained a splendid court in Alexandria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Egypt was involved in several wars during his reign. Magas of Cyrene opened war on his half-brother (274 BCE), and the Seleucid king Antiochus I Soter, desiring Coele-Syria with Judea, attacked soo
2 CONC n after in the First Syrian War. Two or three years of war followed. Egypt's victories solidified the kingdom's position as the undisputed naval power of the eastern Mediterranean; his fleet (112 ship
2 CONC s) bore the most powerful naval siege units of all time, guaranteed the king access to the coastal cities of his empire. The Ptolemaic sphere of power extended over the Cyclades to Samothrace, and the
2 CONC  harbours and coast towns of Cilicia Trachea, Pamphylia, Lycia and Caria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The victory won by Antigonus II Gonatas, king of Macedonia, over the Egyptian fleet at Cos (between 258 BCE and 256 BCE) did not long interrupt Ptolemy's command of the Aegean Sea. In a Second Syri
2 CONC an War with the Seleucid kingdom, under Antiochus II Theos (after 260 BCE), Ptolemy sustained losses on the seaboard of Asia Minor and agreed to a peace by which Antiochus married his daughter Berenic
2 CONC e (c. 250 BCE).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Family</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy's first wife, Arsinoë I, daughter of Lysimachus, was the mother of his legitimate children:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy III Euergetes, his successor.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Berenice Phernopherus, married Antiochus II Theos, king of Syria.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After her repudiation he married his full sister Arsinoë II, the widow of Lysimachus—an Egyptian custom—which brought him her Aegean possessions.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy had several concubines. With a woman named Bilistiche he had an (illegitimate) son named Ptolemy Andromachou [2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Other mistresses include: Agathoclea (?), Aglais (?) daughter of Megacles, the cupbearer Cleino, Didyme, the Chian harp player Glauce, the flautist Mnesis, the actress Myrtion, the flautist Pothine
2 CONC  and Stratonice. [3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Court</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The material and literary splendour of the Alexandrian court was at its height under Ptolemy II. Pomp and splendor flourished. Ptolemy deified his parents and his sister-wife, after her death (270 
2 CONC BCE). Ptolemy staged a procession in Alexandria in honor of Dionysus led by 24 chariots drawn by elephants and a procession of lions, leopards, panthers, camels, antelopes, wild asses, ostriches, a be
2 CONC ar, a giraffe and a rhinoceros. According to scholars, most of the animals were in pairs - as many as eight pairs of ostriches - and although the ordinary chariots were likely led by a single elephant
2 CONC , others which carried a 7-foot-tall (2.1 m) golden statue may have been led by four.[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Callimachus, keeper of the library, Theocritus,[5] and a host of lesser poets, glorified the Ptolemaic family. Ptolemy himself was eager to increase the library and to patronize scientific research
2 CONC . He had exotic animals of far off lands sent to Alexandria. Although an enthusiast for Hellenic culture, he also adopted Egyptian religious concepts, which helped to bolster his image as a sovereign.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The tradition preserved in the pseudepigraphical Letter of Aristeas which connects the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament into Greek with his patronage is probably overdrawn. However, Walt
2 CONC er Kaiser says, "There can be little doubt that the Law was translated in Philadelphus's time since Greek quotations from Genesis and Exodus appear in Greek literature before 200 B.C. The language of 
2 CONC the Septuagint is more like Egyptian Greek than it is like Jerusalemite Greek, according to some." [6] Ptolemy had many brilliant mistresses, and his court, magnificent and dissolute, intellectual and
2 CONC  artificial, has been compared with the Versailles of Louis XIV.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy was of a delicate constitution. Elias Joseph Bickermann (Chronology of the Ancient World, 2nd ed. 1980) gives the date of his death as January 29.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Relations with India</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy is recorded by Pliny the Elder as having sent an ambassador named Dionysius to the Mauryan court at Pataliputra in India, probably to Emperor Ashoka:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"But [India] has been treated of by several other Greek writers who resided at the courts of Indian kings, such, for instance, as Megasthenes, and by Dionysius, who was sent thither by Philadelphus
2 CONC , expressly for the purpose: all of whom have enlarged upon the power and vast resources of these nations." Pliny the Elder, "The Natural History", Chap. 21 [7]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He is also mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka as a recipient of the Buddhist proselytism of Ashoka, although no Western historical record of this event remain.

2 CONT <p>=Ptolemy Keraunos=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy Keraunos (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Κεραυνός, died 279 BC) was the King of Macedon from 281 BC to 279 BC. His epithet Keraunos is Greek for "Thunder" or "Thunderbolt".
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Departure from Egypt'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy was the eldest son of Ptolemy I Soter, Pharaoh of Egypt, and his second wife Eurydice, daughter of the regent Antipater.[1] After Keraunos' younger half-brother, also called Ptolemy, was na
2 CONC med heir apparent and, in 282 BC, ascended to the throne as Ptolemy II, he had to leave Egypt, being a potential rival for the throne. He arrived at the court of Lysimachus, the king of Thrace, Macedo
2 CONC n, and part of Asia Minor, where his half-sister Arsinoe was queen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While Ptolemy was staying in Lysimachus's court, Arsinoe's intrigues led to the accusation of Lysimachus' first son, Agathocles, of treason and to his execution. Keraunos sided with his other siste
2 CONC r (from the same mother) Lysandra, who was Agathocles' wife, and accompanied her to the court of Seleucus in the East to solicit his aid. Seeing an opportunity to intervene for his own gain in the pol
2 CONC itics of both Lysimachan Thrace and Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucus prepared an expedition against Lysimachus shortly afterwards.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Seizes the Macedonian throne'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Lysimachus' defeat and death in the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC, against Seleucus I Nicator, Ptolemy Keraunos murdered Seleucus I in order to gain the power of his former protector. He the
2 CONC n rushed to Lysimacheia where he had himself acclaimed king by the Macedonian army. At this time he also formally relinquished his claim to the Egyptian throne. To stabilize his throne, Ptolemy asked 
2 CONC his half-sister Arsinoe, the widow of Lysimachus, to marry him. In 281 BC, he made an alliance with Pyrrhus of Epirus. His only rival, Antigonos Gonatas (Greek : Αντίγονος Γονατάς), so
2 CONC n of the ex-king of Macedon, Demetrius I Poliorcetes (Greek : Δημήτριος Πολιορκητής), was confined in the city of Demetrias, Thessaly, and so Keraunos' power extended to south Gree
2 CONC ce as well.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Arsinoe was not happy with the situation. While he was away on a campaign, she conspired against him from the capital, Cassandreia (Greek: Κασσάνδρεια), with the aid of her sons. Kerauno
2 CONC s quickly captured Cassandreia, and killed Arsinoe's two younger sons, while the eldest fled north to the kingdom of the Dardanians. Arsinoe herself fled to Egypt, where she married her own brother Pt
2 CONC olemy II and became Arsinoe II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Death'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although Ptolemy Keraunos was at the zenith of his power, he did not live long afterwards. In 279 BC, he was captured and killed during the wars against the Gauls led by Bolgius who conducted a ser
2 CONC ies of mass raids against Macedon and the rest of Greece. His death brought anarchy to the Greek states, since none of his successors were able to bring stability. This situation lasted about two year
2 CONC s, until Antigonos Gonatas defeated the Gauls in the battle near Lysimachia, Thrace, in 277 BC, After this victory he was recognized king of Macedon and his power extended eventually also to southern 
2 CONC Greece.

2 CONT <p>While a new war with the Seleucids (from 274 to 270) did not affect the basic position of the rival kingdoms, the so-called Chremonidean War (268?-261), stirred up by Ptolemy against Antigonus II G

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy II Philadelphus</p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy II Philadelphus (Greek: ?t??eµa??? F???de?f??, 309–246 BC), was the king of Ptolemaic Egypt from 281 BC to 246 BC. He was of a delicate constitution. E.J.Bickermann (Chronology of the An
2 CONC cient World, 2nd ed. 1980) gives the date of his death as January 29.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His half-brother Ptolemy Ceraunus found compensation by becoming king in Macedonia in 281 BC, and perished in the Gallic invasion of 280-79 BC (see Brennus).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He began his reign as co-regent with his father Ptolemy I from 288 BC–285 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy II maintained a splendid court in Alexandria. Not that Egypt held aloof from wars. Magas of Cyrene opened war on his half-brother (274 BC), and the Seleucid king Antiochus I Soter, desiring
2 CONC  Coele-Syria with Judea, attacked soon after. Two or three years of war followed. Egypt ended as the undisputed naval power of the eastern Mediterranean; the Ptolemaic sphere of power extended over th
2 CONC e Cyclades to Samothrace, and the harbours and coast towns of Cilicia Trachea ("Rough Cilicia"), Pamphylia, Lycia and Caria were largely in Ptolemy's hands.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The victory won by Antigonus II Gonatas, king of Macedonia, over his fleet at Cos (between 258 and 256 BC) did not long interrupt his command of the Aegean. In a second war with the Seleucid kingdo
2 CONC m, under Antiochus II Theos (after 260 BC), Ptolemy sustained losses on the seaboard of Asia Minor and agreed to a peace by which Antiochus married his daughter Berenice (ca 250 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy's first wife, Arsinoë I, daughter of Lysimachus, was the mother of his legitimate children. After her repudiation he married, probably for political reasons, his full-sister Arsinoë II, t
2 CONC he widow of Lysimachus, by an Egyptian custom abhorrent to Greek morality.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The material and literary splendour of the Alexandrian court was at its height under Ptolemy II. Pomps and gay religions flourished. Ptolemy deified his parents and his sister-wife, after her death
2 CONC  (270 BC), as Philadelphus. This surname was used in later generations to distinguish Ptolemy II himself, but properly it belongs to Arsinoë only, not to the king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Callimachus, made keeper of the library, Theocritus, and a host of lesser poets, glorified the Ptolemaic family. Ptolemy himself was eager to increase the library and to patronize scientific resear
2 CONC ch. He had the strange beasts of far off lands sent to Alexandria. But, an enthusiast for Hellenic culture, he seems to have shown but little interest in the native religion.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The tradition preserved in the pseudepigraphical Letter of Aristeas which connects the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament into Greek with his patronage is probably not historical. Ptolemy 
2 CONC had many brilliant mistresses, and his court, magnificent and dissolute, intellectual and artificial, has been justly compared with the Versailles of Louis XIV.

2 CONT <p>Magas of Cyrene (flourished 3rd century BCE, ruled 276 - 250 BCE) was a Greek Macedonian King of Cyrene (modern Libya).
2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p>=Magas of Cyrene=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Magas of Cyrene (Greek: Μάγας ὁ Κυρηναῖος; born before 317 BC-250 BC, ruled 276 BC-250 BC) was a Greek Macedonian nobleman. Through his mother’s second marriage he was a member o
2 CONC f the Ptolemaic dynasty. He became King of Cyrenaica (in modern Libya) and he managed to wrestle independence for Cyrenaica from the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family background and early life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Magas was the first-born son of the noblewoman Berenice and her first husband Philip. He had two younger sisters: Antigone and Theoxena. His father, Philip was the son of Amyntas by an unnamed moth
2 CONC er. Plutarch (Pyrrhus 4.4) implies that his father was previously married and had children, including daughters born to him. Phillip served as a military officer in the service of the Macedonian King 
2 CONC Alexander the Great and was known for commanding one division of the Phalanx in Alexander’s wars.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His mother Berenice was a noblewoman from Eordeaea. She was the daughter of local obscure nobleman Magas and noblewoman Antigone. Berenice’s mother was the niece of the powerful Regent Antipater 
2 CONC and was a distant collateral relative to the Argead dynasty.[9] He was the namesake of his maternal grandfather.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>About 318 BC, his father died of natural causes. After the death of Magas’ father, Magas’ mother took him and his siblings to Egypt where they were a part of the entourage of his mother’s sec
2 CONC ond maternal cousin Eurydice. Eurydice was then the wife of Ptolemy I Soter, the first Greek Pharaoh and founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By 317 BC, Ptolemy I fell in love with Berenice and divorced Eurydice to marry her. His mother, through her marriage to Ptolemy, was an Egyptian Queen and the Queen mother of the Ptolemaic dynasty.
2 CONC  Through his mother’s marriage to Ptolemy, Magas was a stepson to Ptolemy; he became an Egyptian Prince living in his stepfather’s court and was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. His mother bore 
2 CONC Ptolemy three children: two daughters, Arsinoe II, Philotera and the future Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Governorship and kingship of Cyrenaica'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Magas received the governorship of Cyrenaica from his mother. As a posthumous honor to his biological father, Magas when he served as a Priest of the Greek God Apollo, had dedicated an honorific in
2 CONC scription proudly naming him as the ‘the eponymous priest’ and ‘Magas son of Philip’. Following the death of his stepfather in 283 BC; Magas tried on several occasions to wrestle independence 
2 CONC for Cyrenaica until he crowned himself as King around 276 BC, during the reign of his maternal half-brother Ptolemy II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Magas then married Apama II, his third maternal cousin and one of the daughters of Seleucid King Antiochus I Soter and Stratonice of Syria. Antiochus I used his marital alliance to foment a pact to
2 CONC  invade Egypt. Apama II and Magas had a daughter called Berenice II, who was their only child. Magas opened hostilities against Ptolemy II in 274 BC, attacking Egypt from the west, as Antiochus I was 
2 CONC attacking Palestine. However, Magas had to cancel his operations due to an internal revolt of the Libyan nomad Marmaridae. In the east, Antiochus I suffered defeat against the armies of Ptolemy II. Ma
2 CONC gas at least managed to maintain the independence of Cyrenaica until his death in 250 BC. Over a year after Magas died, his daughter married Ptolemy III Euergetes, the first son of Ptolemy II. Through
2 CONC  Berenice II’s marriage to her paternal cousin, Magas’ Kingdom was reabsorbed by Ptolemaic Egypt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Relations with India'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Magas is mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka, as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor Ashoka the Great’s Buddhist proselytism. Ashoka also claims that he encouraged the development of herbal
2 CONC ism, for men and animals, in the territories of the Hellenistic Kings. The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene, from the city of Cyrene where Magas ruled in Cyrenaica, is sometimes thought to have been inf
2 CONC luenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries.

2 CONT <p>=Apama II=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Apama II, sometimes known as Apame II (Ancient Greek: Ἀπάμα, about c. 292 BC-sometime after 249 BC) was a Syrian Greek Princess of the Seleucid Empire and through marriage was a Queen of Cyre
2 CONC naica.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Apama II was of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. She was a daughter of the second Seleucid King Antiochus I Soter and Queen Stratonice of Syria. Her siblings included Stratonice of Macedon and
2 CONC  the Seleucid King Antiochus II Theos. Her paternal grandparents were the first Seleucid King Seleucus I Nicator and his wife Queen Apama I, and her maternal grandparents were Antigonid King Demetrius
2 CONC  I of Macedon and his wife Queen Phila. Apama was the namesake of her paternal grandmother and paternal aunt.[4] Apama was born and raised in the Seleucid Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Around 275 BC, Apama married her maternal third cousin the Greek King Magas of Cyrene. The maternal grandmothers of Apama and Magas were paternal first cousins. The fathers of their grandmothers we
2 CONC re brothers. Although her marriage to Magas was a dynastic one, Antiochus I arranged this marriage to occur as a part of a political alliance between him and Magas to invade Egypt. Through her marriag
2 CONC e to Magas, Apama became Queen of Cyrenaica. In Cyrenaica, there is a surviving honorific inscription dedicated to Apama, as a monarch and wife of Magas.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After 270 BC, Apama bore Magas a daughter called Berenice II, who would be their only known child. In 250 BC, Magas and Apama had betrothed Berenice II to her paternal cousin and Ptolemaic prince P
2 CONC tolemy III Euergetes. Magas and the father of Ptolemy III, were maternal half brothers.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Either in 250 BC or 249 BC, Magas had died. Apama had become a widow and a powerful Greek monarch. In order to protect Cyrenaica from the Ptolemaic dynasty, Apama summoned her maternal uncle the Gr
2 CONC eek Macedonian prince Demetrius the Fair to Cyrenaica. Apama offered Demetrius her daughter in marriage to him; in return he would become king. Demetrius agreed to his niece’s request and married he
2 CONC r daughter. When Demetrius became king, there was no opposition in his rise to the throne, and he became so ambitious it reached the point of recklessness.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sometime after Demetrius married his great niece, Apama and Demetrius became lovers. Berenice became jealous of her mother’s affair with her husband. She argued with both her mother and her husba
2 CONC nd and fatally stabbed Demetrius who died in Apama’s arms. The poem Coma Berenices by Greek poet Callimachus (lost, but known in a Latin translation or paraphrase by Catullus), apparently refers to 
2 CONC her killing of Demetrius: "Let me remind you how stout-hearted you were even as a young girl: have you forgotten the brave deed by which you gained a royal marriage?"
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Demetrius, Cyrenaica became a part of the Ptolemaic Empire. Berenice II left Cyrenaica and travelled to Egypt where she married her cousin Ptolemy III and through her marriage be
2 CONC came Queen of Egypt. Apama travelled with Berenice II to Alexandria, where eventually she settled with her daughter and her family.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Apama is sometimes known as Arsinoe. After she married Magas, there is a possibility Apama changed her name to Arsinoe, which was a more familiar Ptolemaic name. Apama was related to the Ptolemaic 
2 CONC dynasty through marriage and was a distant relative of Eurydice of Egypt and Berenice I of Egypt, who were among the various wives of Ptolemy I Soter.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Laodice I''' was the first wife, and likely the cousin, of '''Antiochus II Theos''' of the Seleucid Empire. He repudiated her and her children, when (as part of a peace treaty with Ptolemy II Ph
2 CONC iladelphus of Egypt in 250 BC) he agreed to marry '''Berenice''', Ptolemy II's daughter; and declared his eldest son by Berenice his heir.
2 CONT <p>According to Eusebius, Laodice I was a daughter of '''Achaeus''', and thereby, sister of '''Antiochis''', the mother of '''Attalus I, king of Pergamus'''. When Ptolemy died in 246 BC, Antiochus too
2 CONC k Laodice back but died immediately thereafter (she is said to have poisoned him). Berenice's son was less than four years old, and Laodice argued that her eldest son, Seleucus, had been named heir to
2 CONC  the throne by Antiochus on his deathbed. Laodice had Berenice and her son murdered, which began the Third Syrian War (also known as the Laodicean War) between the newly crowned Seleucus and Ptolemy I
2 CONC II of Egypt, Berenice's brother.
2 CONT <p>During the course of this war, Laodice attempted to take control over the Empire by insisting that Seleucus make his younger brother Antiochus Hierax co-regent and give him all Seleucid territory i

2 CONT <p>'''Family Background'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice was a woman of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. According to Eusebius of Caesarea (1.251), she was a daughter of Achaeus by an unnamed Greek mother. Her father Achaeus was a wealthy no

2 CONC was the heir to the Seleucid throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When her paternal uncle Antiochus I Soter died in 261 BC, Antiochus II succeeded his father. Through her marriage, Laodice I became a Seleucid queen. Little is known on her relationship with Antioc
2 CONC hus II. Laodice I bore her husband two sons: Seleucus II Callinicus and Antiochus Hierax, and three daughters: Apama, Stratonice of Cappadocia and Laodice.

2 CONT <p>'''Divorce with Antiochus II'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 252 BC after the Second Syrian War, Antiochus II was obliged to make peace with the Egyptian Greek Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Antiochus made peace with the Pharaoh by divorcing Laodice and

2 CONC kept as royal land in disposal in grants or sales.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In a clause in the divorce settlement, Laodice was allowed to sell or donate land in which she had the right to choose which attachment of a city were to be passed on to the new landlord, unless La
2 CONC odice had taken care of the matter herself. Antiochus gave her a grace period to settle matters on her land before she decided whether to hold on to the land or dispose it. She may have been given the
2 CONC  revenue of two harvests with which to pay a nominal purchase price to set at the valuation of the land for tax purposes. When Laodice was able to make payment, the land she intended to purchase could
2 CONC  remain part of royal land and couldn’t be made as a part of an attachment to a city. The only one who could order to reallocate or rearrange land lots was the King.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Laodice sold a land attachment, the new owner was not permitted to remove it from the city or attach it to another. As she was a former queen, as a part of a land sale she possessed everything
2 CONC  on the land that was transferred to her during the sale. She collected revenue from annual agriculture harvests and other forms from her lands. Antiochus, on one occasion, granted Laodice a complete 
2 CONC property tax exemption.

2 CONT <p>'''Deaths of Antiochus II and his second family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During Antiochus II’s marriage to Berenice, she bore him a son called Antiochus. Laodice I lived at Ephesus. On January 28 246 BC, Ptolemy II died, and was succeeded by Ptolemy III Euergetes. Aft
2 CONC er the death of Ptolemy II, Antiochus II left his second family in Antioch and returned to Laodice. He named his first son with Laodice as his successor to the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In July 246 BC, Antiochus II died (some suggest that he was poisoned by a revengeful Laodice) leaving a confusing dynastic situation. Seleucus II succeeded his father as king and his brother Antioc
2 CONC hus Hierax was named co-ruler in Sardis. They lived with Laodice at Ephesus. Laodice, either for revenge or to prevent civil war, had Berenice and her son murdered in the late summer of 246 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Out of his outrage, the brother of Berenice, Ptolemy III declared war and invaded the Seleucid Empire. His suspicions about the deaths of his sister and nephew were firmly grounded and were a part 
2 CONC of the cause of the Third Syrian War also known as the ‘Laodicean War’ or the ‘War of Laodice’. Ptolemy captured Laodice and had her killed. This happened no earlier than 236 BC because there 
2 CONC are two honorific inscriptions in Babylon dedicated to her dated to 247 BC and 237 BC. During the war, while Seleucus was fighting Ptolemy, Laodice supported the revolt of her second son against her f
2 CONC irst son. This occurred in 244 BC which caused a civil war for the next 17 years between Seleucus II and Antiochus Hierax.

2 CONT <p>Laodicea was founded in circa 260 B.C. by Antiochus II. He named the cityfor his wife, Laodice, whom he later divorced. The Romans took control ofthe city in 129 B.C. and made it a "free city." In

2 CONT <p>Her name in Greek, Laodikeia comes from two words - Lao=people and decia,dee'-kay; right (as self-evident), i.e., justice (the principle, adecision, or its execution)--judgment, punish, vengeance -

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus II Theos (Greek: Ἀντίοχος Β΄ ὁ Θεός; 286–246 BC) was a Greek king of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from 261 to 246 BC. He succeeded his father Antiochus I
2 CONC  Soter in the winter of 262–61 BC. He was the younger son of Antiochus I and princess Stratonice, the daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He inherited a state of war with Ptolemaic Egypt, the "Second Syrian War", which was fought along the coasts of Asia Minor, and the constant intrigues of petty despots and restless city-states in A
2 CONC sia Minor. Antiochus also made some attempt to get a footing in Thrace. During the war he was given the title Theos (Greek: Θεός, "God"), being such to the Milesians in slaying the tyrant Timarchu
2 CONC s.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the time Antiochus was occupied with the war against Egypt, Andragoras, his satrap in Parthia, proclaimed independence. According to Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus, in Bactria, his satr
2 CONC ap Diodotus also revolted in 255 BC, and founded the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which further expanded in India in 180 BC to form the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180–1 BC). Then about 238 BC, Arsaces led a rev
2 CONC olt of the Parthians against Andragoras, leading to the foundation of the Parthian Empire. These events would have cut off communications with India. Phylarchus relays current scandals regarding his d
2 CONC runken banquets and liaisons with unsuitable young men.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>About this time, Antiochus made peace with Ptolemy II Philadelphus, ending the Second Syrian War. Antiochus repudiated his wife Laodice I and exiled her to Ephesus. To seal the treaty, he married P
2 CONC tolemy's daughter Berenice and received an enormous dowry.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During her stay in Ephesus, Laodice I continued numerous intrigues to become queen again. By 246 BC Antiochus had left Berenice and their infant son Antiochus, in Antioch to live again with Laodice
2 CONC  I in Asia Minor. Laodice I took the occasion to poison Antiochus while her partisans at Antioch murdered Berenice and their infant son. Antiochus was buried in the Belevi Mausoleum.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice I then proclaimed Seleucus II as King. With his cousin-wife Laodice I, Antiochus had two sons: Seleucus II Callinicus, Antiochus Hierax and three daughters: Apama, Stratonice of Cappadocia 
2 CONC and Laodice.

2 CONT <p>'''Relations with India'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus is mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka, as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor Ashoka's Buddhist proselytism:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''"And even this conquest [preaching Buddhism] has been won by the Beloved of the Gods here and in all the borderlands, as far as six hundred yojanas (5,400-9,600 km) away, where Antiochos, king of
2 CONC  the Yavanas [Greeks] rules, and beyond this Antiochus four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule."''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ashoka also claims that he encouraged the development of herbal medicine, for men and animals, in the territories of the Hellenistic kings:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''"Everywhere within Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi's [Ashoka's] domain, and among the people beyond the borders, the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Satiyaputras, the Keralaputras, as far as Tamrapar
2 CONC ni and where the Greek king Antiochos rules, and among the kings who are neighbors of Antiochos, everywhere has Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, made provision for two types of medical treatment: m

2 CONT <p>=Andromachus=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Andromachus (Greek: Aνδρoμαχoς, lived 3rd century BC) was an Anatolian nobleman of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. Andromachus’ father was a wealthy nobleman who owned estates in Ana
2 CONC tolia and his family had power in Anatolia with strong royal connections. Andromachus was the second son of Achaeus by an unnamed Greek mother and a grandson of Seleucus I Nicator (the founder of the 
2 CONC Seleucid Empire) and his first wife Apama I. He had four siblings; one brother: Alexander and two sisters: Antiochis and Laodice I. He was the father of Achaeus and Laodice II. Laodice II married her 
2 CONC cousin, the Seleucid King Seleucus II Callinicus and they were the parents of Antiochus III the Great.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At some moment in the course of a war between the Seleucids and Egyptian Greek Pharaoh Ptolemy III Euergetes took him prisoner; and when Ptolemy III died in 221 BC, Andromachus was still a prisoner
2 CONC  in Egypt. Since Achaeus had long shown great anxiety to secure his son's release, Ptolemy IV of Egypt’s chief advisor Sosibius, regarded the captive grandee as a very valuable piece to play in the 
2 CONC political game. He had, perhaps, before the revolt of Achaeus, tried to strike a bargain with him-—the release of Andromachus as the price of Achaeus deserting his king. When Achaeus had once revolt
2 CONC ed, pushed by other circumstances, and without having made any compact with Egypt, there was the less reason to let Andromachus go. Sosibius was very unwilling to part with such a valuable asset; but 
2 CONC around 220 BC the Rhodians exerted themselves as intercessors on behalf of Achaeus, changing radically the situation.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Rhodians decision did not spring from altruism: it was a move with which they hoped to defeat the city-state of Byzantium, with which they were at war. Byzantium hoped to gain Achaeus' support 
2 CONC against Rhodes and its allies; by obtaining Andromachus release the Rhodians planned to foil this design and obtain Achaeus' benevolence. They therefore sent an embassy to Ptolemy IV asking him to del
2 CONC iver this Andromachus to them. This request they had made before, but without laying any great stress upon it. Now, however, they put much more insistence upon it; and while Ptolemy at first refused t
2 CONC o free Andromachus, on second thoughts, being anxious to please the Rhodians, the king yielded to their request, and handed over Andromachus to them to conduct to his son. This was done, and father an
2 CONC d son were reunited. After this occurrence, Andromachus disappears from history.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus (Greek: Λυσίμαχος, Lysimachos; c. 360 BC-281 BC) was a Macedonian officer and diadochus (i.e. "successor") of Alexander the Great, who became a basileus ("King") in 306 BC, ruli
2 CONC ng Thrace, Asia Minor and Macedon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Early life and career'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus was born in 361 BC (or 355 BC), to a family of Thessalian Greek stock. He was the second son of Agathocles and his wife; there is some indication in the historical sources that this wife
2 CONC  was perhaps named Arsinoe, and that Lysimachus' paternal grandfather may have been called Alcimachus. His father was a nobleman of high rank who was an intimate friend of Philip II of Macedon, who sh
2 CONC ared in Philip II’s councils and became a favourite in the Argead court. Lysimachus and his brothers grew up with the status of Macedonians; all these brothers enjoyed with Lysimachus prominent posi
2 CONC tions in Alexander’s circle and, like him, were educated at the Macedonian court in Pella.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was probably appointed Somatophylax during the reign of Philip II. During Alexander's Persian campaigns, in 328 BC he was one of his immediate bodyguards. In 324 BC, in Susa, he was crowned in r
2 CONC ecognition for his actions in India. After Alexander’s death in 323 BC, he was appointed to the government of Thrace as strategos although he faced some difficulties from the Thracian dynast Seuthes
2 CONC .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Diadochi'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 315 BC, Lysimachus joined Cassander, Ptolemy I Soter and Seleucus I Nicator against Antigonus I Monophthalmus, who, however, diverted his attention by stirring up Thracian and Scythian tribes ag
2 CONC ainst him. However, he managed to consolidate his power in the east of his territories, suppressing a revolt of the cities on the Black Sea coast.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 309 BC, he founded Lysimachia in a commanding situation on the neck connecting the Chersonese with the mainland which formed a bulwark against the Odrysians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 306/305 BC, Lysimachus followed the example of Antigonus I assumed the title of "King", which he held until his death at Corupedium in 281 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 302 BC, when the second affiance between Cassander, Ptolemy I and Seleucus I was made, Lysimachus, reinforced by troops from Cassander, entered Asia Minor, where he met with little resistance. O
2 CONC n the approach of Antigonus I he retired into winter quarters near Heraclea, marrying its widowed queen Amastris, a Persian princess. Seleucus I joined him in 301 BC, and at the Battle of Ipsus Antigo
2 CONC nus I was defeated and slain. Antigonus' dominions were divided among the victors. Lysimachus' share was Lydia, Ionia, Phrygia and the north coast of Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Feeling that Seleucus I was becoming dangerously powerful, Lysimachus now allied himself with Ptolemy I, marrying his daughter Arsinoe II of Egypt. Amastris, who had divorced herself from him, retu
2 CONC rned to Heraclea. When Antigonus I’s son Demetrius I renewed hostilities (297 BC), during his absence in Greece, Lysimachus seized his towns in Asia Minor, but in 294 BC concluded a peace whereby De
2 CONC metrius I was recognized as ruler of Macedonia. He tried to carry his power beyond the Danube, but was defeated and taken prisoner by the Getae king Dromichaetes (or Dromihete), who, however, set him 
2 CONC free in 292 BC on amicable terms in return for Lysimachus surrendering the Danubian lands he had captured.[1] Demetrius I subsequently threatened Thrace, but had to retire due to a sudden uprising in 
2 CONC Boeotia, and an attack from King Pyrrhus of Epirus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 287 BC, Lysimachus and Pyrrhus in turn invaded Macedonia, and drove Demetrius I out of the country. Lysimachus left Pyrrhus in possession of Macedonia with the title of king for around seven mon
2 CONC ths before Lysimachus invaded. For a short while the two ruled jointly but in 285 BC Lysimachus expelled Pyrrhus, seizing complete control for himself.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Later years'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Domestic troubles embittered the last years of Lysimachus’ life. Amastris had been murdered by her two sons; Lysimachus treacherously put them to death. On his return, Arsinoe II asked the gift o
2 CONC f Heraclea, and he granted her request, though he had promised to free the city. In 284 BC Arsinoe II, desirous of gaining the succession for her sons in preference to Lysimachus’ first child, Agath
2 CONC ocles, intrigued against him with the help of Arsinoe II’s paternal half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos; they accused him of conspiring with Seleucus I to seize the throne, and Agathocles was put to death
2 CONC .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This atrocious deed by Lysimachus aroused great indignation. Many of the cities of Asia Minor revolted, and his most trusted friends deserted him. The widow of Agathocles and their children fled to
2 CONC  Seleucus I, who at once invaded the territory of Lysimachus in Asia Minor. In 281 BC, Lysimachus crossed the Hellespont into Lydia and at the decisive Battle of Corupedium was killed. After some days
2 CONC  his body was found on the field, protected from birds of prey by his faithful dog. Lysimachus' body was given over to another son Alexander, by whom it was interred at Lysimachia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Marriages and children'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p># First marriage: Nicaea a Greek Macedonian noblewoman and daughter of the powerful Regent Antipater. Lysimachus and Nicaea married in c. 321 BC. Nicaea bore Lysimachus three children (one son, two
2 CONC  daughter) : Agathocles, Eurydice, Arsinoe I
2 CONT <p># Second marriage: Persian Princess Amastris. Lysimachus married her in 302 BC. Amastris and Lysimachus’ union was brief, as he ended their marriage and divorced her in 300/299 BC. Amastris had t
2 CONC wo sons from a previous marriage. During their brief marriage, Amastris may have borne Lysimachus a child, perhaps a daughter who may have been the first wife of Ptolemy Keraunos.
2 CONT <p># Third marriage: Ptolemaic Greek Princess Arsinoe II. Arsinoe II married Lysimachus in 300/299 BC and remained with him until his death in 281 BC. Arsinoe II bore Lysimachus three sons: Ptolemy I

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy, son of a Macedonian nobleman and the most trusted of Alexander'sgenerals, was among the seven bodyguards attached to his person. In thedivision of the empire, Ptolemy takes Egypt as the sa
2 CONC fest and farthestplace to establish a dynasty. He even manages to carry off the body ofAlexander from Babylon to Egypt in order to bury him in Alexandria andthus enhance his own position.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Later Ptolemy mints a gold coin at Alexandria on which we see a car drawnby four elephants. Perhaps this is an attempt made by him to representAlexander's funeral cortege that included elephants.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antipater establishes himself in Macedon. He dies soon after and issucceeded by Cassander, his son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus Nicator, a youth of twenty-three of age when he accompaniesAlexander to Asia, wins distinction in the Indian campaign. Seleucus isgiven the government of the Babylonian satrapy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus defeats Eumenes, installed as satrap of Cappadocia, and has himput to death. He thus gets rid of his most dangerous rival. OstensiblyAntigonus and his son Demetrius Poliocertes hope to re
2 CONC unify Alexander'scollapsing empire but for their own purposes. Antigonus also controlsparts of Greece, Asia Minor and Syria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus sets himself up in Thrace.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Military clashes eventually occur as each tries to encroach on theother's territory. Ptolemy annexes Phoenicia to his possessions andplaces garrisons in the Phoenician port cities. Antigonus too de
2 CONC cides toenlarge his territory and set himself up as king of Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Returning from successful wars in Babylonia, Antigonus easily takes overthe cities of Phoenicia but meets with firm resistance from Tyre.Seventeen years have passed since Alexander took Tyre and th
2 CONC e city hasrecovered rapidly. Antigonus has few ships as Ptolemy is holding allPhoenician vessels and their crews in Egypt, so he decides to build afleet of his own. He camps before Tyre, summons all t
2 CONC he kings of thePhoenician cities and the viceroys of Syria and demands them to assisthim in building ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus blockades Tyre by land. He establishes three shipyards, one atTripolis, one at Byblos, one at Sidon. Diodorus Siculus records thatAntigonus collects wood-cutters, sawyers and shipwrights 
2 CONC from all regionsand has wood carried from the mountains of Lebanon to the sea. Eightthousand men are employed to cut and saw the timber; one thousand pairsof draught animals are used to transport it. 
2 CONC "This mountain range",Diodorus (19.58.3-5) writes, "extends along the territory of Tripolis,Byblos and Sidon and is covered with cedar and cypress trees of wonderfulbeauty and size." We thus have a de
2 CONC scription of the extent of theluxuriant forests covering the mountains of Lebanon about two thousandthree hundred years ago.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After a siege of fifteen months, Tyre is taken by Antigonus. He allowsPtolemy's garrison to leave and establishes his own in the city.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In order to enhance their personal prestige, Alexander's successorsstrike their own coins. On the obverse of his early silver coinage,Ptolemy has engraved the head of the newly deified Alexander wi
2 CONC th thesacred ram's horns of Ammon and an elephant headdress. Alexander's name,not his, appears on the reverse of his coins.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the coins of Seleucus, Alexander is portrayed as the god Dionysuswearing a helmet covered with panther skin adorned with a bull's ear andhorns.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus in his turn presents on his coins the diademed head ofAlexander, deified, wearing the sacred horns of Ammon. When Alexanderconquered Egypt, he was hailed by the high-priest of Ammon as t
2 CONC he son ofthe god and Alexander's generals are determined to let no one forget it.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 305 B.C. Antigonus and his son Demetrius assume the title of king.Ptolemy, Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus react to the challenge bydoing the same. Henceforth the effigies of these men, weari
2 CONC ng theMacedonian diadem, appear on their gold and silver coins. Their patrongods appear on the reverse. This ushurs in the age of royal portraiture.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The battle of lpsus in Phrygia in 301, called the "battle of the kings",signals the great military clash between Alexander's generals. The warelephant plays an important role in the outcome of this
2 CONC  battle and is thesymbol of military strength. The armies of Seleucus and Lysimachus withone hundred and fifty elephants cut off the infantry of Antigonus, leftmortally wounded on the battlefield.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notwithstanding, his son Demetrius rules Phoenicia until 287 when it onceagain passes back to Ptolemy. It remains a dependency of the Ptolemiesfor nearly seventy years. In the year 285 Alexander's 
2 CONC empire is neatlydivided between three of his former generals, Ptolemy in Egypt, Seleucusin Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and Lysimachus in Thrace.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At his death at the age of eight-four Ptolemy leaves behind him a wellorganized kingdom and the great library at Alexandria. He is succeeded byhis son, Ptolemy 11 Philadelphus (285-246).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The persistent lug of war between Ptolemies and Seleucids over Phoenicia,Syria and Palestine also results in great cultural changes in the region.Phoenician is discarded as a literary language and 
2 CONC is replaced by Greek.Greek religious practices and beliefs take root but at the same time aPhoenician god travels south to Egypt and is honored with great pomp inAlexandria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Byblos is the center for the worship of Adonis, a youth of great beauty,loved by Aphrodite. In legendary tradition, Adonis is hunting the wildboar one day in the company of Aphrodite at Afka, the s
2 CONC ource of a riverhigh up in the mountains of Lebanon. The boar turns on him and gores histhigh. Adonis dies of the wound as his blood flows into the river turningthe waters red and the anemones in the 
2 CONC river valley scarlet. Aphroditeappeals to Zeus, king of the gods, to bring her lover back to life. Zeuspities the youth and allows him to pass part of the year on earth, theother part underground in H
2 CONC ades. His death is mourned annually at Byblos.He returns in the spring time to the upper world and there is greatrejoicing. Adonis in Phoenician means "lord" and is the title given tothe young god of 
2 CONC vegetation.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Theocritus, a Greek poet born in Syracuse c. 315 B.C., lived inAlexandria in the time of Ptolemy if Philadelphus. In his Idyll 15 hedescribes how the Festival of Adonis is celebrated in the city. O
2 CONC n thefirst day a great procession forms as women and children pour out intothe crowded streets to watch. Adonis has come back to life for a briefreunion with Aphrodite and there is great rejoicing. Th
2 CONC e second day isone of mourning as the women bewail the god's departure once again forthe underworld.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Alexandria, Adonis is represented by a graceful statue reclining on asilver couch in a temporary bower ornamented with birds and cupids. He isportrayed as a beautiful youth and the women cluster
2 CONC  around him as he iscarried through the streets in the procession. The crowd enters the royalpalace as part of the ceremony is performed there. Praises are sung toQueen Berenice, the mother of Philade
2 CONC lphus and Arsinoë, his sister-wife,one way of eulogizing the family of Ptolemy who patronize the festival.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the second day the women lament the departure of the youthful god. Atthe end of the festival the statue of Adonis is carried outside the cityand flung into the sea amidst the wailing and weeping
2 CONC  of the women.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The years roll by...</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Egypt descendants of Ptolemy rule at Alexandria, one after the other.In Syria a line of Seleucid kings, usurpers and imposters alike, sit onthe throne of Antioch.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great (223-187) makes Phoenicia abattlefield in his wars against the Ptolemies. Antiochus III drives theforces of Ptolemy IV Philopator out of Syria, takes Tyre 
2 CONC and Acre(Ptolemais) and even threatens Egypt. In the following years the citiesof Phoenicia pass back and forth between the two powers. In 196 B.C.Phoenicia and Coele Syria (the Bekaa valley) pass int
2 CONC o the possession ofthe Seleucid kings. The Phoenician cities welcome the change, for theestablishment and commercial expansion of Alexandria is a threat to theircommerce.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The discovery in 1897 of several painted funerary stelae in a gardensouth of Sidon point to the presence of Greek mercenaries in the armiesof the Seleucids during the second century B.C. These sold
2 CONC iers of fortunefrom the Greek mainland and cities of Asia Minor died here while onactive duty and were laid to rest forever in foreign land. The stelaetoday are exposed in the Archaeological Museum, I

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Seleucid monarchy is now in a state of chronic civil war. In thestruggle to seize the throne between the usurper Tryphon and AntiochusVII Sidetes during the latter part of the second century B.
2 CONC C., thesituation becomes so unbearable that merchants of Beirut desert the cityand open commercial establishments on the Greek island of Delos wherethey conduct a flourishing business.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But in the West the rise of Rome presents a danger. The Italian wars of91-83 B.C. keep the Romans at home. The chaotic conditions in Syriapermit Tigranes 11 the Great, king of Armenia, to overrun C

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 69 B.C. the Roman general Lucullus arrives in the East, crosses theEuphrates in pursuit of Tigranes and invades Armenia. However his armydoes not support him so he withdraws to Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pompey replaces Lucullus in 66 B.C. Syria is taken out of the hands ofthe Seleucids once and for all on the ground that they have virtuallyceased to rule. Pompey turns the districts of the Seleucid
2 CONC  territory,including Phoenicia, Syria and Palestine into a new province named"Syria". Although this political move consolidates Roman authority in theEast and increases the annual revenue of the Roman
2 CONC  treasury, in return ameasure of security is given to the peoples of the region that they hadnot enjoyed since the conquests of Alexander. Anarchy and piracy isbrought under control and the cities of

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus (c. 360 BC–281 BC, Greek: ??s?µa???) was a Macedonian officer and "successor" (diadochus) of Alexander the Great, later a king (306 BC) in Thrace and Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Son of Agathocles, he was from Pella in Macedonia. During Alexander's Persian campaigns he was one of his immediate bodyguard and distinguished himself in India. After Alexander’s death (323 BC) 
2 CONC he was appointed to the government of Thrace and the Chersonese. For a long time he was chiefly occupied with fighting against the Odrysian king Seuthes III.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 315 BC he joined Cassander, Ptolemy and Seleucus against Antigonus, who, however, diverted his attention by stirring up Thracian and Scythian tribes against him. In 309 BC, he founded Lysimachia
2 CONC  in a commanding situation on the neck connecting the Chersonese with the mainland. He followed the example of Antigonus in taking the title of king. In 302 when the second affiance between Cassander,
2 CONC  Ptolemy and Seleucus was made, Lysimachus, reinforced by troops from Cassander, entered Asia Minor, where he met with little resistance. On the approach of Antigonus he retired into winter quarters n
2 CONC ear Heraclea, marrying its widowed queen Amastris, a Persian princess. Seleucus joined him in 301 BC, and at the battle of Ipsus Antigonus was defeated and slain. His dominions were divided among the 
2 CONC victors, Lysimachus receiving the greater part of Asia Minor.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Feeling that Seleucus was becoming dangerously great, Lysimachus now allied himself with Ptolemy, marrying his daughter Arsinoe II of Egypt. Amastris, who had divorced herself from him, returned to
2 CONC  Heraclea. When Antigonus’s son Demetrius I of Macedon renewed hostilities (297 BC), during his absence in Greece, Lysimachus seized his towns in Asia Minor, but in 294 BC concluded a peace whereby 
2 CONC Demetrius was recognized as ruler of Macedonia. He tried to carry his power beyond the Danube, but was defeated and taken prisoner by the Getae king Dromichaetes (Dromihete), who, however, set him fre
2 CONC e on amicable terms. Demetrius subsequently threatened Thrace, but had to retire in consequence of a rising in Boeotia, and an attack from Pyrrhus of Epirus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 288 BC Lysimachus and Pyrrhus in turn invaded Macedonia, and drove Demetrius out of the country. Pyrrhus was at first allowed to remain in possession of Macedonia with the title of king, but in 
2 CONC 285 BC he was expelled by Lysimachus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Domestic troubles embittered the last years of Lysimachus’s life. Amastris had been murdered by her two sons; Lysimachus treacherously put them to death. On his return Arsinoe asked the gift of H
2 CONC eraclea, and he granted her request, though he had promised to free the city. In 284 BC Arsinoe, desirous of gaining the succession for her sons in preference to Agathocles (the eldest son of Lysimach
2 CONC us), intrigued against him with the help of her brother Ptolemy Keraunos; they accused him of conspiring with Seleucus to seize the throne, and he was put to death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This atrocious deed of Lysimachus aroused great indignation. Many of the cities of Asia revolted, and his most trusted friends deserted him. The widow of Agathocles fled to Seleucus, who at once in
2 CONC vaded the territory of Lysimachus in Asia. In 281 BC, Lysimachus crossed the Hellespont into Lydia, and at the decisive Battle of Corupedium was killed. After some days his body, watched by a faithful
2 CONC  dog, was found on the field, and given up to his son Alexander, by whom it was interred at Lysimachia.

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nicaea (Greek: Nίκαια, c. 335 BC-about 302 BC) was a Greek Macedonian noblewoman and was a daughter of the powerful regent Antipater by unnamed mother. She was born and raised in Macedonia whe
2 CONC n her father was governor of Macedonia during the reign of Greek King Alexander the Great.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nicaea was sent by her father to Asia accompanied by her brother Iollas and a certain Archias in 323 BC to be married to the powerful Perdiccas, at a time when it was still hoped to maintain friend
2 CONC ly relations with the regent. Perdiccas, though already entertaining hostile designs married Nicaea. Not so long afterwards by the advice of Eumenes determined to divorce Nicaea, married Cleopatra of 
2 CONC Macedon instead, the full-blooded sister of Alexander the Great. This step that Perdiccas took before setting out on his expedition to Ancient Egypt, led to an immediate rupture between Perdiccas and 
2 CONC Antipater.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In c. 321 BC,[6] in part of a formed alliance Antipater married Nicaea to Lysimachus who governed Thrace. In 306 BC Lysimachus became King of ruling Thrace, Asia Minor and Macedon. Through her marr
2 CONC iage, Nicaea became a Queen consort.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nicaea bore Lysimachus three children: one son Agathocles; two daughters: Eurydice and Arsinoe I. Through Arsinoe I, Nicaea would have further descendants.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nicaea died at an unknown date from unknown causes sometime between 302 BC and 300 BC. In c. 300 BC, Lysimachus renamed a city in Bithynia, Asia Minor, called Nicaea (modern İznik, Turkey) in hono
2 CONC r of his late wife.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy I Soter, was (perhaps) a half brother of Alexander the Great, King of Macedonia and served under him as a Macedonian General. He later acquired the title of King of Egypt (born circa 367 BC
2 CONC , died circa 283 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Arsinoe of Macedonia (Greek: Ἀρσινόη; lived 4th century BC) was the mother of Ptolemy I Soter (323 BC – 283 BC), king of Egypt. She was originally a concubine of Philip II, king of Macedo
2 CONC n, and it is said she was given by Philip to Lagus, a Macedonian, while she was pregnant with Ptolemy. Ptolemy I Soter was regarded by the Macedonians as the son of Philip II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>NB:  that account is likely fictitious since Macedonian nobility placed a great premium on legitimacy of children born within formal, official marriages.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy I Soter I (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Σωτήρ, Ptolemaĩos Sōtḗr, i.e. Ptolemy (pronounced /ˈtɒləmi/) the Savior, c. 367 BC – c. 283 BC) was a Macedonian Greek general under Al
2 CONC exander the Great, who became ruler of Egypt (323 BC – 283 BC) and founder of both the Ptolemaic Kingdom and the Ptolemaic Dynasty. In 305/4 BC he took the title of pharaoh.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His mother was Arsinoe of Macedon, and, while his father is unknown, ancient sources variously describe him either as the son of Lagus, a Macedonian nobleman, or as an illegitimate son of Philip II
2 CONC  of Macedon (which, if true would have made Ptolemy the half-brother of Alexander). Ptolemy was one of Alexander's most trusted generals, and was among the seven somatophylakes (bodyguards) attached t
2 CONC o his person. He was a few years older than Alexander, and had been his intimate friend since childhood. He may even have been in the group of noble teenagers tutored by Aristotle.[citation needed]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy served with Alexander from his first campaigns, and played a principal part in the later campaigns in Afghanistan and India. At the Susa marriage festival in 324, Alexander had Ptolemy marr
2 CONC ied the Persian princess Artakama. Ptolemy also had a consort in Thaïs, the Athenian hetaera and one of Alexander's companions in his conquest of the ancient world.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>== Successor of Alexander ==</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Alexander died in 323 BC Ptolemy is said to have instigated the resettlement of the empire made at Babylon. Through the Partition of Babylon, he was appointed satrap of Egypt, under the nomina
2 CONC l kings Philip Arrhidaeus and the infant Alexander IV; the former satrap, the Greek Cleomenes, stayed on as his deputy. Ptolemy quickly moved, without authorization, to subjugate Cyrenaica.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By custom, kings in Macedonia asserted their right to the throne by burying their predecessor. Probably because he wanted to pre-empt Perdiccas, the imperial regent, from staking his claim in this 
2 CONC way, Ptolemy took great pains in acquiring the body of Alexander the Great, placing it temporarily in Memphis, Egypt. Ptolemy then openly joined the coalition against Perdiccas. Perdiccas appears to h
2 CONC ave suspected Ptolemy of aiming for the throne himself, and may have decided that Ptolemy was his most dangerous rival. Ptolemy executed Cleomenes for spying on behalf of Perdiccas — this removed th
2 CONC e chief check on his authority, and allowed Ptolemy to obtain the huge sum that Cleomenes had accumulated.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>== Rivalry and wars ==</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 321, Perdiccas invaded Egypt. Ptolemy decided to defend the Nile, and Perdiccas's attempt to force it ended in fiasco, with the loss of 2000 men. This was a fatal blow to Perdiccas' reputation, 
2 CONC and he was murdered in his tent by two of his subordinates. Ptolemy immediately crossed the Nile, to provide supplies to what had the day before been an enemy army. Ptolemy was offered the regency in 
2 CONC place of Perdiccas; but he declined.[2] Ptolemy was consistent in his policy of securing a power base, while never succumbing to the temptation of risking all to succeed Alexander.[3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the long wars that followed between the different Diadochi, Ptolemy's first goal was to hold Egypt securely, and his second was to secure control in the outlying areas: Cyrenaica and Cyprus, as 
2 CONC well as Syria, including the province of Judea. His first occupation of Syria was in 318, and he established at the same time a protectorate over the petty kings of Cyprus. When Antigonus One-Eye, mas
2 CONC ter of Asia in 315, showed dangerous ambitions, Ptolemy joined the coalition against him, and on the outbreak of war, evacuated Syria. In Cyprus, he fought the partisans of Antigonus, and re-conquered
2 CONC  the island (313). A revolt in Cyrene was crushed the same year.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 312, Ptolemy and Seleucus, the fugitive satrap of Babylonia, both invaded Syria, and defeated Demetrius Poliorcetes ("besieger of cities"), the son of Antigonus, in the Battle of Gaza. Again he 
2 CONC occupied Syria, and again—after only a few months, when Demetrius had won a battle over his general, and Antigonus entered Syria in force—he evacuated it. In 311, a peace was concluded between the
2 CONC  combatants. Soon after this, the surviving 13-year-old king, Alexander IV, was murdered in Macedonia, leaving the satrap of Egypt absolutely his own master. The peace did not last long, and in 309 Pt
2 CONC olemy personally commanded a fleet that detached the coastal towns of Lycia and Caria from Antigonus, then crossed into Greece, where he took possession of Corinth, Sicyon and Megara (308 BC). In 306,
2 CONC  a great fleet under Demetrius attacked Cyprus, and Ptolemy's brother Menelaus was defeated and captured in another decisive Battle of Salamis. Ptolemy's complete loss of Cyprus followed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The satraps Antigonus and Demetrius now each assumed the title of king; Ptolemy, as well as Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus I Nicator, responded by doing the same. In the winter of 306 BC, Antig
2 CONC onus tried to follow up his victory in Cyprus by invading Egypt; but Ptolemy was strongest there, and successfully held the frontier against him. Ptolemy led no further overseas expeditions against An
2 CONC tigonus. However, he did send great assistance to Rhodes when it was besieged by Demetrius (305/304). Pausanius reports that the grateful Rhodians bestowed the name Soter ("saviour") upon him as a res
2 CONC ult of lifting the siege. This account is generally accepted by modern scholars, although the earliest datable mention of it is from coins issued by Ptolemy II in 263 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When the coalition against Antigonus was renewed in 302, Ptolemy joined it, and invaded Syria a third time, while Antigonus was engaged with Lysimachus in Asia Minor. On hearing a report that Antig
2 CONC onus had won a decisive victory there, he once again evacuated Syria. But when the news came that Antigonus had been defeated and slain by Lysimachus and Seleucus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301, he occ
2 CONC upied Syria a fourth time.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The other members of the coalition had assigned all Syria to Seleucus, after what they regarded as Ptolemy's desertion, and for the next hundred years, the question of the ownership of southern Syr
2 CONC ia (i.e., Judea) produced recurring warfare between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic dynasties. Henceforth, Ptolemy seems to have mingled as little as possible in the rivalries between Asia Minor and Greece
2 CONC ; he lost what he held in Greece, but reconquered Cyprus in 295/294. Cyrene, after a series of rebellions, was finally subjugated about 300 and placed under his stepson Magas.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>== Successor ==</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 289, Ptolemy made his son by Berenice -- Ptolemy II Philadelphus-- his co-regent. His eldest (legitimate) son, Ptolemy Keraunos, whose mother, Eurydice, the daughter of Antipater, had been repud
2 CONC iated, fled to the court of Lysimachus. Ptolemy I Soter died in 283 at the age of 84. Shrewd and cautious, he had a compact and well-ordered realm to show at the end of forty years of war. His reputat
2 CONC ion for bonhomie and liberality attached the floating soldier-class of Macedonians and Greeks to his service, and was not insignificant; nor did he wholly neglect conciliation of the natives. He was a
2 CONC  ready patron of letters, founding the Great Library of Alexandria. He himself wrote a history of Alexander's campaigns that has not survived. This used to be considered an objective work, distinguish
2 CONC ed by its straightforward honesty and sobriety. However, Ptolemy may have exaggerated his own role, and had propagandist aims in writing his History. Although now lost, it was a principal source for t
2 CONC he surviving account by Arrian of Nicomedia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>== Euclid ==</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy personally sponsored the great mathematician Euclid, but found Euclid's seminal work, the Elements, too difficult to study, so he asked if there were an easier way to master it. Euclid famo

2 CONC  a Macedonian general under Alexander the Great, one of the three Diadochi who succeeded to his empire. Ptolemy became ruler of Egypt (323–283 BC) and founded a dynasty which ruled it for the next t

2 CONC ia (i.e., Judea) produced recurring warfare between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic dynasties. Henceforth, Ptolemy seems to have mingled as little as possible in the rivalries between Asia Minor and Greece
2 CONC ; he lost what he held in Greece, but reconquered Cyprus in 295/294. Cyrene, after a series of rebellions, was finally subjugated about 300 and placed under his stepson Magas.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 289, Ptolemy made his son by Berenice—Ptolemy II Philadelphus—his co-regent. His eldest (legitimate) son, Ptolemy Keraunos, whose mother, Eurydice, the daughter of Antipater, had been repudi
2 CONC ated, fled to the court of Lysimachus. Ptolemy also had a consort in Thaïs, the Athenian hetaera and one of Alexander's companions in his conquest of the ancient world. Ptolemy I Soter died in 283 at
2 CONC  the age of 84. Shrewd and cautious, he had a compact and well-ordered realm to show at the end of forty years of war. His reputation for bonhomie and liberality attached the floating soldier-class of
2 CONC  Macedonians and other Greeks to his service, and was not insignificant; nor did he wholly neglect conciliation of the natives. He was a ready patron of letters, founding the Great Library of Alexandr
2 CONC ia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He himself wrote a history of Alexander's campaigns that has not survived. This was long considered an objective work, distinguished by its straightforward honesty and sobriety. Arrian of Nicomedia
2 CONC , author of the most widely read account of Alexander the Great, noted that he relied most heavily on Ptolemy's history because "as he himself was a king, mendacity would have been more dishonorable f
2 CONC or him than for anyone else."[9] However, as noted by A.B. Bosworth, an expert on Greek history, Ptolemy may have exaggerated his own role, and had propagandist aims in writing his history.

2 CONT <p>'''Euclid'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy personally sponsored the great mathematician Euclid, but found Euclid's seminal work, the Elements, too difficult to study, so he asked if there were an easier way to master it. According t
2 CONC o Proclus Euclid famously quipped: "Sire, there is no Royal Road to geometry."

2 CONT <p>Diadochi (successors) by the imperial regent Perdiccas (365-321 bc) and</p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy was appointed satrap of Egypt and Libya. He was from the first an
2 CONT <p>independent ruler, engaging in long wars with other Macedonian chiefs in
2 CONT <p>order to secure and extend his rule. Ptolemy was prevented from holding</p>
2 CONT <p>Cyprus and parts of Greece, but he resisted invasions of Egypt and Rhodes
2 CONT <p>and occupied Palestine and Cyrenaica. In 305 bc he assumed the title of</p>
2 CONT <p>king. Alexandria was his capital, and he founded the famous Alexandrian</p>
2 CONT <p>library. He was the author of a lost history of the campaigns of</p>
2 CONT <p>Alexander. In 285 bc Ptolemy I abdicated in favor of one of his younger</p>
2 CONT <p>sons.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The generals who succeed Alexander are Antigonus Cyclops orMonophthalmus, so-called because he lost an eye in battle, and his sonDemetrius Poliocertes, Antipater and his son Cassander, Seleucus,Pto
2 CONC lemy, Eumenes and Lysimachus. They argue bitterly among themselves foreach is determined to build a Hellenistic or Greek monarchy on the ruinsof Alexander's empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy, son of a Macedonian nobleman and the most trusted of Alexander'sgenerals, was among the seven bodyguards attached to his person. In thedivision of the empire, Ptolemy takes Egypt as the sa
2 CONC fest and farthestplace to establish a dynasty. He even manages to carry off the body ofAlexander from Babylon to Egypt in order to bury him in Alexandria andthus enhance his own position.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Later Ptolemy mints a gold coin at Alexandria on which we see a car drawnby four elephants. Perhaps this is an attempt made by him to representAlexander's funeral cortege that included elephants.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antipater establishes himself in Macedon. He dies soon after and issucceeded by Cassander, his son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus Nicator, a youth of twenty-three of age when he accompaniesAlexander to Asia, wins distinction in the Indian campaign. Seleucus isgiven the government of the Babylonian satrapy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus defeats Eumenes, installed as satrap of Cappadocia, and has himput to death. He thus gets rid of his most dangerous rival. OstensiblyAntigonus and his son Demetrius Poliocertes hope to re
2 CONC unify Alexander'scollapsing empire but for their own purposes. Antigonus also controlsparts of Greece, Asia Minor and Syria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus sets himself up in Thrace.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Military clashes eventually occur as each tries to encroach on theother's territory. Ptolemy annexes Phoenicia to his possessions andplaces garrisons in the Phoenician port cities. Antigonus too de
2 CONC cides toenlarge his territory and set himself up as king of Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Returning from successful wars in Babylonia, Antigonus easily takes overthe cities of Phoenicia but meets with firm resistance from Tyre.Seventeen years have passed since Alexander took Tyre and th
2 CONC e city hasrecovered rapidly. Antigonus has few ships as Ptolemy is holding allPhoenician vessels and their crews in Egypt, so he decides to build afleet of his own. He camps before Tyre, summons all t
2 CONC he kings of thePhoenician cities and the viceroys of Syria and demands them to assisthim in building ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus blockades Tyre by land. He establishes three shipyards, one atTripolis, one at Byblos, one at Sidon. Diodorus Siculus records thatAntigonus collects wood-cutters, sawyers and shipwrights 
2 CONC from all regionsand has wood carried from the mountains of Lebanon to the sea. Eightthousand men are employed to cut and saw the timber; one thousand pairsof draught animals are used to transport it. 
2 CONC "This mountain range",Diodorus (19.58.3-5) writes, "extends along the territory of Tripolis,Byblos and Sidon and is covered with cedar and cypress trees of wonderfulbeauty and size." We thus have a de
2 CONC scription of the extent of theluxuriant forests covering the mountains of Lebanon about two thousandthree hundred years ago.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After a siege of fifteen months, Tyre is taken by Antigonus. He allowsPtolemy's garrison to leave and establishes his own in the city.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In order to enhance their personal prestige, Alexander's successorsstrike their own coins. On the obverse of his early silver coinage,Ptolemy has engraved the head of the newly deified Alexander wi
2 CONC th thesacred ram's horns of Ammon and an elephant headdress. Alexander's name,not his, appears on the reverse of his coins.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the coins of Seleucus, Alexander is portrayed as the god Dionysuswearing a helmet covered with panther skin adorned with a bull's ear andhorns.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus in his turn presents on his coins the diademed head ofAlexander, deified, wearing the sacred horns of Ammon. When Alexanderconquered Egypt, he was hailed by the high-priest of Ammon as t
2 CONC he son ofthe god and Alexander's generals are determined to let no one forget it.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 305 B.C. Antigonus and his son Demetrius assume the title of king.Ptolemy, Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus react to the challenge bydoing the same. Henceforth the effigies of these men, weari
2 CONC ng theMacedonian diadem, appear on their gold and silver coins. Their patrongods appear on the reverse. This ushurs in the age of royal portraiture.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The battle of lpsus in Phrygia in 301, called the "battle of the kings",signals the great military clash between Alexander's generals. The warelephant plays an important role in the outcome of this
2 CONC  battle and is thesymbol of military strength. The armies of Seleucus and Lysimachus withone hundred and fifty elephants cut off the infantry of Antigonus, leftmortally wounded on the battlefield.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notwithstanding, his son Demetrius rules Phoenicia until 287 when it onceagain passes back to Ptolemy. It remains a dependency of the Ptolemiesfor nearly seventy years. In the year 285 Alexander's 
2 CONC empire is neatlydivided between three of his former generals, Ptolemy in Egypt, Seleucusin Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and Lysimachus in Thrace.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At his death at the age of eight-four Ptolemy leaves behind him a wellorganized kingdom and the great library at Alexandria. He is succeeded byhis son, Ptolemy 11 Philadelphus (285-246).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The persistent lug of war between Ptolemies and Seleucids over Phoenicia,Syria and Palestine also results in great cultural changes in the region.Phoenician is discarded as a literary language and 
2 CONC is replaced by Greek.Greek religious practices and beliefs take root but at the same time aPhoenician god travels south to Egypt and is honored with great pomp inAlexandria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Byblos is the center for the worship of Adonis, a youth of great beauty,loved by Aphrodite. In legendary tradition, Adonis is hunting the wildboar one day in the company of Aphrodite at Afka, the s
2 CONC ource of a riverhigh up in the mountains of Lebanon. The boar turns on him and gores histhigh. Adonis dies of the wound as his blood flows into the river turningthe waters red and the anemones in the

2 CONC vegetation.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Theocritus, a Greek poet born in Syracuse c. 315 B.C., lived inAlexandria in the time of Ptolemy if Philadelphus. In his Idyll 15 hedescribes how the Festival of Adonis is celebrated in the city. O

2 CONT <p>In Alexandria, Adonis is represented by a graceful statue reclining on asilver couch in a temporary bower ornamented with birds and cupids. He isportrayed as a beautiful youth and the women cluster

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy I SOTER (Greek: Saviour) (b. 367/366 or 364 BC, Macedonia--d.283/282, Egypt), Macedonian general of Alexander the Great, who became ruler of Egypt (323-285 BC) and founder of the Ptolemaic 
2 CONC dynasty, which reigned longer than any other dynasty established on the soil of the Alexandrian empire and only succumbed to the Romans in 30 BC.
2 CONT <p>Early life and career.</p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy was the son of the nobleman Lagus, a native of the Macedoniandistrict of Eordaea whose family was undistinguished until Ptolemy's time, and of Arsinoe, who was related to the Macedonian Arg
2 CONC ead dynasty. He was probably educated as a page at the royal court of Macedonia,where he became closely associated with Alexander. He was exiled in 337, along with other companions of the crown prince
2 CONC . When he returned,after Alexander's accession to the throne in 336, he joined the King's bodyguard, took part in Alexander's European campaigns of 336-335, and in the fall of 330 was appointed person
2 CONC al bodyguard (somatophylax)to Alexander; in this capacity he captured the assassin of Darius III, the Persian emperor, in 329. He was closely associated with Alexander during the advance through the P
2 CONC ersian highland. As a result of Ptolemy's successful military performance on the way from Bactria (in northeastern Afghanistan) to the Indus River (327-325), he became commander (trierarchos) of the M
2 CONC acedonian fleet on the Hydaspes (modern Jhelum in India). Alexander decorated him several times for his deeds and married him to the Persian Artacama at the mass wedding at Susa, the Persian capital, 
2 CONC which was the crowning event of Alexander's policy of merging the Macedonian and Iranian populations.
2 CONT <p>Satrap of Egypt.</p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy, who distinguished himself as a cautious and trustworthy troop commander under Alexander, also proved to be a politician of unusual diplomatic and strategic ability in the long series of st
2 CONC ruggles over the throne that broke out after Alexander's death in 323. Convincedfrom the outset that the generals could not maintain the unity of Alexander's empire, he proposed during the council at 
2 CONC Babylon, which followed Alexander's death, that the satrapies (the provinces of the huge empire) be divided among the generals. He became satrap of Egypt, withthe adjacent Libyan and Arabian regions, 
2 CONC and methodically took advantage of the geographic isolation of the Nile territory to make it a great Hellenistic power. He took steps to improve internal administrationand to acquire several external 
2 CONC possessions in Cyrenaica (the easternmost part of Libya), Cyprus, and Syria and on the coast of Asia Minor;these, he hoped, would guarantee him military security. Although he pursued a friendly policy
2 CONC  toward Greece that secured his political influence there, he also succeeded in winning over the native Egyptian population.
2 CONT <p>In 322 Ptolemy, taking advantage of internal disturbances, acquired the African Hellenic towns of Cyrenaica. In 322-321, as a member of a coalition of "successors" (diadochoi) of Alexander, he foug
2 CONC ht against Perdiccas, the ruler (chiliarchos) of the Asiatic region of the empire.The coalition was victorious and Perdiccas died during the fighting. Ptolemy's diplomatic talent was put to the test d
2 CONC uring this war. When the satrapies were redistributed at Triparadisus in northern Syria, Antipater, the general of the European region, became regent of the Macedonian empire and Ptolemy was confirmed
2 CONC  in possession of Egypt and Cyrene. He further strengthened his position by marrying Eurydice, the third daughter of Antipater.
2 CONT <p>About 317 he married Berenice I, the granddaughter of Cassander, the son of Antipater. Cassander, at his father's death in 319, refused to accept his father's successor, made war upon him, seized p
2 CONC art of the empire, and in 305 assumed the title of king of Macedonia. In the coalition war of 315-311, Ptolemy obtained possession of Cyprus. In this war he scored his most important victory in the ba
2 CONC ttle near Gaza in 312, in which the Egyptian contingents were decisive. But war broke out anew in 310, and he lost Cyprus again in 306. He temporarily lost Cyrene as well and was unable to hold the im
2 CONC portant Greek positions of Corinth and neighbouring Sicyon and Megara, which he had captured in 308.He ultimately suffered overwhelming defeat in 306 in the naval battlenear Salamis on Cyprus. The vic
2 CONC tor in this battle, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, who was assisted by his son, Demetrius Poliorcetes, assumed the title of king in 306. The remaining satraps, led by Ptolemy after he successfully resiste
2 CONC d Antigonus' attack on Egypt, also took the title of king in 305-304.
2 CONT <p>King of Egypt.</p>
2 CONT <p>After naming himself king, Ptolemy's first concern was the continuingwar with Antigonus, which was now focussed on the island of Rhodes. In 304 Ptolemy aided the inhabitants of Rhodes against Antig
2 CONC onus and was accorded the divine title Soter (Saviour), which he was commonly called from that time. The dissolution of Alexander's empire was broughtto a close with the battle near Ipsus in Asia Mino
2 CONC r in 301. During this battle Antigonus was defeated by the other kings. This led to the attempt by the remaining successors of Alexander to define their kingdoms. For this reason a dispute arose betwe
2 CONC en Ptolemy and Seleucus I Nicator of Babylon over Syria, particularly the southern Syrian ports, which served as terminal points for the caravan routes. This quarrel, however, was temporarily settled 
2 CONC peacefully through compromise. In addition to Coele Syria (Palestine), Ptolemy apparently also occupied Pamphylia, Lycia, and part of Pisidia in southern Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p>During the last 15 years of his reign, because of the defeats he suffered between 308 and 306, Ptolemy preferred to secure and expand his empire through a policy of alliances and marriages rather t
2 CONC han through warfare. In 300 he concluded an alliance with Lysimachus of Thrace (modern Bulgaria) and gave him his daughter Arsinoe II in marriage in 299/298. At approximately the same time he married 
2 CONC his stepdaughter Theoxena to Agathocles, the tyrant of Syracuse (southeastern Sicily). About296 he made peace with Demetrius Poliorcetes, to whom he betrothed his daughter Ptolemais. To Pyrrhus of Epi
2 CONC rus, Demetrius' brother-in-law, who was at the Egyptian court as a hostage, he gave his stepdaughter Antigone. He finally brought rebellious Cyrene into subjection in 298, and in approximately 294 he 
2 CONC gained control over Cyprus and the Phoenician coastal towns of Tyre and Sidon.
2 CONT <p>In a last coalition war in 288-286, in which Ptolemy, Seleucus, Lysimachus, and Pyrrhus opposed Demetrius, the Egyptian fleet participated decisively in the liberation of Athens from Macedonian occ
2 CONC upation. During this war Ptolemy obtained the protectorate over the League of Islanders, which was established by Antigonus Monophthalmus in 315 and included most of the Greek islands in the Aegean. E
2 CONC gypt's maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean in the ensuing decades was based on this alliance.
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy was able to evaluate the chaotic international situation of this post-Alexandrian era, which was characterized by constantly renewed wars with shifting alliances and coalitions, in realisti
2 CONC c politicalterms. Adhering to a basically defensive foreign policy, he secured Egypt against external enemies and expanded it by means of directly controlled foreign possessions and hegemonic administ
2 CONC rations. He did not,however, neglect to devote attention to the internal organization of the country and to provide for a successor. In 290 he made his wife Berenice queen of Egypt and in 285 (possibl
2 CONC y on June 26) appointed his younger son Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who was born to Berenice in 308, co-regent and successor. The provision for the succession, which was based on examples from the time o
2 CONC f the pharaohs, made possible a peaceful transition when Ptolemy died in the winter of 283-282. The early Ptolemies were occupied with the economic exploitation of Egypt, but, because of the lack of f
2 CONC irst-hand information, the details of Ptolemy's participation in the process cannot be determined. It is certain, however, that discrimination against the Egyptians took place during his reign. The on
2 CONC ly town he founded was Ptolemais in Upper Egypt. He probably placed Macedonian military commanders alongside the Egyptian provincial administrators and intervened unobtrusively in legal and financial 
2 CONC affairs. In order to regulate the latter, he introduced coinage, which until that time was unknown in Egypt.
2 CONT <p>He found it necessary from the outset, however, to pursue a conciliatory policy toward the Egyptians, since Egyptians had to be recruited for his army, which initially numbered only 4,000 men. Ptol
2 CONC emy won overthe Egyptians through the establishment in Memphis of the Sarapis cult, which fused the Egyptian and Greek religions; through restoration of the temples of the pharaohs, which had been des
2 CONC troyed by the Persians; and through gifts to the ancient Egyptian gods and patronage of the Egyptian nobility and priesthood. Finally, he founded the Museum (Mouseion), a common workplace for scholars
2 CONC  and artists, and establishedthe famous library at Alexandria. Besides being a patron of the arts and sciences, he was a writer himself. In the last few years of his life Ptolemy wrote a generally rel
2 CONC iable history of Alexander's campaigns. Although it is now lost, it can be largely reconstructed through the extensive use made of it later by the historian Arrian.
2 CONT <p>Several times during his life Ptolemy was proclaimed a deity by certain classes of people. After his death he was raised to the level of a god by all the Egyptians.

2 CONC d Antigonus' attack on Egypt, also took the title of king in 305-304.
2 CONT <p>King of Egypt.</p>
2 CONT <p>After naming himself king, Ptolemy's first concern was the continuingwar with Antigonus, which was now focussed on the island of Rhodes. In 304 Ptolemy aided the inhabitants of Rhodes against Antig
2 CONC onus and was accorded the divine title Soter (Saviour), which he was commonly called from that time. The dissolution of Alexander's empire was broughtto a close with the battle near Ipsus in Asia Mino
2 CONC r in 301. During this battle Antigonus was defeated by the other kings. This led to the attempt by the remaining successors of Alexander to define their kingdoms. For this reason a dispute arose betwe
2 CONC en Ptolemy and Seleucus I Nicator of Babylon over Syria, particularly the southern Syrian ports, which served as terminal points for the caravan routes. This quarrel, however, was temporarily settled 
2 CONC peacefully through compromise. In addition to Coele Syria (Palestine), Ptolemy apparently also occupied Pamphylia, Lycia, and part of Pisidia in southern Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p>During the last 15 years of his reign, because of the defeats he suffered between 308 and 306, Ptolemy preferred to secure and expand his empire through a policy of alliances and marriages rather t
2 CONC han through warfare. In 300 he concluded an alliance with Lysimachus of Thrace (modern Bulgaria) and gave him his daughter Arsinoe II in marriage in 299/298. At approximately the same time he married 
2 CONC his stepdaughter Theoxena to Agathocles, the tyrant of Syracuse (southeastern Sicily). About296 he made peace with Demetrius Poliorcetes, to whom he betrothed his daughter Ptolemais. To Pyrrhus of Epi
2 CONC rus, Demetrius' brother-in-law, who was at the Egyptian court as a hostage, he gave his stepdaughter Antigone. He finally brought rebellious Cyrene into subjection in 298, and in approximately 294 he 
2 CONC gained control over Cyprus and the Phoenician coastal towns of Tyre and Sidon.
2 CONT <p>In a last coalition war in 288-286, in which Ptolemy, Seleucus, Lysimachus, and Pyrrhus opposed Demetrius, the Egyptian fleet participated decisively in the liberation of Athens from Macedonian occ
2 CONC upation. During this war Ptolemy obtained the protectorate over the League of Islanders, which was established by Antigonus Monophthalmus in 315 and included most of the Greek islands in the Aegean. E
2 CONC gypt's maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean in the ensuing decades was based on this alliance.
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy was able to evaluate the chaotic international situation of this post-Alexandrian era, which was characterized by constantly renewed wars with shifting alliances and coalitions, in realisti
2 CONC c politicalterms. Adhering to a basically defensive foreign policy, he secured Egypt against external enemies and expanded it by means of directly controlled foreign possessions and hegemonic administ
2 CONC rations. He did not,however, neglect to devote attention to the internal organization of the country and to provide for a successor. In 290 he made his wife Berenice queen of Egypt and in 285 (possibl
2 CONC y on June 26) appointed his younger son Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who was born to Berenice in 308, co-regent and successor. The provision for the succession, which was based on examples from the time o
2 CONC f the pharaohs, made possible a peaceful transition when Ptolemy died in the winter of 283-282. The early Ptolemies were occupied with the economic exploitation of Egypt, but, because of the lack of f
2 CONC irst-hand information, the details of Ptolemy's participation in the process cannot be determined. It is certain, however, that discrimination against the Egyptians took place during his reign. The on
2 CONC ly town he founded was Ptolemais in Upper Egypt. He probably placed Macedonian military commanders alongside the Egyptian provincial administrators and intervened unobtrusively in legal and financial 
2 CONC affairs. In order to regulate the latter, he introduced coinage, which until that time was unknown in Egypt.
2 CONT <p>He found it necessary from the outset, however, to pursue a conciliatory policy toward the Egyptians, since Egyptians had to be recruited for his army, which initially numbered only 4,000 men. Ptol
2 CONC emy won overthe Egyptians through the establishment in Memphis of the Sarapis cult, which fused the Egyptian and Greek religions; through restoration of the temples of the pharaohs, which had been des
2 CONC troyed by the Persians; and through gifts to the ancient Egyptian gods and patronage of the Egyptian nobility and priesthood. Finally, he founded the Museum (Mouseion), a common workplace for scholars
2 CONC  and artists, and establishedthe famous library at Alexandria. Besides being a patron of the arts and sciences, he was a writer himself. In the last few years of his life Ptolemy wrote a generally rel

2 CONC dynasty, which reigned longer than any other dynasty established on the soil of the Alexandrian empire and only succumbed to the Romans in 30 BC.
2 CONT <p>Early life and career.</p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy was the son of the nobleman Lagus, a native of the Macedoniandistrict of Eordaea whose family was undistinguished until Ptolemy's time, and of Arsinoe, who was related to the Macedonian Arg
2 CONC ead dynasty. He was probably educated as a page at the royal court of Macedonia,where he became closely associated with Alexander. He was exiled in 337, along with other companions of the crown prince
2 CONC . When he returned,after Alexander's accession to the throne in 336, he joined the King's bodyguard, took part in Alexander's European campaigns of 336-335, and in the fall of 330 was appointed person
2 CONC al bodyguard (somatophylax)to Alexander; in this capacity he captured the assassin of Darius III, the Persian emperor, in 329. He was closely associated with Alexander during the advance through the P
2 CONC ersian highland. As a result of Ptolemy's successful military performance on the way from Bactria (in northeastern Afghanistan) to the Indus River (327-325), he became commander (trierarchos) of the M
2 CONC acedonian fleet on the Hydaspes (modern Jhelum in India). Alexander decorated him several times for his deeds and married him to the Persian Artacama at the mass wedding at Susa, the Persian capital, 
2 CONC which was the crowning event of Alexander's policy of merging the Macedonian and Iranian populations.
2 CONT <p>Satrap of Egypt.</p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy, who distinguished himself as a cautious and trustworthy troop commander under Alexander, also proved to be a politician of unusual diplomatic and strategic ability in the long series of st
2 CONC ruggles over the throne that broke out after Alexander's death in 323. Convincedfrom the outset that the generals could not maintain the unity of Alexander's empire, he proposed during the council at 
2 CONC Babylon, which followed Alexander's death, that the satrapies (the provinces of the huge empire) be divided among the generals. He became satrap of Egypt, withthe adjacent Libyan and Arabian regions, 
2 CONC and methodically took advantage of the geographic isolation of the Nile territory to make it a great Hellenistic power. He took steps to improve internal administrationand to acquire several external 
2 CONC possessions in Cyrenaica (the easternmost part of Libya), Cyprus, and Syria and on the coast of Asia Minor;these, he hoped, would guarantee him military security. Although he pursued a friendly policy

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy I Soter (Greek: ?t??eµa??? S?t?? Ptolemaios Soter, 367 BC—283 BC) was a Macedonian general who became the ruler of Egypt (323 BC—283 BC) and founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty. In 305 BC
2 CONC  he took the title of King.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was the son of Arsinoe of Macedonia -- either by her husband Lagus, a Macedonian nobleman, or by her lover, Philip II of Macedon. Ptolemy was one of Alexander the Great's most trusted generals, 
2 CONC and among the seven "body-guards" attached to his person. He was a few years older than Alexander, and his intimate friend since childhood. He may even have been in the group of noble teenagers tutore
2 CONC d by Aristotle. He was with Alexander from his first campaigns, and played a principal part in the later campaigns in Afghanistan and India. At the Susa marriage festival in 324, Alexander had him mar
2 CONC ry the Persian princess Artacama, but we find no further mention of her. Later, after Alexander's death, Ptolemy married Thaïs, the famous Athenian hetaera and one of Alexander's companions in his co
2 CONC nquest of the ancient world. Thaïs became his queen in Egypt, and even after he divorced her, she reportedly remained his friend, and kept the title of queen while in Memphis.

2 CONT <p>Successor of Alexander</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Alexander died in 323, Ptolemy is said to have instigated the resettlement of the empire made at Babylon. He was now appointed satrap of Egypt, under the nominal kings Philip Arrhidaeus and th
2 CONC e infant Alexander IV; the former satrap, the Greek Cleomenes, stayed on as his deputy. Ptolemy quickly moved, without authorization, to subjugate Cyrenaica.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By custom, kings in Macedonia asserted their right to the throne by burying their predecessor. Probably because he wanted to pre-empt Perdiccas, the imperial regent, from staking his claim in this 
2 CONC way, Ptolemy took great pains in getting his hands on the body of Alexander the Great, placing it temporarily in Memphis. Ptolemy then openly joined the coalition against Perdiccas. Perdiccas appears 
2 CONC to have suspected Ptolemy of aiming for the throne himself, and maybe decided that Ptolemy was his most dangerous rival. Ptolemy executed Cleomenes for spying on behalf of Perdiccas — this removed t
2 CONC he chief check on his authority, and allowed Ptolemy to obtain the huge sum that Cleomenes had accumulated. [1]

2 CONT <p>In 321, Perdiccas invaded Egypt. Ptolemy decided to defend the Nile, and Perdiccas's attempt to force it ended in fiasco, with the loss of 2000 men. This was a fatal blow to Perdiccas' reputation, 
2 CONC and he was murdered in his tent by two of his subordinates. Ptolemy immediately crossed the Nile, to provide supplies to what had the day before been an enemy army. Ptolemy was offered the regency in 
2 CONC place of Perdiccas; but he declined[2]. Ptolemy was consistent in his policy of securing a power base, while never succumbing to the temptation of risking all to succeed Alexander.[3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the long wars that followed between the different Diadochi, Ptolemy's first goal was to hold Egypt securely, and his second was to secure control in the outlying areas: Cyrenaica and Cyprus, as 
2 CONC well as Syria, including the province of Judea. His first occupation of Syria was in 318, and he established at the same time a protectorate over the petty kings of Cyprus. When Antigonus One-Eye, mas
2 CONC ter of Asia in 315, showed dangerous ambitions, Ptolemy joined the coalition against him, and on the outbreak of war, evacuated Syria. In Cyprus, he fought the partisans of Antigonus, and re-conquered
2 CONC  the island (313). A revolt in Cyrene was crushed the same year.

2 CONT <p>In 312, Ptolemy and Seleucus, the fugitive satrap of Babylonia, both invaded Syria, and defeated Demetrius Poliorcetes ("sieger of cities"), the son of Antigonus, in the Battle of Gaza. Again he oc
2 CONC cupied Syria, and again—after only a few months, when Demetrius had won a battle over his general, and Antigonus entered Syria in force—he evacuated it. In 311, a peace was concluded between the c
2 CONC ombatants. Soon after this, the surviving 13-year-old king, Alexander IV, was murdered in Macedonia, leaving the satrap of Egypt absolutely his own master. The peace did not last long, and in 309 Ptol
2 CONC emy personally commanded a fleet that detached the coastal towns of Lycia and Caria from Antigonus, then crossed into Greece, where he took possession of Corinth, Sicyon and Megara (308 BC). In 306, a
2 CONC  great fleet under Demetrius attacked Cyprus, and Ptolemy's brother Menelaus was defeated and captured in another decisive Battle of Salamis. Ptolemy's complete loss of Cyprus followed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The satraps Antigonus and Demetrius now each assumed the title of king; Ptolemy, as well as Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus I Nicator, responded by doing the same. In the winter of 306 BC, Antig
2 CONC onus tried to follow up his victory in Cyprus by invading Egypt; but Ptolemy was strongest there, and successfully held the frontier against him. Ptolemy led no further overseas expeditions against An
2 CONC tigonus. However, he did send great assistance to Rhodes when it was besieged by Demetrius (305/304),. Once rescued, the Rhodians instituted a festival to worship Ptolemy as Soter ("saviour").
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When the coalition against Antigonus was renewed in 302, Ptolemy joined it, and invaded Syria a third time, while Antigonus was engaged with Lysimachus in Asia Minor. On hearing a report that Antig
2 CONC onus had won a decisive victory there, he once again evacuated Syria. But when the news came that Antigonus had been defeated and slain by Lysimachus and Seleucus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301, he occ
2 CONC upied Syria a fourth time.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The other members of the coalition had assigned all Syria to Seleucus, after what they regarded as Ptolemy's desertion, and for the next hundred years, the question of the ownership of southern Syr
2 CONC ia (ie, Judea) produced recurring warfare between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic dynasties. Henceforth, Ptolemy seems to have mingled as little as possible in the rivalries between Asia Minor and Greece; 
2 CONC he lost what he held in Greece, but reconquered Cyprus in 295/294. Cyrene, after a series of rebellions, was finally subjugated about 300 and placed under his stepson Magas.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 285, Ptolemy abdicated in favour of one of his younger sons by Berenice -- Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who had been co-regent for three years. His eldest (legitimate) son, Ptolemy Ceraunus, whose m
2 CONC other, Eurydice, the daughter of Antipater, had been repudiated, fled to the court of Lysimachus. Ptolemy I Soter died in 283 at the age of 84. Shrewd and cautious, he had a compact and well-ordered r
2 CONC ealm to show at the end of forty years of war. His reputation for bonhomie and liberality attached the floating soldier-class of Macedonians and Greeks to his service, and was not insignificant; nor d
2 CONC id he wholly neglect conciliation of the natives. He was a ready patron of letters, founding the Great Library of Alexandria. He himself wrote a history of Alexander's campaigns that has not survived.
2 CONC  This used to be considered an objective work, distinguished by its straightforward honesty and sobriety. However, Ptolemy is considered to have exaggerated his own role, and to have had propagandist 
2 CONC aims in writing his History. Although now lost, it was a principal source for the surviving account by Arrian of Nicomedia.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Philip (Greek: Φίλιππος, died about 318 BC) was a Greek Macedonian nobleman that lived in the 4th century BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Philip was the son of Amyntas by an unnamed mother. He served as a military officer in the service of the Greek King Alexander the Great. Philip was known in commanding one division of the Phalanx 
2 CONC in Alexander’s wars and commanded one of the divisions of the Phalanx at the Battle of the Granicus in May 334 BC. His name doesn’t subsequently appear in the campaigns of Alexander, but can be at
2 CONC  least distinctly identified.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Based on the implying of Plutarch (Pyrrhus 4.4), before Philip married Berenice he was previously married and had children, including daughters born to him. The identities of his former wife and ch
2 CONC ildren are unknown.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In c.325 BC, Philip married Berenice I as her first husband.[6] Pausanias (1.7.1), criticises his marriage to Berenice I and describes him as ‘a Macedonian but of no note and of lowly origin’. 
2 CONC The ancient sources don’t say anything else about him and there is no evidence against this. Philip must have been a nobleman of some social status and influence as he married the great-niece of the
2 CONC  powerful Regent Antipater and the grandchild of Antipater’s brother Cassander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Berenice bore Philip three children:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p># Son, Magas</p>
2 CONT <p># Daughter, Antigone</p>
2 CONT <p># Daughter, Theoxena</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Philip had died of unknown causes. After his death, Berenice and their children travelled to Egypt, where they were a part of the entourage of Berenice’s second maternal cousin Eurydice. Eurydice
2 CONC  was then the wife of Ptolemy I Soter. By 317 BC, Berenice married Ptolemy I and became the Queen mother of the Ptolemaic dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a posthumous honor to Philip; his son Magas when he served as a Priest of the Greek God Apollo, had dedicated an honorific inscription proudly naming him as the ‘the eponymous priest’ and ��
2 CONC �Magas son of Philip’.

2 CONT <p>Antiokos I Soter (gresk: ??t????? ?' S?t??, «Antiokos Befrieren»; født ukjent - død 261 f.Kr.) var den andre kongen av det hellenistiske Selevkideriket. Han styrte fra 281 f.Kr. ved sin fars d�
2 CONC �d og fram til 261 f.Kr.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Han var selv halvt persisk, hans mor Apama var en av de østlige prinsesser som Aleksander den store hadde gitt som hustruer til sine hærførere i 324 f.Kr.[1] I 294 f.Kr., før hans far Ptolemaio
2 CONC s I Soter var død, hadde Antiokos giftet sin stemor, Stratonike av Syria,[2] datter av Demetrios I Poliorketes. Hans aldrende far skal etter sigende ha tilskyndet ekteskapet etter at han oppdaget at 
2 CONC hans sønn var i fare for å forgå av forelskelse. Stratonike fødte ham fem barn: Seleukos (som ble henrettet for opprør), Laodike, Apama II, Stratonike av Makedonia og Antiokos II Theos som etterf
2 CONC ulgte sin far som konge.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Da hans far ble myrdet i 281 f.Kr. havnet store oppgaven med å holde Selevkideriket sammen på Antiokos. Et opprør i Syria brøt ut nesten umiddelbart. Antiokos var snart tvunget til å slutte fr
2 CONC ed med farens morder, Ptolemaios Keraunos, samtidig som han tydeligvis oppga Makedonia og Trakia. I Anatolia klarte han ikke å bekjempe Bitynia eller de persiske dynastiene som styrte i Kappadokia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I 278 f.Kr. brøt keltisktalende folk inn i Anatolia og slo seg ned i Galatia. En seier som Antiokos vant over disse ved å benytte indiske krigselefanter i 275 f.Kr. skal etter sigende være oppri
2 CONC nnelsen til hans tittel som Soter (gresk for «Befrier» eller «Frelser»). Mot slutten av det samme året førte spørsmålet om Koilesyria, som hadde vært åpent mellom selevkidedynastiet og ptole
2 CONC meerdynastiet i Egypt siden 301 f.Kr., til åpen fiendskap i form av den første syriske krig. Koilesyria hadde jevnlig vært okkupert av Egypt, men Selevkideriket hadde opprettholdt sitt krav på omr
2 CONC ådet. Krigen endret ikke grensene mellom de to rikene i større grad, men grensebyer som Damaskus og kystdistriktene i Anatolia skiftet eier.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den 27. mars 268 f.Kr. la Antiokos grunnleggelsen for Ezidatempelet i Borsippa.[3] Hans eldste sønn Seleukos hadde styrt i øst som visekonge fra kanskje 275 f.Kr. og fram til 268/267 f.Kr. Han bl
2 CONC e nødt å henrette sønnen det sistnevnte året, anklaget for opprør. En gang rundt 262 f.Kr. forsøkte Antiokos å bryte den voksende makten til Pergamon med våpenmakt, men gikk på et nederlag ve
2 CONC d Sardis og døde kort tid etterpå. Han ble etterfulgt i 261 f.Kr. av hans andre sønn Antiokos II Theos.[4

2 CONC g of lovesickness. Stratonice bore five children to Antiochus: Seleucus (he was executed for rebellion), Laodice, Apama II, Stratonice of Macedon and Antiochus II Theos, who succeeded his father as ki
2 CONC ng.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the assassination of his father in 281 BC, the task of holding together the empire was a formidable one. A revolt in Syria broke out almost immediately. Antiochus was soon compelled to make peac
2 CONC e with his father's murderer, Ptolemy Keraunos, apparently abandoning Macedonia and Thrace. In Anatolia he was unable to reduce Bithynia or the Persian dynasties that ruled in Cappadocia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 278 BC the Gauls broke into Anatolia, and a victory that Antiochus won over these Gauls by using Indian war elephants (275 BC) is said to have been the origin of his title of Soter (Gr. for "sav
2 CONC iour").
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the end of 275 BC the question of Coele-Syria, which had been open between the houses of Seleucus and Ptolemy since the partition of 301 BC, led to hostilities (the First Syrian War). It had bee
2 CONC n continuously in Ptolemaic occupation, but the house of Seleucus maintained its claim. War did not materially change the outlines of the two kingdoms, though frontier cities like Damascus and the coa
2 CONC st districts of Asia Minor might change hands.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On March 27 268 BC Antiochus I laid the foundation for the Ezida Temple in Borsippa. His eldest son Seleucus had ruled in the east as viceroy from 275 BC(?) till 268/267 BC; Antiochus put his son t
2 CONC o death in the latter year on the charge of rebellion. Circa 262 BC Antiochus tried to break the growing power of Pergamum by force of arms, but suffered defeat near Sardis and died soon afterwards. H
2 CONC e was succeeded in 261 BC by his second son Antiochus II Theos.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Stratonice (in Greek Στρατoνίκη της Συρίας) of Syria was the daughter of king Demetrius Poliorcetes and Phila, the daughter of Antipater. In 300 BC, at which time she could not ha
2 CONC ve been more than seventeen years of age, her hand was solicited by Seleucus, king of Syria, and she was conducted by her father Demetrius to Rhosus, on the Pierian coast (in Macedonia), where her nup
2 CONC tials were celebrated with the utmost magnificence.[1] Notwithstanding the disparity of their ages, she appears to have lived in perfect harmony with the old king for some years, and had already borne
2 CONC  him one child, a daughter called Phila, when it was discovered that her stepson Antiochus was deeply enamoured of her, and Seleucus, in order to save the life of his son, which was endangered by the 
2 CONC violence of his passion, in 294 BC gave up Stratonice in marriage to the young prince, whom he at the same time constituted king of the eastern provinces.[2] The union seems to have been a prosperous 
2 CONC one, but we find little subsequent mention of Stratonice. She bore five children to Antiochus: Seleucus (he was executed for rebellion), Laodice, Apama II, Stratonice of Macedon and Antiochus II Theos
2 CONC , who succeeded his father as king. The city of Stratonikeia in Caria was named after her by Antiochus.[3] [1]

2 CONT <p>Stratonice (Greek: Στρατoνίκη) of Syria was the daughter of king Demetrius Poliorcetes and Phila, the daughter of Antipater. In 300 BC, at which time she could not have been more than seve
2 CONC nteen years of age, her hand was solicited by Seleucus, king of Syria, and she was conducted by her father Demetrius to Rhosus, on the Pierian coast (in Macedonia), where her nuptials were celebrated 
2 CONC with the utmost magnificence. Notwithstanding the disparity of their ages, she appears to have lived in perfect harmony with the old king for some years, and had already borne him one child, a daughte

2 CONC in 294 BC gave up Stratonice in marriage to the young prince, whom he at the same time constituted king of the eastern provinces. The union seems to have been a prosperous one, but we find little subs

2 CONT <p>Mithridates I Ctistes (in Greek Mιθριδάτης Kτίστης; reigned 281–266 BCE), also known as Mithridates III of Cius, was a Persian nobleman and the founder (this is the meaning of the 
2 CONC word Ctistes, literally Builder) of the Kingdom of Pontus in Anatolia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates is said to have been of the same age as Demetrios Poliorketes, which means he was born in the mid-330s BCE. In 302 or 301 BC, shortly after having executed the young man's father and pr
2 CONC edecessor Mithridates II of Cius, the diadoch Antigonus became suspicious of the son who had inherited the family dominion of Cius, and planned to kill the boy. Mithridates, however, received from Dem
2 CONC etrius Poliorketes timely notice of Antigonus's intentions, and fled with a few followers to Paphlagonia, where he occupied a strong fortress, called Cimiata. He was joined by numerous bodies of troop
2 CONC s from different quarters and gradually extended his dominions in Pontus and created the foundations for the birth of a new kingdom, which may be judged to have risen about 281 BCE when Mithridates as
2 CONC sumed the title of basileus (king). In the same year, we find him concluding an alliance with the town of Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia, to protect it against Seleucus[5]. At a subsequent period, Mithr
2 CONC idates is found acquiring support from the Gauls (who later settled in Asia Minor) in order to overthrow a force sent against him by Ptolemy, king of Egypt.[6] These are the recorded events of his rei
2 CONC gn, which lasted for thirty-six years. He was succeeded by his son Ariobarzanes. He seems to have been buried in a royal grave near the kingdom's capital, Amasia. Next to him would be buried all the k
2 CONC ings of Pontus until the fall of Sinope in 183 BCE.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Appian, he was eighth in descent from the first satrap of Pontus under Darius the Great and sixth in ascending order from Mithridates Eupator. However, this point is controversial sinc
2 CONC e Plutarch[9] writes that eight generations of kings of Pontus stemmed from him before Roman subjection.

2 CONT <p>Pontus</p>
2 CONT <p>In ancient times, Pontus was the name of the north-eastern province ofAsia Minor, a long and narrow strip of land on the southern coast of theBlack Sea (Pontus Euxinus), from which the designation 
2 CONC was latertransferred to the country. Before this the province was calledCappadocia on the Pontus. The country was shut in by high and wildmountain ranges, but was exceedingly fertile in the lower part
2 CONC s on thecoast, in the interior, and on the plateaux. It yielded fruit of allkinds, especially cherries, which Lucullus is said to have brought intoEurope from Pontus 72 B. C.; also wine, grain, wood, 
2 CONC honey, wax, etc.,besides iron, steel, and salt. It was inhabited by a number of pettytribes; among these were the Chalybes or Chaldæans, held in high reputeby the Greeks as the first smiths. All belo
2 CONC nged to the Persian empire,but in Xenophon's day (about 400 B. C.) were to a considerable degreeindependent of the Persians. At this date, however, these differentcountries had no common name. Greeks 
2 CONC settled early on the coast, andfounded flourishing commercial cities, as Trapezus (Trebizond), Cerasus,Side, later called Polemonium, Cotyora, Amisus, and Apsarus. The founderof the Kingdom of Pontus 
2 CONC was Mithradates I, son of Prince Mithradates ofCius on the Propontis, who was murdered 302 B. C. Mithradates I, takingadvantage of the confusion caused by the Diadochian Wars, came to Pontuswith only 
2 CONC six horsemen and was able to assume the title of king 296 B.C.; he died in 266 after a reign of thirty-six years. He was followed byAriobarzanes (died about 258 B. C.), Mithradates II (to about 210 B.
2 CONC  C.),Mithradates III (to about 190 B. C.), Pharnaces (to 170 B. C.),Mithradates IV (to about 150 B. C.), Mithradates V (to 121 B. C.), andthen Mithradates VI Eupator, or the Great. The kings, Persian 
2 CONC by descent,formed relations early with Greece and from the beginning Hellenisticculture found an entrance into Pontus. The religion was a mixture ofGreek worships with the old native cults. From the t
2 CONC ime of Pharnaces thekings were allied with the Romans. Mithradates VI became involved inthree wars with the Romans (88-84, 83-81, 74-64), and finally hiskingdom, which he had increased by the conquest
2 CONC  of Colchis, the Crimea,Paphlagonia, and Cappadocia, was lost to the Romans (63). The territorywest of the River Halys, the coast of Paphlagonia, and the valley of theAmnias became a part of Roman ter
2 CONC ritory and with Bithynia were unitedinto the double Province of Bithynia and Pontus. The other parts weremade into principalities and free cities, and it was not until 7 B.C., AD. 18, and A.D. 63 that
2 CONC  they were gradually absorbed by Rome. UnderDiocletian (284-305) Pontus became a diocese of the empire. The Pontusmentioned in the Old Testament of the Vulgate in Gen., xiv, 1, 9, is amistaken transla
2 CONC tion, according to Symmachus, for the district of Ellasar(Larsa in southern Babylonia).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Apostolic times Christianity found an entrance into Pontus. The FirstEpistle of Peter is addressed to the Christians in Pontus among others,showing that Christianity had spread to some extent in
2 CONC  this province. Theauthor in his exhortations presupposes relations between the faithful andthe non-Christian population. For the years 111-13 we have the importanttestimony of Pliny, then Governor of
2 CONC  Bithynia and Pontus (Ep. xcvi).Pliny did not mention the cities or villages, and it is uncertain whetherAmastris, or Amasia, or Comana, was the place where Christians were triedby him. As concerns Am
2 CONC isus, Ramsay has proved from Christian sources thatit contained Christians about the year 100. Later Amastris was the chiefChristian community. Eusebius mentions (IV, xxiii) a letter written byBishop 
2 CONC Dionysius of Corinth (about 170) to Amastris, "and the otherchurches in Pontus". There was, therefore, at this era a metropolitanwith several churches. About 240 Gregory Thaumaturgus was consecratedBi
2 CONC shop of Neo-Cæsarea by Phædimus, Bishop of Amasia. It is said that atthat time there were only seventeen Christians in the city and itsvicinity, and that at his death, shortly before 270, only the s
2 CONC ame numberof heathens could be found in the city. The able bishop converted thepeople by opposing Christian to heathen miracles and by changing the oldfeasts into Christian festivals. In the Decian pe
2 CONC rsecution he madeconcessions to human weakness, advised the faithful to be lessaggressive, and fled himself. Comana received a bishop from Gregory.Christianity obtained a foothold also in the Greek ci
2 CONC ties of the coast ofeastern Pontus before 325. In or about the year 315 a great synod washeld at Neo-Cæsarea by Bishop Longinus. At the Council of Nicæa therewere present among others the Bishops of
2 CONC  Amastris, Pompejopolis,Jonopolis, Amasia, Comana, Zela, Trebizond, and Pityus. Towards the endof the fourth century Neo-Cæsarea became itself a Church-province, havingas suffragans Trebizond, Cerasu
2 CONC s, Polemonium, Comana, Rhizæum, and Pityus.

2 CONT <p>parthia.com : Fifth king of Parthia, and the king who established Parthia as an ancient world power. He was the brother of Phraates I, and the son of Phriapatius. He was the father of Phraates II.
2 CONT <p>We do not know the exact date of his accession, but he is mentioned by Justin [XLI.6] as a contemporary of Bactria's Eucratides and Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Antiochus IV campaigned in Iran to return
2 CONC  the territories lost by Arsaces II.
2 CONT <p>Mithradates I may have campaigned into Tapuria and Traxiana shortly after succeeding to the throne. The death of Antiochus IV in 164 B.C. would certainly have reduced pressure on Parthia from the w
2 CONC est. From 161 - 155 B.C. Mithradates waged a long war with Media, the success of which was long unsure. The best account appears to be that Timarkhos, Seleucid satrap of Media lost some territory in t
2 CONC he area of Rhagae and farther east, to Mithradates I, while the Seleucid reconquest did not recover this land but did recapture Ecbatana. According to Justin,1  Mithradates I had to fight many times i
2 CONC n Media and Frye2  believes it conceivable that the Seleucids held only the city and the lowlands to the west of Ecbatana at the time the relief at Herakles was carved, approximately 148 B.C.
2 CONT <p>The acquisition of Media opened the door to Mesopotamia for Parthian expansion into that fertile territory.3  Mithradates entered the royal city of Seleucia and was recognized as King on or before 
2 CONC July 8, 141 B.C. Before October 141 B.C., Mithradates sovereignty was acknowledged as far south as Uruk. But by December, incursions of the  Sakae into Hyrcania forced him away to the east. Mithradate
2 CONC s turned over military command to a Parthian commander and the remainder of his reign was occupied with campaigns in southern and central Parthia.4  Mithradates was no sooner gone than Demetrius retur
2 CONC ned to the attack, joined by Elymais and Persis (and perhaps Bactrian troops), but Demetrius was soon captured and sent to Mithradates in Hyrcania. He was well treated, however, and given Rhodogune, M
2 CONC ithradates' daughter, in marriage. As punishment for joining Demetrius against the Parthians, Elymais was looted, where the temples of Artemis and Athena yielded "ten thousand talents."5  Since the Pa
2 CONC rthians were established at Susa shortly after the death of Mithradates, that territory was probably added to the empire by him.6  At his death, the Parthian empire included Parthia proper, Hyrcania, 
2 CONC Media, Babylonia, Assyria, Elymais, Persis (?), and the districts of Tapuria and Traxiana.
2 CONT <p>Scholars originally accepted Mithradates I died peacefully in 138/137 B.C., a date fixed by the date of his final tetradrachm (S13.5, dated 174 Seleucid era), and cuneiform evidence, but recent wor
2 CONC ks by Dabrowa8 and others suggest the end of Mithradates I's reign was in 132 B.C.

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates of Cius (in Greek M????d?t?? or M???ad?t??; lived c. 386–302 BC, ruled 337–302 BC) succeeded his father Ariobarzanes II in 337 BC as ruler of the Greek town of Cius in Mysia (today 
2 CONC part of Turkey).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Diodorus assigns him a rule of thirty-five years, but it appears that he did not hold uninterrupted possession of the sovereignty during that period1. What circumstances led to his expulsion or sub
2 CONC jection we know not; nothing is heard of him till his death in 302, but it appears that he had submitted to the Macedonian Antigonus, who now, to prevent him from joining the league of Cassander and h
2 CONC is confederates, procured his assassination in Cius.2 According to Lucian3, he was not less than eighty-four years of age at the time of his death, which renders it not improbable that he is the same 
2 CONC as the Mithridates, son of Ariobarzanes, who in his youth circumvented and put to death Datames.

2 CONT <p>Agathocles of Pella</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Agathocles (Greek: Ἀγαθοκλῆς, flourished 4th century BC) was a Greek nobleman who was a contemporary to King Philip II of Macedon (reigned 359 BC–336 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Agathocles was a Thessalian serf[1] from Crannon.[2][3] His father’s name may have been Alcimachus. It was through his flattery that Agathocles became an intimate friend of Philip II,[1] who rais
2 CONC ed him to high rank.[4] Agathocles was granted Macedonian citizenship for himself and his family.[2] Agathocles shared in Philip II’s councils and Phillip II sent him to deal with the Perrhaebi and 
2 CONC Agathocles took charge of affairs in that area.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There is a possibility that Phillip II rewarded Agathocles for his services with estates in Pella.[1] Agathocles became a favorite in the Argead court in Pella and his family assimilated into Maced
2 CONC onian society.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Agathocles married an unnamed Greek woman, a local Thessalian, perhaps a woman called Arsinoe. With his wife they had four sons:

2 CONT <p>Antipater (Greek: Ἀντίπατρος Antipatros; ca. 397 BC — 319 BC) was a Macedonian general and a supporter of kings Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great. In 320 BC, he became regen

2 CONT <p>Antipater (c. 399-319 B.C.) was an advisor of Alexander and commander of Alexander's European forces who served as regent from 334-323 B.C.

2 CONT <p>Antipater and Parmenion were instrumental in making Alexander leader of the Macedonians after his father Philip died.

2 CONT <p>Antipater and Alexander's mother Olympias quarreled, as a result of which Olympias wrote repeatedly to Alexander. Eventually, in 324, Alexander ordered Antipater to Babylon, but he was unable to co
2 CONC mply and sent his son Cassander, instead. Alexander interpreted this badly, but died before he might have had Antipater killed. Cassander was rumored to have poisoned Alexander.

2 CONT <p>Antipater controlled Macedonia following Alexander's death. Before Antipater died, he appointed Polyperchon as his successor, with his son Cassander as second in command, or chiliarch. Cassander wa

2 CONT <p>Antipater (/ænˈtɪpətər/; Greek: Ἀντίπατρος Antipatros; c. 397 BC-319 BC) was a Macedonian general and a supporter of kings Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great. In 320 BC, h
2 CONC e became regent of all of Alexander's Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Career under Philip and Alexander'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nothing is known of his early career until 342 BC, when he was appointed by Philip to govern Macedon as his regent while the former left for three years of hard and successful campaigning against T
2 CONC hracian and Scythians tribes, which extended Macedonian rule as far as the Hellespont. In 342 BC, when the Athenians tried to assume control of the Euboean towns and expel the pro-Macedonian rulers, h
2 CONC e sent Macedonian troops to stop them. In the autumn of the same year, Antipater went to Delphi, as Philip's representative in the Amphictyonic League, a religious organization to which Macedon had be
2 CONC en admitted in 346 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the triumphal Macedonian victory at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, Antipater was sent as ambassador to Athens (337–336 BC) to negotiate a peace treaty and return the bones of the Atheni
2 CONC ans who had fallen in the battle.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He started as a great friend to both the young Alexander and the boy's mother, Olympias; there were even rumours that he was Alexander's father. He aided Alexander in the struggle to secure his suc
2 CONC cession after Philip's death, in 336 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He joined Parmenion in advising Alexander the Great not to set out on his Asiatic expedition until he had provided by marriage for the succession to the throne. On the king's departure in 334 BC, h
2 CONC e was left regent in Macedonia and made "general (strategos) of Europe", positions he held until 323 BC. The European front was to prove initially quite agitated, and Antipater also had to send reinfo
2 CONC rcements to the king, as he did while the king was at Gordium in the winter of 334–333 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Persian fleet under Memnon of Rhodes and Pharnabazus was apparently a considerable danger for Antipater, bringing war in the Aegean sea and threatening war in Europe. Luckily for the regent, Me
2 CONC mnon died during the siege of Mytilene on the isle of Lesbos and the remaining fleet dispersed in 333 BC, after Alexander's victory at the Battle of Issus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>More dangerous enemies were nearer home; tribes in Thrace rebelled in 332 BC, led by Memnon of Thrace, the Macedonian governor of the region, followed shortly by the revolt of Agis III, king of Spa
2 CONC rta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Spartans, who were not members of the League of Corinth and had not participated in Alexander's expedition, saw in the Asian campaign the long-awaited chance to take back control over the Pelop
2 CONC onnese after the disastrous defeats at the Battle of Leuctra and Battle of Mantinea. The Persians generously funded Sparta's ambitions, making possible the formation of an army 20,000 strong. After as
2 CONC suming virtual control of Crete, Agis tried to build an anti-Macedonian front. While Athens remained neutral, the Achaeans, Arcadians and Elis became his allies, with the important exception of Megalo
2 CONC polis, the staunchly anti-Spartan capital of Arcadia. Agis started in 331 BC to besiege the city with his entire army, generating great alarm in Macedon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>So to not have two enemies simultaneously, Antipater pardoned Memnon and even let him keep his office in Thrace, while great sums of money were sent him by Alexander. This helped to create, with Th
2 CONC essalian help and many mercenaries, a force double that of Agis, which Antipater in person led south in 330 BC to confront the Spartans. In the spring of that year, the two armies clashed near Megalop
2 CONC olis. Agis fell with many of his best soldiers, but not without inflicting heavy losses on the Macedonians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Utterly defeated, the Spartans sued for peace; the latter's answer was to negotiate directly with the League of Corinth, but the Spartan emissaries preferred to treat directly with Alexander, who i
2 CONC mposed on Sparta's allies a penalty of 120 talents and the entrance of Sparta in the league.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Alexander appears to have been quite jealous of Antipater's victory; according to Plutarch, the king wrote in a letter to his viceroy: "It seems, my friends that while we have been conquering Dariu
2 CONC s here, there has been a battle of mice in Arcadia".
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antipater was disliked for supporting oligarchs and tyrants in Greece, but he also worked with the League of Corinth, built by Philip. In addition, his previously close relationship with the ambiti
2 CONC ous Olympias greatly deteriorated. Whether from jealousy or from the necessity of guarding against the evil consequences of the dissension between Olympias and Antipater, in 324 BC, Alexander ordered 
2 CONC the latter to lead fresh troops into Asia, while Craterus, in charge of discharged veterans returning home, was appointed to take over the regency in Macedon. When Alexander suddenly died in Babylon i
2 CONC n 323 BC however, Antipater was able to forestall the transfer of power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''The fight for succession'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The new regent, Perdiccas, left Antipater in control of Greece. Antipater faced revolts in Athens, Aetolia, and Thessaly that made up the Lamian War, in which southern Greeks attempted to re-assert
2 CONC  their independence. He defeated them at the Battle of Crannon in 322 BC, with Craterus' help, and broke up the rebellion. As part of this he imposed oligarchy upon Athens and demanded the surrender o
2 CONC f Demosthenes, who committed suicide to escape capture. Later in the same year Antipater and Craterus were engaged in a war against the Aetolians when he received the news from Antigonus in Asia Minor
2 CONC  that Perdiccas contemplated making himself outright ruler of the empire. Antipater and Craterus accordingly conclude peace with the Aetolians and went to war against Perdiccas, allying themselves wit
2 CONC h Ptolemy, the satrap of Egypt. Antipater crossed over to Asia in 321 BC. While still in Syria, he received information that Perdiccas had been murdered by his own soldiers. Craterus fell in battle ag
2 CONC ainst Eumenes (Diodorus xviii. 25-39).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Regent of the Empire'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the treaty of Triparadisus (321 BC) Antipater participated in a new division of Alexander's great kingdom. He appointed himself supreme regent of all Alexander's empire and was left in control o
2 CONC f Greece as guardian of Alexander's son Alexander IV and his disabled brother Philip III. Having quelled a mutiny of his troops and commissioned Antigonus to continue the war against Eumenes and the o
2 CONC ther partisans of Perdiccas, Antipater returned to Macedonia, arriving there in 320 BC (Justin xiii. 6). Soon after, he was seized by an illness which terminated his active career, and died, leaving t
2 CONC he regency to the aged Polyperchon, passing over his son Cassander, a measure which gave rise to much confusion and ill-feeling.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antipater was one of the sons of a Macedonian nobleman called Iollas or Iolaus and his family were distant collateral relatives to the Argead dynasty. Antipater was originally from the Macedonian c
2 CONC ity of Paliura; had a brother called Cassander; was the paternal uncle of Cassander’s child Antigone and was the maternal great uncle of Berenice I of Egypt. Antipater had ten children from various 
2 CONC unknown wives. His daughters were: Phila, Eurydice of Egypt and Nicaea of Macedon, while his sons were: Iollas, Cassander, Pleistarchus, Phillip, Nicanor, Alexarchus and Triparadeisus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Literary works'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antipater was a student of Aristotle and Aristotle named him as executor-in-charge of his will, when he died in 322 BC. According to Suidas, Antipater left a compilation of letters in 2 books and a
2 CONC  history, called The Illyrian Deeds of Perdikkas (Περδίκκου πράξεις Ιλλυριακαί).

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Though the debate surrounding the cause of Alexander's sudden death has never been clearly resolved, all of our ancient sources—even those who reject the notion of murder and assign the death to 
2 CONC natural causes—mention that rumours abounded in the late fourth century BC that Antipater had been responsible for poisoning the great king. Shortly before Alexander's demise, Antipater's position h
2 CONC ad recently come under threat, as Alexander's mother Olympias had been writing to her son that Antipater was fomenting unrest and disloyalty in Macedon. Alexander had summoned him to Babylon to answer
2 CONC  these charges, but, citing his fear of an uprising in Greece, he had sent his son Cassander in his place. Cassander—so the rumour goes—then had his younger brother Iollas, Alexander's butler, poi
2 CONC son the king. Plutarch, who does not believe that Alexander was murdered, cites as the authority behind these rumours one Hagnothemis, who overheard Antigonus discuss the matter.

2 CONT <p>Arsinoe of Macedonia (Greek: Ἀρσινόη; lived 4th century BC) was the mother of Ptolemy I Soter (323 BC – 283 BC), king of Egypt. She was originally a concubine of Philip II, king of Macedo

2 CONT <p>Ptolemy was the son of the nobleman Lagus, a native of the Macedonian district of Eordaea whose family was undistinguished until Ptolemy’s time, and of Arsinoe, who was related to the Macedonian

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} '''Seleucus I''' (given the surname by later generations of Nicator, Greek : Σέλευκος Νικάτωρ, i.e. Seleucus the Victor) (ca. 358 BC – 281 BC) was a leading officer of
2 CONC  Alexander the Great's League of Corinth and one of the Diadochi. In the Wars of the Diadochi that took place after Alexander's death, Seleucus established the Seleucid dynasty and the Seleucid Empire
2 CONC . His kingdom would be one of the last holdouts of Alexander's former empire to Roman rule. They were only outlived by the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt by roughly 34 years.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Alexander, Seleucus was nominated as the satrap of Babylon in 320 BC. Antigonus forced Seleucus to flee from Babylon, but, supported by Ptolemy, he was able to return in 312 BC. 
2 CONC Seleucus' later conquests include Persia and Media. It is assumed that he was defeated by the emperor of India, Chandragupta Maurya and accepted a matrimony alliance for 500 elephants after ceding the
2 CONC  territories considered as part of India. Seleucus defeated Antigonus in the battle of Ipsus in 301 BC and Lysimachus in the battle of Corupedium in 281 BC. He was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus dur
2 CONC ing the same year. His successor was his son Antiochus I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus founded a number of new cities, including Antioch and Seleucia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was the son of Antiochus from Orestis. Historian Junianus Justinus claims he was one of Philip II of Macedon's generals. Antiochus is not, however, mentioned in any other sources and nothi
2 CONC ng is known of his supposed career under Philip. It is possible that Antiochus was a member of an upper Macedonian noble family. Seleucus' mother was supposedly called Laodice, but nothing else is kno
2 CONC wn of her. Later, Seleucus named a number of cities after his parents.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a teenager, Seleucus was chosen to serve as the king's page (paides). It was customary for all male offspring of noble families to first serve in this position and later as officers in the king'
2 CONC s army.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus' year of birth is unclear. Justin claims he was 77 years old during the battle of Corupedium, which would place his year of birth at 358 BC. Appianus tells us Seleucus was 73 years old dur
2 CONC ing the battle, which means 354 BC would be the year of birth. Eusebius of Caesarea, however, mentions the age of 75, and thus the year 356 BC, making Seleucus the same age as Alexander the Great. Thi
2 CONC s is most likely propaganda on Seleucus' part to make him seem comparable to Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was born in Europos, located in the northern part of Macedonia. Just a year before his birth (if the year 358 BC is accepted as the most likely date), the Paeonians invaded the region. Phi
2 CONC lip defeated the invaders and only a few years later utterly subdued them under Macedonian rule.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A number of legends, similar to those told of Alexander the Great, were told of Seleucus. It was said Antiochus told his son before he left to battle the Persians with Alexander that his real fathe
2 CONC r was actually the god Apollo. The god had left a ring with a picture of an anchor as a gift to Laodice. Seleucus had a birthmark shaped like an anchor. It was told that Seleucus' sons and grandsons a
2 CONC lso had similar birthmarks. The story is similar to the one told about Alexander. Most likely the story is merely propaganda by Seleucus, who presumably invented the story to present himself as the na
2 CONC tural successor of Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>John Malalas tells us Seleucus had a sister called Didymeia, who had sons called Nicanor and Nicomedes. It is most likely the sons are fictitious. Didymeia might refer to the oracle of Apollo in Di
2 CONC dyma near Miletus. It has also been suggested that Ptolemy (son of Seleucus) was actually the uncle of Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>===Early career under Alexander the Great===</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In spring 334 BC, as a young man of about twenty-three, Seleucus accompanied Alexander into Asia. By the time of the Indian campaigns beginning in late in 327 BC, he had risen to the command of the
2 CONC  élite infantry corps in the Macedonian army, the "Shield-bearers" (Hypaspistai), later known as the "Silvershields". It is said that when Alexander crossed the Hydaspes river on a boat, he was accom
2 CONC panied by Perdiccas, Ptolemy I Soter, Lysimachus and also Seleucus. During the subsequent Battle of the Hydaspes River, Seleucus led his troops against the elephants of King Porus. It is likely that S
2 CONC eleucus had no role in the actual planning of the battle. He is also not mentioned as holding any major independent position during the battle, unlike, for example, Craterus, Hephaistion, Peithon and 
2 CONC Leonnatus – each of whom had sizable detachments under his control. Seleucus' Royal Hypaspistai were constantly under Alexander's eye and at his disposal. They later participated in the Indus valley
2 CONC  campaign, in the battles fought against the Malli and in the crossing of the Gedrosian desert.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus also took his future wife, the Persian princess Apama (daughter of Spitamenes), with him into India as his mistress, where she gave birth to his bastard[citation needed] eldest son and suc
2 CONC cessor Antiochus I Soter (325 BC). At the great marriage ceremony at Susa in the spring of 324 BC, Seleucus formally married Apama, and she later bore him at least two legitimate daughters, Laodice, A
2 CONC pama and a son Achaeus. At the same event, Alexander married the daughter of Darius III while several other Macedonians married Persian women. After Alexander's death, when the other senior Macedonian
2 CONC  officers unloaded their "Susa wives" en masse, Seleucus was one of the very few who kept his, and Apama remained his consort and later Queen for the rest of her life.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus is mentioned three times in ancient sources before the death of Alexander. He participated in a sailing trip near Babylon, took part in the dinner party of Medeios the Thessalian with Alex
2 CONC ander and visited the temple of Sarapis. In the first of these episodes, Alexander's diadem was blown off his head and landed on some reeds near the tombs of Assyrian kings. Seleucus swam to fetch the
2 CONC  diadem back, placing it on his own head while returning to the boat to keep it dry. The validity of the story is dubious. The story of the dinner party of Medeios may be true, but the plot to poison 
2 CONC the King is unlikely.In the final story, Seleucus reportedly slept in the temple of Sarapis in the hope that Alexander's health might improve. The validity of this story is also questionable.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>===Senior officer under Perdiccas===</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Alexander the Great died without a successor in Babylon on June 10, 323 BC. His general Perdiccas became the regent of all of Alexander's empire, while Alexander's physically and mentally disabled 
2 CONC half-brother Arrhidaeus was chosen as the next king under the name Philip III of Macedon. Alexander's unborn child (Alexander IV) was also named his father's successor. In the "Partition of Babylon" h
2 CONC owever, Perdiccas effectively divided the enormous Macedonian dominion among Alexander's generals. Seleucus was chosen to command the Companion cavalry (hetaroi) and appointed first or court chiliarch
2 CONC , which made him the senior officer in the Royal Army after the regent and commander-in-chief Perdiccas. Several other powerful men supported Perdiccas, including Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Peithon and Eume
2 CONC nes. Perdiccas' power depended on his ability to hold Alexander's enormous empire together, and on whether he could force the satraps to obey him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>War soon broke out between Perdiccas and the other Diadochi. To cement his position, Perdiccas tried to marry Alexander's sister Cleopatra. The First War of the Diadochi began when Perdiccas sent A
2 CONC lexander's corpse to Macedonia for burial. Ptolemy however captured the body and took it to Alexandria. Perdiccas and his troops followed him to Egypt, whereupon Ptolemy conspired with the satrap of M
2 CONC edia, Peithon, and the commander of the Argyraspides, Antigenes, both serving as officers under Perdiccas, and assassinated him. Cornelius Nepos mentions that Seleucus also took part in this conspirac
2 CONC y, but this is not certain.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>===Satrap of Babylon===</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most powerful man in the empire after the death of Perdiccas was Antipater. Perdiccas' opponents gathered in Triparadisos, where the empire of Alexander was partitioned again (the Treaty of Tri
2 CONC paradisus 321 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At Triparadisos the soldiers had become mutinous and were planning to murder their master Antipater. Seleucus and Antigonus, however, managed to prevent this. For betraying Perdiccas, Seleucus was 
2 CONC awarded the rich province of Babylon. This decision may have been Antigonus' idea. Seleucus' Babylon was surrounded by Peucestas, the satrap of Persis; Antigenes, the new satrap of Susiana and Peithon
2 CONC  of Media. Babylon was one of the wealthiest provinces of the empire, but its military power was insignificant. It is possible that Antipater divided the eastern provinces so that no single satrap cou
2 CONC ld rise above the others in power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Alexander, Archon of Pella was chosen satrap of Babylon. Perdiccas, however, had had plans to supersede Archon and nominate Docimus as his successor. During his invasion of Egypt
2 CONC , Perdiccas sent Docimus along with his detachments to Babylon. Archon waged war against him, but fell in battle. Thus, Docimus was not intending to give Babylon to Seleucus without a fight. It is not
2 CONC  certain how Seleucus took Babylon from Docimus, but according to one Babylonian chronicle an important building was destroyed in the city during the summer or winter of 320 BC. Other Babylonian sourc
2 CONC es state that Seleucus arrived in Babylon in October or November 320 BC. Despite the presumed battle, Docimus was able to escape.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile, the empire was once again in turmoil. Peithon, the satrap of Media, assassinated Philip, the satrap of Parthia, and replaced him with his brother Eudemus as the new satrap. In the west A
2 CONC ntigonus and Eumenes waged war against each other. Just like Peithon and Seleucus, Eumenes was one of the former supporters of Perdiccas. Seleucus' biggest problem was, however, Babylon itself. The lo
2 CONC cals had rebelled against Archon and supported Docimus. The Babylonian priesthood had great influence over the region. Babylon also had a sizable population of Macedonian and Greek veterans of Alexand
2 CONC er's army. Seleucus managed to win over the priests with monetary gifts and bribes.

2 CONT <p>Selevkos I (gitt tilnavnet Nikator av senere generasjoner, gresk: S??e???? ????t??; Selevkos Viktor («Seierherre»); ca. 358 – 281 f.Kr.) var en ledende makedonsk hærfører og offiser av Aleksa
2 CONC nder den stores koriniske forbund og en av diadokene. I diadokenes krig, som fant sted i kjølvannet av Aleksanders død i 323 f.Kr., etablerte Selevkos sin eget dynasti, Selevkidedynastiet, og sitt e
2 CONC get rike, Selevkideriket. Hans kongedømme ble en av de siste gjenværende delene av Aleksanders tidligere veldige rike som sto imot Romerrikets ekspansjon. Det var kun det ptolemeiske kongedømme i E

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Etter Aleksanders død ble Selevkos nominert som satrap av Babylon i 320 f.Kr. Han ble tvunget av Antigonos I Monofthalmos, en av de andre diadokene, til å flykte fra byen, men med støtte fra Pto
2 CONC lemaios I Soter i Egypt var han i 312 f.Kr. i stand til å komme tilbake. Selevkos' senere erobringer omfattet Persia og Media. Han ble beseiret av keiseren av India, Chandragupta Maurya, og akseptert
2 CONC e en ekteskapsallianse for 500 elefanter etter å ha avstått områder som ble betraktet som en del av India. Selevkos beseiret Antigonos i slaget ved Ipsos i 301 f.Kr. og Lysimakhos, en annen av diad
2 CONC okene, i slaget ved Korupedion i 281 f.Kr. Han ble myrdet av Ptolemaios Keraunos, konge av Makedonia, det samme året og ble etterfulgt av sin sønn Antiokos I Soter.

2 CONT <p>Unge år og familie [rediger]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos var sønn av Antiokos.[1] Historikeren Junianus Justinus hevder at han var en av Filip II av Makedonias generaler, men Antiokos er imidlertid ikke nevnt noen annen kilde og det er ingentin
2 CONC g som er bevart om hans påståtte karriere under Filip. Det er mulig at Antiokos var et medlem av en høyere makedonske adelsfamilie. Selevkos' mor var etter signende kalt for Laodike, men ingenting 
2 CONC annet er kjent om henne. Senere kom Selevkos til å oppkalle en rekke byer etter sine foreldre. [2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Som tenåring ble Selevkos utvalgt til å tjene som kongens pasje (paides). Det var sedvane for alle mannlige avkom av adelsfamilier å først tjene i denne posisjonen og senere som offiserer i kon
2 CONC gens hær. [2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hvilket år Selevkos ble født er uklart. Junianus hevder han var 77 år gammel i slaget ved Korupedion (281 f.Kr.), hvilket ville ha betydd at han ble født i 3578 f.Kr. Appian av Alexandria forte
2 CONC ller at han var 73 år under det samme slaget, hvilket betyr at han ble født i 354 f.Kr. Imidlertid sier Eusebius av Cæsarea at han var 75 år gammel, født i 356 f.Kr., hvilket betyr at Selevkos va
2 CONC r like gammel som Aleksander den store. Det er antagelig propaganda fra Selevkos' side for å gjøre seg selv likestilt med Aleksanders berømmelse. [3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos ble født i Europos som er lokalisert i den nordlige delen av Makedonia. Kun et år før hans fødsel (om året 358 f.Kr. er akseptert som den mest sannsynlige datoen) invaderte paionerne 
2 CONC denne regionen. Filip beseiret angriperne og kun noen få år senere underkastet han dem fullstendig til makedonsk styre.[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Et antall legender, tilsvarende til de som ble fortalt om Aleksander den store, ble også fortalt om Selevkos. Det ble eksempelvis fortalt at hans far Antiokos hadde fortalt sin sønn før han dro 
2 CONC ut for å kjempe mot perserne at hans virkelig far var egentlig guden Apollon. Guden hadde etterlatt en ring med et bilde av et anker til hans mor Laodike. Selevkos hadde passende nok et fødemerke fo
2 CONC rmet som et anker. Det ble fortalt at hans sønn og sønnesønner hadde lignende fødemerker. Denne historien er lik den som ble fortalt om Aleksander. Igjen er dette mest sannsynlig propaganda som Se
2 CONC levkos fikk spredt om seg selv med den hensikt å presentere seg selv som den naturlige etterfølgeren av den store Aleksander. [2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Johannes Malalas, en gresk-bysantinsk kronikør fra Antiokia på 500-tallet, har fortalt at Selevkos hadde en søster ved navn Didymeia og som hadde sønner som ble kalt for Nikanor og Nikomedes. M
2 CONC est sannsynlig er disse sønnene fiktive. Didymeia kan derimot referere til Apollons orakel ved helligdommen Didyma i nærheten av Miletos. Det har også blitt foreslått at Ptolemaios (sønn av Selev
2 CONC kos), en av kongens livvakter, var i virkeligheten en onkel av ham. [5]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tidlig karriere under Aleksander [rediger]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos ledet de kongelige hypaspistai under Aleksanders krig i Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Våren 334 f.Kr. fulgte Selevkos, som en ung mann på rundt 23 år, Aleksander inn i Asia. Ved tidspunktet for krigstoktet inn i India sent i 327 f.Kr. hadde han fått ansvaret med å lede eliteinf
2 CONC anterikorpset i den makedonske hæren, hypaspistai, «skjoldbærerne», senere kjent som «sølvskjoldene». Det er sagt at da Aleksander krysset elven Hydaspes i en båt, ble han fulgt av Perdikkas, 
2 CONC Ptolemaios I Soter, Lysimakhos, foruten også Selevkos. I løpet av det påfølgende slaget ved Hydaspeselven, ledet Selevkos soldatene mot krigselefantene til kong Porus (Purushotthama). Det er sanns
2 CONC ynlig at Selevkos ikke hadde en aktiv rolle i dette slaget. Han er heller ikke nevnt å ha hatt noen betydelig selvstendig posisjon i løpet av slaget, i motsetningen til eksempelvis Krateros, Hefaist
2 CONC ion, Peithon, og Leonnatos, hver av dem hadde betydelig andel soldater under sin ledelse.[6] Selevkos' kongelige skjoldbærere var hele tiden i nærheten av Aleksander og til hans rådighet. De deltok
2 CONC  senere i den militære kampanjen i Indusdalen, i slagene som ble utkjempet mot det indiske folket malhierne og deltok også i kryssingen av ørkenen Gedrosia hvor Aleksander mistet minst en tredjedel
2 CONC  av sine menn.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos tok også hans framtidige hustru, den persiske prinsessen Apama (datter av Spitamenes), med seg til India som sin elskerinne. Der fødte hun hans eldste sønn og etterfølger Antiokos I So
2 CONC ter i 325 f.Kr. Ved den store bryllupsseremonien i Susa våren 324 f.Kr. giftet han seg formelt med Apama, og senere fødte hun ham minst to døtre, Laodike, Apama, og en sønn ved navn Akaios. I den 
2 CONC samme seremonien giftet Aleksander seg med datteren til Dareios III av Persia og flere andre makedonere giftet seg med persiske kvinner. Etter Aleksanders død, mens andre makedonske hærførere kvitt

2 CONT <p>Selevkos er nevnt tre ganger i antikke kilder før Aleksanders død. Han deltok på en seiltur i nærheten av Babylon, var tilstede i middagsselskap til Medeios fra Thessalia sammen med Aleksander,
2 CONC  og besøkte tempelet til den gresk-egyptiske guddommen Serapis. I den første av disse episodene blåste Aleksanders diadem av hans hode og landet på noen strå i nærhetene av gravene til de assyri
2 CONC ske kongene. Selevkos var den som svømte ut for å hendte den tilbake, og plasserte kronen på sitt eget hode mens vendte tilbake til båten for å holdet det tørt. Troverdigheten i denne fortelling
2 CONC en er tvilsom. Fortellingen om middagsselskapet kan derimot være sann, men sammensvergelsen om å forgifte kongen er ikke like troverdig og antagelig en foregripelse av Aleksanders senere død. I den
2 CONC  siste fortellingen skal Selevkos etter sigende ha sovet i tempelet til Sarapis i håp om at Aleksanders helse ville bedre seg. Heller ikke denne fortellingen er sannsynlig.[8]

2 CONT <p>Aleksander den store døde uten en etterfølger i Babylon den 10. juni 323 f.Kr. Hans general Perdikkas ble regent for hele hans store rike, mens Aleksanders noe tilbakestående halvbror Filip III 
2 CONC Arrhidaios ble valgt som den neste kongen av Makedonia. Aleksanders ufødte barn (Aleksander IV av Makedonia) ble også navngitt som sin fars etterfølger. I konferansen som kalles for delingen i Baby

2 CONC av et tusen»), noe som gjorde ham til senioroffiser for den kongelige hæren etter regenten og øverstkommanderende Perdikkas. Flere andre mektige menn støttet Perdikkas, inkludert Ptolemaios I Sote

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det brøt snart ut krig mellom Perdikkas og de andre diadokene. For å sikre sin posisjon, forsøkte Perdikkas å gifte seg med Aleksanders søster Kleopatra. Den første diadokkrigen begynte da Pe

2 CONT <p>Den mektigste mann i riket etter at Perdikkas var død var Antipatros. Perdikkas' motstandere samlet seg til et møte i Triparadisos (ved kildene til elven Orontes i dagens Libanon) hvor Aleksander
2 CONC s rike ble fordelt på nytt (avtalen i Triparadisos 321 f.Kr.). [10]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ved Triparadisos ble soldatene opprørske og la planer om slå sin herre Antipatros i hjel. Selevkos og Antigonos I Monofthalmos klarte imidlertid å forhindre dette. [11] For å forråde Perdikkas
2 CONC  ble Selevkos belønnet med den rike provinsen Babylon. Denne beslutningen kan ha vært Antigonos' forslag. Selevkos' Babylon var omgitt av Peukestas, satrapen av Persis; Antigenes, den nye satrap av 
2 CONC Susiana; og Peithon av Media. Babylon var en av de rikeste provinsene i riket, men dets militære makt var ubetydelig. Det er mulig at Antipatros delte opp de østlige provinsene i den hensikt at inge
2 CONC n enkeltstående satrap skulle kunne vokse seg sterkere enn noen av de andre. [10]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Etter Aleksanders død ble Arkon av Pella valgt til satrap av Babylon. Imidlertid hadde Perdikkas planer om å erstatte Arkon og nominere Antigonos Dokimos som hans etterfølger. I løpet av sin in
2 CONC vasjon av Egypt ble Dokimos sendt av Perdikkas til Babylon. Arkon gikk til krig mot ham, men falt i det påfølgende slaget. Således hadde Dokimos ikke til hensikt å overgi Babylon til Selevkos uten
2 CONC  kamp. Det er ikke klart hvordan Babylon ble tatt fra Dokimos, men i henhold til en babylonsk krønike ble en betydningsfull bygning i byen ødelagt i løpet av sommeren eller vinteren 320 f.Kr. Andre
2 CONC  babylonske kilder hevder at Selevkos kom til Babylon i enten oktober eller november 320 f.kr. Til tross for det antatte slaget, klarte Dokimos å flykte fra området.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I mellomtiden hadde riket igjen havnet i uroligheter. Peithon, satrapen av Media, myrdet Filip, satrapen av Partia, og erstattet ham med sin egen bror Eudemos som ny satrap. I vest gikk Antigonos I
2 CONC  Monofthalmos og Eumenes av Kardia (Aleksanders sekretær) til krig mot hverandre. Akkurat som Peithon og Selevkos, var Eumenes en av de tidligere tilhengerne av Perdikkas. Selevkos' største problem 
2 CONC var imidlertid Babylon i seg selv. De lokale innbyggerne hadde gjort opprør mot Arkon og støttet Dokimos. Det babylonske presteskapet hadde stor innflytelse over regionen. Babylon hadde også en bet

2 CONT <p>Etter at Antipatros var død i 319 f.Kr. fikk satrapen av Media ambisjoner om økt makt. Peithon samlet seg en stor hær på kanskje over 20 000 soldater. Under lederskapet til Peukestas samlet de 
2 CONC andre satrapene i regionen en egen, motstående hær. Peithon ble endelig beseiret i et slag som ble utkjempet i Partia. Han unnslapp til Media, men han ble ikke forfulgt av sine motstandere som isted

2 CONC Eumenes og hans hær var nord for Babylon; Antigonos forfulgte ham med en enda større hær; Peithon var i Media og hans motstandere i Susiana. Antigenes, satrap av Susiana og kommandant av argyraspid
2 CONC ene, var alliert med Eumenes, men Antigenes var Kilikia da det brøt krig mellom ham og Peithon.[13]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Peithon kom fram til Babylon enten høsten eller vinteren 317 f.Kr. Han hadde mistet et stort antall av sine soldater, men Selevkos hadde uansett færre soldater. Eumenes besluttet å marsjere til 
2 CONC Susa våren 316 f.Kr. Satrapene i Susa hadde åpenbart akseptert Eumenes' utsagn at han kjempet på vegne av den lovlige herskerfamilie mot troneraneren Antigonos. Han marsjerte sine soldater 300 stad
2 CONC ioner fra Babylon og forsøkte å krysse Tigris. Det tvang Selevkos til å handle. Han sendte to triremer (krigsskip) og en del mindre skip for å hindre Eumenes å krysse elven. Han forsøkte også �
2 CONC � få den tidligere hypasiti av argyraspidene til slå seg sammen med ham, men det skjedde ikke. Selevkos sendte også beskjeder til Antigonos. På grunn av hans mangel på soldater hadde Selevkos åp
2 CONC enbart ingen planer om faktisk å stoppe Eumenes. Han åpnet flomsperrene til elven, men den resulterende flommen stoppet ham ikke.[14]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Våren 316 f.Kr. slo Selevkos og Peithon seg sammen med Antigonos som fulgte etter Eumenes til Susa. Fra Susa dro Antigonos til Media hvor han kunne true de østlige provinsene. Han etterlot Selevk

2 CONC  og dro tilbake til sin egen provins. Hærene til Eumenes og hans allierte var ved et vendepunkt. Eumenes hadde to trefninger med Antigonos i 316 f.Kr. i slagene ved Paraitakene og Gabiene. Selv om be
2 CONC gge slagene ikke ble avgjørende i seg selv, var det argyraspidene som avgjorde fortsettelsen. De hadde fått høre at Antigonos hadde tatt deres hustruer og deres bytte fra alle årene med krigførin
2 CONC ger. De åpnet hemmelige forhandlinger med Antigonos, og ble enige om å utlevere Eumenes som øyeblikkelig ble henrettet. Hendelsene i den andre krigen til diakonene viste at Selevkos' hadde tålmodi

2 CONT <p>Antigonos tilbrakte vinteren i 316 f.Kr. i Media hvor stedets hersker igjen var Peithon. Sistnevntes begjær for makt hadde vokst, og han forsøkte å få en andel av Antigonos' til å gjøre oppr�

2 CONC bylon og ble tatt varmt imot av Selevkos. Forholdet mellom de to ble derimot snart kaldt. Selevkos straffet en av Antigonos' offiserer uten først å be om tillatelse fra Antigonos. Antigonos ble rase
2 CONC nde og krevde at Selevkos skulle gi ham inntekten fra provinsen, noe Selevkos nektet å gjøre.[17] Selevkos kunne likevel ikke føle seg trygg for Antigonos, og for ikke å ta sjanser med sitt eget l
2 CONC iv, flyktet han til Egypt sammen med 50 ryttere. Det er sagt at astrologer fra Kaldea hadde gitt Antigonos spådommen at Selevkos en gang ville bli herre over hele Asia og bli hans banemann. Etter å 
2 CONC ha hørt dette, sendte den overtroiske Antigonos soldater etter Selevkos som derimot først unnslapp til Mesopotamia og deretter til Syria. Antigonos henrettet Blitor, den nye satrapen av Mesopotamia,
2 CONC  for å ha gitt hjelp til Selevkos. Moderne forskere er skeptiske til fortellingen om spådommen, og det synes som om presteskapet i Babylon var imot Selevkos.[18]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Samtidig som Selevkos rømte mot Egypt var det stor uro i Makedonia. Kassandros, sønn av Antipatros, myrdet Filip III Arrhidaios, Aleksander den stores halvbror, sammen med Filips hustru Eurydike,

2 CONT <p>En annen Ptolemaios, en nevø av Antigonos, angrep Asandros. Selevkos dro tilbake til Kypros hvor Ptolemaios I Soter hadde sendt sin bror Menelaos sammen med 10 000 leiesoldater og hundre krigsskip
2 CONC . Selevkos og Menelaos begynte å beleire bystaten Kition på sørkysten av Kypros (i dag Larnaka). Antigonos sendte det meste av sin flåte til Egeerhavet og sin hær til Anatolia. Det ga Ptolemaios 
2 CONC I Soter muligheten til å angripe Syria hvor han beseiret Demetrios I Poliorketes, Antigonos' sønn, i slaget ved Gaza i 312 f.Kr. Det er sannsynlig at Selevkos deltok i dette slaget. Peithon, sønn a
2 CONC v Agenor, som Antigonos hadde forfremmet til som den nye satrap av Babylon, falt i slaget. Peithons død gjorde det mulig for Selevkos å vende tilbake til Babylon.[22]

2 CONT <p>Selevkos hadde forberedt godt sin tilbakekomst til Babylon. Etter slaget ved Gaza trakk Demetrios I seg tilbake til Tripoli mens Ptolemaios I Soter avanserte hele vegen fram til Sidon. Ptolemaios I

2 CONT <p>Kort tid etter at Selevkos kom tilbake, forsøkte Antigonos' tilhengere å gjenerobre Babylon. Nikanor var den nye satrap av Media og strategos for de østlige provinser. Hans hær besto av rundt 1

2 CONC det hvor Nikanor planla å krysse Tigris og angrep overraskende om natten. Evagoras falt i begynnelsen av slaget og Nikanor ble avsondret fra sine soldater. Da nyheten om at Evagoras var død spredte

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selv om Selevkos nå hadde en hær som utgjorde rundt 20 000 menn var de fortsatt ikke nok til å stå imot styrkene til Antigonos. Han visste heller ikke når Antigonos ville gjøre sitt motangrep
2 CONC . På den annen siden viste han minst to østlige provinser ikke hadde en satrap. Flertallet av hans soldater kom fra disse områdene. En del av Evagoras' soldater var persere, og en del av dem hadde 
2 CONC en grunn til å mislike Antigonos. Selevkos besluttet å dra fordel av dette. [24]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos fikk spedt ulike fortellinger i provinsene og blant soldatene. I henhold til en av dem hadde han i en drøm sett Aleksander den store stå ved siden ham. Eumenes hadde tidligere forsøkt d

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Etter atter igjen å ha blitt satrap av Babylon, ble Selevkos stadig mer aggressiv i sin politikk. På kort tid erobret han Media og Susiana. Historikeren Diodorus Siculus rapporterte at Selevkos e

2 CONT <p>Det er kjent at Selevkos greide å beseire Antigonos i minst ett avgjørende slag. Dette slaget er kun nevnt i Polyainos' verk Strategemata (Om strategier). Polyainos forteller at soldatene til Sel

2 CONT <p>=Seleucus I Nicator=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus I Nicator (c. 358 BC – 281 BC) (Ancient Greek: Σέλευκος Α΄ Νικάτωρ) was one of the Diadochi. Having previously served as an infantry general under Alexander the Great, h
2 CONC e eventually assumed the title of basileus and established the Seleucid Empire over much of the territory in the Near East which Alexander had conquered.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Alexander in June 323 BC, Seleucus initially supported Perdiccas, the regent of Alexander's empire, and was appointed Commander of the Companions and chiliarch at the Partition o
2 CONC f Babylon in 323 BC. However, after the outbreak of the Wars of the Diadochi in 322, Perdiccas' military failures against Ptolemy in Egypt led to the mutiny of his troops in Pelusium. Perdiccas was be
2 CONC trayed and assassinated in a conspiracy by Seleucus, Peithon and Antigenes in Pelusium sometime in either 321 or 320 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC, Seleucus was appointed Satrap of Babylon under the new regent Antipater. But almost immediately, the wars between the Diadochi resumed and Antigonus forc
2 CONC ed Seleucus to flee Babylon. Seleucus was only able to return to Babylon in 312 BC with the support of Ptolemy. From 312 BC, Seleucus ruthlessly expanded his dominions and eventually conquered the Per
2 CONC sian and Median lands. Seleucus ruled not only Babylonia, but the entire enormous eastern part of Alexander's empire:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''"Always lying in wait for the neighboring nations, strong in arms and persuasive in council, he [Seleucus] acquired Mesopotamia, Armenia, 'Seleucid' Cappadocia, Persis, Parthia, Bactria, Arabia, 
2 CONC Tapouria, Sogdia, Arachosia, Hyrcania, and other adjacent peoples that had been subdued by Alexander, as far as the river Indus, so that the boundaries of his empire were the most extensive in Asia af
2 CONC ter that of Alexander. The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus." — Appian, The Syrian Wars''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus' wars took him as far as India, where, after two years of war (305-303 BC), he made peace with the Indian Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, and exchanged his eastern satrapies in the Indus Rive
2 CONC r Valley for a considerable force of 500 war elephants, which would play a decisive role against Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC and against Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC
2 CONC .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''"The Indians occupy [in part] some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians: Alexander deprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements of 
2 CONC his own. But Seleucus Nicator gave them to Sandrocottus in consequence of a marriage contract, and received in return five hundred elephants." — Strabo, Geographica''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus' victories against Antigonus and Lysimachus left the Seleucid dynasty virtually unopposed in Asia and in Anatolia. However, Seleucus also hoped to take control of Lysimachus' European terr
2 CONC itories, primarily Thrace and Macedon itself. But upon arriving in Thrace in 281 BC, Seleucus was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court with his sister Lysandra.
2 CONC  The assassination of Seleucus destroyed Seleucid prospects in Thrace and Macedon, and paved the way for Ptolemy Ceraunus to absorb much of Lysimachus' former power in Macedon. Seleucus was succeeded 
2 CONC by his son Antiochus I as ruler of the Seleucid empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus founded a number of new cities during his reign, including Antioch (300 BC) and in particular Seleucia on the Tigris (ca. 305 BC), the new capital of the Seleucid Empire, a foundation that
2 CONC  eventually depopulated Babylon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Youth and family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was the son of Antiochus. Historian Junianus Justinus claims that Antiochus was one of Philip II of Macedon's generals, but no such general is mentioned in any other sources, and nothing i
2 CONC s known of his supposed career under Philip. It is possible that Antiochus was a member of an upper Macedonian noble family. Seleucus' mother was supposedly called Laodice, but nothing else is known o
2 CONC f her. Later, Seleucus named a number of cities after his parents. Seleucus was born in Europos, located in the northern part of Macedonia. Just a year before his birth (if the year 358 BC is accepted
2 CONC  as the most likely date), the Paeonians invaded the region. Philip defeated the invaders and only a few years later utterly subdued them under Macedonian rule. Seleucus' year of birth is unclear. Jus
2 CONC tin claims he was 77 years old during the battle of Corupedium, which would place his year of birth at 358 BC. Appianus tells us Seleucus was 73 years old during the battle, which means 354 BC would b
2 CONC e the year of birth. Eusebius of Caesarea, however, mentions the age of 75, and thus the year 356 BC, making Seleucus the same age as Alexander the Great. This is most likely propaganda on Seleucus' p
2 CONC art to make him seem comparable to Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a teenager, Seleucus was chosen to serve as the king's page (paides). It was customary for all male offspring of noble families to first serve in this position and later as officers in the king'
2 CONC s army.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A number of legends, similar to those told of Alexander the Great, were told of Seleucus. It was said Antiochus told his son before he left to battle the Persians with Alexander that his real fathe
2 CONC r was actually the god Apollo. The god had left a ring with a picture of an anchor as a gift to Laodice. Seleucus had a birthmark shaped like an anchor. It was told that Seleucus' sons and grandsons a
2 CONC lso had similar birthmarks. The story is similar to the one told about Alexander. Most likely the story is merely propaganda by Seleucus, who presumably invented the story to present himself as the na
2 CONC tural successor of Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>John Malalas tells us Seleucus had a sister called Didymeia, who had sons called Nicanor and Nicomedes. It is most likely the sons are fictitious. Didymeia might refer to the oracle of Apollo in Di
2 CONC dyma near Miletus. It has also been suggested that Ptolemy (son of Seleucus) was actually the uncle of Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Early career under Alexander the Great'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In spring 334 BC, as a young man of about twenty-three, Seleucus accompanied Alexander into Asia. By the time of the Indian campaigns beginning in late in 327 BC, he had risen to the command of the
2 CONC  élite infantry corps in the Macedonian army, the "Shield-bearers" (Hypaspistai, later known as the "Silvershields"). It is said that when Alexander crossed the Hydaspes river on a boat, he was accom
2 CONC panied by Perdiccas, Ptolemy I Soter, Lysimachus and also Seleucus. During the subsequent Battle of the Hydaspes (326 BCE), Seleucus led his troops against the elephants of King Porus. It is likely th
2 CONC at Seleucus had no role in the actual planning of the battle. He is also not mentioned as holding any major independent position during the battle, unlike, for example, Craterus, Hephaistion, Peithon 
2 CONC and Leonnatus – each of whom had sizable detachments under his control. Seleucus' Royal Hypaspistai were constantly under Alexander's eye and at his disposal. They later participated in the Indus Va
2 CONC lley campaign, in the battles fought against the Malli and in the crossing of the Gedrosian desert.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus took his future wife, the Persian princess Apama (daughter of Spitamenes), with him as his mistress into India, where she gave birth to his eldest son and successor Antiochus I Soter (325 
2 CONC BC). At the great marriage ceremony at Susa in the spring of 324 BC, Seleucus formally married Apama, and she later bore him at least two legitimate daughters (Laodice and Apama) and a son (Achaeus). 
2 CONC At the same event, Alexander married the daughter of the late Persian King Darius III while several other Macedonians married Persian women. After Alexander's death (323 BCE), when the other senior Ma
2 CONC cedonian officers unloaded their "Susa wives" en masse, Seleucus was one of the very few who kept his, and Apama remained his consort (later Queen) for the rest of her life.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ancient sources mention Seleucus three times before the death of Alexander. He participated in a sailing trip near Babylon, took part in the dinner party of Medeios the Thessalian with Alexander an
2 CONC d visited the temple of the god Sarapis.[citation needed] In the first of these episodes, Alexander's diadem was blown off his head and landed on some reeds near the tombs of Assyrian kings. Seleucus 
2 CONC swam to fetch the diadem back, placing it on his own head while returning to the boat to keep it dry. The validity of the story is dubious. The story of the dinner party of Medeios may be true, but th
2 CONC e plot to poison the King is unlikely. In the final story, Seleucus reportedly slept in the temple of Sarapis in the hope that Alexander's health might improve. The validity of this story is also ques
2 CONC tionable, as the Graeco-Egyptian Sarapis had not been invented at the time.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Senior officer under Perdiccas'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Alexander the Great died without a successor in Babylon on June 10, 323 BC. His general Perdiccas became the regent of all of Alexander's empire, while Alexander's physically and mentally disabled 
2 CONC half-brother Arrhidaeus was chosen as the next king under the name Philip III of Macedon. Alexander's unborn child (Alexander IV) was also named his father's successor. In the "Partition of Babylon" h
2 CONC owever, Perdiccas effectively divided the enormous Macedonian dominion among Alexander's generals. Seleucus was chosen to command the Companion cavalry (hetairoi) and appointed first or court chiliarc
2 CONC h, which made him the senior officer in the Royal Army after the regent and commander-in-chief Perdiccas. Several other powerful men supported Perdiccas, including Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Peithon and Eum
2 CONC enes. Perdiccas' power depended on his ability to hold Alexander's enormous empire together, and on whether he could force the satraps to obey him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>War soon broke out between Perdiccas and the other Diadochi. To cement his position, Perdiccas tried to marry Alexander's sister Cleopatra. The First War of the Diadochi began when Perdiccas sent A
2 CONC lexander's corpse to Macedonia for burial. Ptolemy however captured the body and took it to Alexandria. Perdiccas and his troops followed him to Egypt, whereupon Ptolemy conspired with the satrap of M
2 CONC edia, Peithon, and the commander of the Argyraspides, Antigenes, both serving as officers under Perdiccas, and assassinated him. Cornelius Nepos mentions that Seleucus also took part in this conspirac
2 CONC y, but this is not certain.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Satrap of Babylon'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most powerful man in the empire after the death of Perdiccas was Antipater. Perdiccas' opponents gathered in Triparadisos, where the empire of Alexander was partitioned again (the Treaty of Tri
2 CONC paradisus 321 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At Triparadisos the soldiers had become mutinous and were planning to murder their master Antipater. Seleucus and Antigonus, however, managed to prevent this. For betraying Perdiccas, Seleucus was 
2 CONC awarded the rich province of Babylon. This decision may have been Antigonus' idea. Seleucus' Babylon was surrounded by Peucestas, the satrap of Persis; Antigenes, the new satrap of Susiana and Peithon
2 CONC  of Media. Babylon was one of the wealthiest provinces of the empire, but its military power was insignificant. It is possible that Antipater divided the eastern provinces so that no single satrap cou
2 CONC ld rise above the others in power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Alexander, Archon of Pella was chosen satrap of Babylon. Perdiccas, however, had had plans to supersede Archon and nominate Docimus as his successor. During his invasion of Egypt
2 CONC , Perdiccas sent Docimus along with his detachments to Babylon. Archon waged war against him, but fell in battle. Thus, Docimus was not intending to give Babylon to Seleucus without a fight. It is not
2 CONC  certain how Seleucus took Babylon from Docimus, but according to one Babylonian chronicle an important building was destroyed in the city during the summer or winter of 320 BC. Other Babylonian sourc
2 CONC es state that Seleucus arrived in Babylon in October or November 320 BC. Despite the presumed battle, Docimus was able to escape.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile, the empire was once again in turmoil. Peithon, the satrap of Media, assassinated Philip, the satrap of Parthia, and replaced him with his brother Eudemus as the new satrap. In the west A
2 CONC ntigonus and Eumenes waged war against each other. Just like Peithon and Seleucus, Eumenes was one of the former supporters of Perdiccas. Seleucus' biggest problem was, however, Babylon itself. The lo
2 CONC cals had rebelled against Archon and supported Docimus. The Babylonian priesthood had great influence over the region. Babylon also had a sizable population of Macedonian and Greek veterans of Alexand
2 CONC er's army. Seleucus managed to win over the priests with monetary gifts and bribes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Second War of the Diadochi''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Antipater in 319 BC, the satrap of Media began to expand his power. Peithon assembled a large army of perhaps over 20,000 soldiers. Under the leadership of Peucestas the other sa
2 CONC traps of the region brought together an opposing army of their own. Peithon was finally defeated in a battle waged in Parthia. He escaped to Media, but his opponents did not follow him and rather retu
2 CONC rned to Susiana. Meanwhile, Eumenes and his army had arrived at Cilicia, but had to retreat when Antigonus reached the city. The situation was difficult for Seleucus. Eumenes and his army were north o
2 CONC f Babylon; Antigonus was following him with an even larger army; Peithon was in Media and his opponents in Susiana. Antigenes, satrap of Susiana and commander of the Argyraspides, was allied with Eume
2 CONC nes. Antigenes was in Cilicia when the war between him and Peithon began.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Peithon arrived at Babylon in the autumn or winter of 317 BC. Peithon had lost a large number of troops, but Seleucus had even fewer soldiers. Eumenes decided to march to Susa in the spring of 316 
2 CONC BC. The satraps in Susa had apparently accepted Eumenes' claims of his fighting on behalf of the lawful ruling family against the usurper Antigonus. Eumenes marched his army 300 stadions away from Bab
2 CONC ylon and tried to cross the Tigris. Seleucus had to act. He sent two triremes and some smaller ships to stop the crossing. He also tried to get the former hypasiti of the Argyraspides to join him, but
2 CONC  this did not happen. Seleucus also sent messages to Antigonus. Because of his lack of troops, Seleucus apparently had no plans to actually stop Eumenes. He opened the flood barriers of the river, but
2 CONC  the resulting flood did not stop Eumenes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the spring of 316 BC, Seleucus and Peithon joined Antigonus, who was following Eumenes to Susa. From Susa Antigonus went to Media, from where he could threaten the eastern provinces. He left Sel
2 CONC eucus with a small number of troops to prevent Eumenes from reaching the Mediterranean. Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, saw the situation as hopeless and returned to his own province. The armies of Eu
2 CONC menes and his allies were at breaking point. Antigonus and Eumenes had two encounters during 316 BC, in the battles of Paraitacene and Gabiene. Eumenes was defeated and executed. The events of the Sec
2 CONC ond War of the Diadochi revealed Seleucus' ability to wait for the right moment. Blazing into battle was not his style.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Escape to Egypt''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus spent the winter of 316 BC in Media, whose ruler was once again Peithon. Peithon's lust for power had grown, and he tried to get a portion of Antigonus troops to revolt to his side. Antig
2 CONC onus, however, discovered the plot and executed Peithon. He then superseded Peucestas as satrap of Persia. In the summer of 315 BC Antigonus arrived in Babylon and was warmly welcomed by Seleucus. The
2 CONC  relationship between the two soon turned cold, however. Seleucus punished one of Antigonus' officers without asking permission from Antigonus. Antigonus became angry and demanded that Seleucus give h
2 CONC im the income from the province, which Seleucus refused to do. He was, however, afraid of Antigonus and fled to Egypt with 50 horsemen. It is told that Chaldean astrologers prophesied to Antigonus tha
2 CONC t Seleucus would become master of Asia and would kill Antigonus. After hearing this, Antigonus sent soldiers after Seleucus, who had however first escaped to Mesopotamia and then to Syria. Antigonus e
2 CONC xecuted Blitor, the new satrap of Mesopotamia, for helping Seleucus. Modern scholars are skeptical of the prophecy story. It seems certain, however, that the Babylon priesthood was against Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During Seleucus' escape to Egypt, Macedonia was undergoing great turmoil. Alexander the Great's mother Olympias had been invited back to Macedon by Polyperchon in order to drive Cassander out. She 
2 CONC held great respect among the Macedonian army but lost some of this when she had Philip III and his wife Eurydice killed as well as many nobles whom she took revenge upon for supporting Antipater durin
2 CONC g his long reign. Cassander reclaimed Macedon the following year at Pydna and then had her killed. Alexander IV, still a young child, and his mother Roxane were held guarded at Amphipolis and died und
2 CONC er mysterious circumstances in 310 BC, probably murdered at the instigation of Cassander to allow the diadochs to assume the title of kingship.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Admiral under Ptolemy'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After arriving in Egypt, Seleucus sent his friends to Greece to inform Cassander and Lysimachus, the ruler of Thracia, about Antigonus. Antigonus was now the most powerful of the Diadochi, and the 
2 CONC others would soon ally against him. The allies sent a proposition to Antigonus in which they demanded that Seleucus be allowed to return to Babylon. Antigonus refused and went to Syria, where he plann
2 CONC ed to attack Ptolemy in the spring of 314 BC. Seleucus was an admiral under Ptolemy. At the same time he started the siege of Tyros, Antigonus allied with Rhodes. The island had a strategic location a
2 CONC nd its navy was capable of preventing the allies from combining their forces. Because of the threat of Rhodes, Ptolemy gave Seleucus a hundred ships and sent him to the Aegean Sea. The fleet was too s
2 CONC mall to defeat Rhodes, but it was big enough to force Asander, the satrap of Caria, to ally with Ptolemy. To demonstrate his power, Seleucus also invaded the city of Erythrai. Ptolemy, nephew of Antig
2 CONC onus, attacked Asander. Seleucus returned to Cyprus, where Ptolemy I had sent his brother Menelaos along with 10,000 mercenaries and 100 ships. Seleucus and Menelaos began to besiege Kition. Antigonus
2 CONC  sent most of his fleet to the Aegean Sea and his army to Asia Minor. Ptolemy now had an opportunity to invade Syria, where he defeated Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, in the battle of Gaza in 312 BC
2 CONC . It is probable that Seleucus took part in the battle. Peithon, son of Agenor, whom Antigonus had nominated as the new satrap of Babylon, fell in the battle. The death of Peithon gave Seleucus an opp
2 CONC ortunity to return to Babylon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus had prepared his return to Babylon well. After the battle of Gaza Demetrius retreated to Tripoli while Ptolemy advanced all the way to Sidon. Ptolemy gave Seleucus 800 infantry and 200 cav
2 CONC alry. He also had his friends accompanying him, perhaps the same 50 who escaped with him from Babylon. On the way to Babylon Seleucus recruited more soldiers from the colonies along the route. He fina
2 CONC lly had about 3,000 soldiers. In Babylon, Pethon's commander, Diphilus, barricaded himself in the city's fortress. Seleucus conquered Babylon with great speed and the fortress was also quickly capture
2 CONC d. Seleucus' friends who had stayed in Babylon were released from captivity. His return to Babylon was afterwards officially regarded as the beginning of the Seleucid Empire and that year as the first
2 CONC  of the Seleucid era.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Seleucus the Victor'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Conquest of the eastern provinces''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Soon after Seleucus' return, the supporters of Antigonus tried to get Babylon back. Nicanor was the new satrap of Media and the strategos of the eastern provinces. His army had about 17,000 soldier
2 CONC s. Evagoras, the satrap of Aria, was allied with him. It was obvious that Seleucus' small force could not defeat the two in battle. Seleucus hid his armies in the marshes that surrounded the area wher
2 CONC e Nicanor was planning to cross the Tigris and made a surprise attack during the night. Evagoras fell in the beginning of the battle and Nicanor was cut off from his forces. The news about the death o
2 CONC f Evagoras spread among the soldiers, who started to surrender en masse. Almost all of them agreed to fight under Seleucus. Nicanor managed to escape with only a few men.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Even though Seleucus now had about 20,000 soldiers, they were not enough to withstand the forces of Antigonus. He also did not know when Antigonus would begin his counterattack. On the other hand, 
2 CONC he knew that at least two eastern provinces did not have a satrap. A great majority of his own troops were from these provinces. Some of Evagoras' troops were Persian. Perhaps a portion of the troops 
2 CONC were Eumenes' soldiers, who had a reason to hate Antigonus. Seleucus decided to take advantage of this situation.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus spread different stories among the provinces and the soldiers. According to one of them, he had in a dream seen Alexander standing beside him. Eumenes had tried to use a similar propaganda
2 CONC  trick. Antigonus, who had been in Asia Minor while Seleucus had been in the east with Alexander, could not use Alexander in his own propaganda. Seleucus, being Macedonian, had the ability to gain the

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After becoming once again satrap of Babylon, Seleucus became much more aggressive in his politics. In a short time he conquered Media and Susiana. Diodorus Siculus reports that Seleucus also conque
2 CONC red other nearby areas, which might refer to Persis, Aria or Parthia. Seleucus did not reach Bactria and Sogdiana. The satrap of the former was Stasanor, who had managed to remain neutral during the c
2 CONC onflicts. After the defeat of Nikanor's army, there was no force in the east that could have opposed Seleucus. It is uncertain how Seleucus arranged the administration of the provinces he had conquere
2 CONC d. Most satraps had died. In theory, Polyperchon was still the lawful successor of Antipater and the official regent of the Macedonian kingdom. It was his duty to select the satraps. However, Polyperc
2 CONC hon was still allied with Antigonus and thus an enemy of Seleucus.

2 CONT <p>''Response''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus sent his son Demetrius along with 15,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry to reconquer Babylon. Apparently, he gave Demetrius a time limit, after which he had to return to Syria. Antigonus beli
2 CONC eved Seleucus was still ruling only Babylon. Perhaps Nicanor had not told him that Selucus now had at least 20,000 soldiers. It seems that the scale of Nicanor's defeat was not clear to all parties. A
2 CONC ntigonus did not know Seleucus had conquered the majority of the eastern provinces and perhaps cared little about the eastern parts of the empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Demetrius arrived in Babylon, Seleucus was somewhere in the east. He had left Patrocles to defend the city. Babylon was defended in an unusual way. It had two strong fortresses, in which Seleu
2 CONC cus had left his garrisons. The inhabitants of the city were transferred out and settled in the neighboring areas, some as far as Susa. The surroundings of Babylon were excellent for defense, with cit
2 CONC ies, swamps, canals and rivers. Demetrius' troops started to besiege the fortresses of Babylon and managed to conquer one of them. The second fortress proved more difficult for Demetrius. He left his 
2 CONC friend Archelaus to continue the siege, and himself returned west leaving 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Babylon. Ancient sources do not mention what happened to these troops. Perhaps Seleucus ha
2 CONC d to reconquer Babylon from Archelaus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Babylonian War''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Over the course of nine years (311–302 BC), while Antigonus was occupied in the west, Seleucus brought the whole eastern part of Alexander's empire as far as the Jaxartes and Indus Rivers under h
2 CONC is authority.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 311 BC Antigonus made peace with Cassander, Lysimachus and Ptolemy, which gave him an opportunity to deal with Seleucus. Antigonus' army had at least 80,000 soldiers. Even if he left half of his
2 CONC  troops in the west, he would still have a numerical advantage over Seleucus. Seleucus may have received help from Cossaians, whose ancestors were the ancient Kassites. Antigonus had devastated their 
2 CONC lands while fighting Eumenes. Seleucus perhaps recruited a portion of Archelaus' troops. When Antigonus finally invaded Babylon, Seleucus' army was much bigger than before. Many of his soldiers certai
2 CONC nly hated Antigonus. The population of Babylon was also hostile. Seleucus, thus, did not need to garrison the area to keep the locals from revolting.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Little information is available about the conflict between Antigonus and Seleucus; only a very rudimentary Babylonian chronicle detailing the events of the war remains. The description of the year 
2 CONC 310 BC has completely disappeared. It seems that Antigonus managed to conquer Babylon. His plans were disturbed, however, by Ptolemy, who made a surprise attack in Cilicia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>We do know that Seleucus managed to defeat Antigonus in at least one decisive battle. This battle is only mentioned in Stratagems in War by Polyaenus. Polyaenus reports that the troops of Seleucus 
2 CONC and Antigonus fought for a whole day, but when night came the battle was still undecided. The two forces agreed to rest for the night and continue in the morning. Antigonus' troops slept without their
2 CONC  equipment. Seleucus ordered his forces to sleep and eat breakfast in battle formation. Shortly before dawn, Seleucus' troops attacked the forces of Antigonus, who were still without their weapons and
2 CONC  in disarray and thus easily defeated. The historical accuracy of the story is questionable.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Babylonian war finally ended in Seleucus' victory. Antigonus was forced to retreat west. Both sides fortified their borders. Antigonus built a series of fortresses along the Balikh River while 
2 CONC Seleucus built a few cities, including Dura-Europos and Nisibis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Seleucia''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The next event connected to Seleucus was the founding of the city of Seleucia. The city was built on the shore of the Tigris probably in 307 or 305 BC. Seleucus made Seleucia his new capital, thus 
2 CONC imitating Lysimachus, Cassander and Antigonus, all of whom had named cities after themselves. Seleucus also transferred the mint of Babylon to his new city. Babylon was soon left in the shadow of Sele
2 CONC ucia, and the story goes that Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, moved the whole population of Babylon to his father's namesake capital in 275 BC. The city flourished until AD 165, when the Romans destro
2 CONC yed it.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A story of the founding of the city goes as follows: Seleucus asked the Babylonian priests which day would be best to found the city. The priest calculated the day, but, wanting the founding to fai
2 CONC l, told Seleucus a different date. The plot failed however, because when the correct day came, Seleucus' soldiers spontaneously started to build the city. When questioned, the priests admitted their d
2 CONC eed.

2 CONT <p>'''Seleucus the king'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The struggle between the Diadochi reached its climax when Antigonus, after the extinction of the old royal line of Macedonia, proclaimed himself king in 306 BC. Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Cassander and S
2 CONC eleucus soon followed. Also, Agathocles of Sicily declared himself king around the same time. Seleucus, like the other four principal Macedonian chiefs, assumed the title and style of basileus (king).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Chandragupta and the eastern provinces''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus soon turned his attention once again eastward. In the year 305 BC, Seleucus I Nicator went to India and apparently occupied territory as far as the Indus, and eventually waged war with the
2 CONC  Maurya Emperor Chandragupta Maurya:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Always lying in wait for the neighboring nations, strong in arms and persuasive in council, he [Seleucus] acquired Mesopotamia, Armenia, 'Seleucid' Cappadocia, Persis, Parthia, Bactria, Arabia, T
2 CONC apouria, Sogdia, Arachosia, Hyrcania, and other adjacent peoples that had been subdued by Alexander, as far as the river Indus, so that the boundaries of his empire were the most extensive in Asia aft
2 CONC er that of Alexander. The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus. He crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus, king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that stre
2 CONC am, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship. – Appian, History of Rome, The Syrian Wars 55''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Only a few sources mention his activities in India. Chandragupta (known in Greek sources as Sandrökottos), founder of the Mauryan empire, had conquered the Indus valley and several other parts of 
2 CONC the easternmost regions of Alexander's empire. Seleucus began a campaign against Chandragupta and crossed the Indus. Seleucus' Indian campaign was, however, a failure. It is unknown what exactly happe
2 CONC ned. Perhaps Chandragupta defeated Seleucus in battle. No sources mention this, however. But as most western historians note, Seleucus appears to have fared poorly as he did not achieve his aims. The 
2 CONC two leaders ultimately reached an agreement, and through a treaty sealed in 305 BC, Seleucus ceded a considerable amount of territory to Chandragupta in exchange for 500 war elephants, which were to p
2 CONC lay a key role in the forthcoming battles, particularly at Ipsus. The victorious Maurya king probably married the daughter of his Greek rival. According to Strabo, the ceded territories bordered the I
2 CONC ndus:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''The geographical position of the tribes is as follows: along the Indus are the Paropamisadae, above whom lies the Paropamisus mountain: then, towards the south, the Arachoti: then next, towards t
2 CONC he south, the Gedroseni, with the other tribes that occupy the seaboard; and the Indus lies, latitudinally, alongside all these places; and of these places, in part, some that lie along the Indus are 
2 CONC held by Indians, although they formerly belonged to the Persians. Alexander [III 'the Great' of Macedon] took these away from the Arians and established settlements of his own, but Seleucus Nicator ga
2 CONC ve them to Sandrocottus [Chandragupta], upon terms of intermarriage and of receiving in exchange five hundred elephants. — Strabo 15.2.9''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From this, it seems that Seleucus surrendered the easternmost provinces of Arachosia, Gedrosia, Paropamisadae and perhaps also Aria. On the other hand, he was accepted by other satraps of the easte
2 CONC rn provinces. His Persian wife, Apama, may have helped him implement his rule in Bactria and Sogdiana. Mainstream scholarship asserts that Chandragupta received vast territory west of the Indus, inclu
2 CONC ding the Hindu Kush, modern-day Afghanistan, and the Balochistan province of Pakistan. This would tend to be corroborated archaeologically, as concrete indications of Mauryan influence, such as the in
2 CONC scriptions of the Edicts of Ashoka which are known to be located in, for example, Kandhahar in today's southern Afghanistan. However, Ashoka's Edicts were inscribed two generations after any territori
2 CONC al handover by Seleucus and, for this reason, it is equally possible that the land in which these Edicts are to be found was incorporated into the Mauryan empire by Bindusara, Chandragupta's son and s
2 CONC uccessor, or Ashoka himself.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some authors claim that the argument relating to Seleucus handing over more of what is now southern Afghanistan is an exaggeration originating in a statement by Pliny the Elder referring not specif
2 CONC ically to the lands received by Chandragupta, but rather to the various opinions of geographers regarding the definition of the word "India":
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Most geographers, in fact, do not look upon India as bounded by the river Indus, but add to it the four satrapies of the Gedrose, the Arachotë, the Aria, and the Paropamisadë, the River Cophes 
2 CONC thus forming the extreme boundary of India. According to other writers, however, all these territories, are reckoned as belonging to the country of the Aria. — Pliny, Natural History VI, 23''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Also the passage of Arrian explaining that Megasthenes lived in Arachosia with the satrap Sibyrtius, from where he traveled to India to visit Chandragupta, goes against the notion that Arachosia wa
2 CONC s under Maurya rule:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Megasthenes lived with Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, and speaks of his often visiting Sandracottus, the king of the Indians. — Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri v,6''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nevertheless, it is usually considered today that Arachosia and the other three regions did become dominions of the Mauryan Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The alliance between Chandragupta and Seleucus was affirmed with a marriage (Epigamia). Chandragupta or his son married the daughter of Seleucus, Cornelia, or perhaps there was diplomatic recogniti
2 CONC on of intermarriage between Indians and Greeks. In addition to this matrimonial recognition or alliance, Seleucus dispatched an ambassador, Megasthenes, to the Mauryan court at Pataliputra (Modern Pat
2 CONC na in Bihar state). Only short extracts remain of Megasthenes' description of the journey.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The two rulers seem to have been on very good terms, as classical sources have recorded that following their treaty, Chandragupta sent various presents such as aphrodisiacs to Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus obtained knowledge of most of northern India, as explained by Pliny the Elder through his numerous embassies to the Mauryan Empire:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''The other parts of the country [beyond the Hydaspes, the farthest extent of Alexander's conquests] were discovered and surveyed by Seleucus Nicator: namely
2 CONT <p>* from thence (the Hydaspes) to the Hesudrus 168 miles</p>
2 CONT <p>* to the river Ioames (Yamuna) as much: and some copies add 5 miles more therto
2 CONT <p>* from thence to Ganges 112 miles</p>
2 CONT <p>* to Rhodapha 119, and some say, that between them two it is no less than 325 miles.
2 CONT <p>* From it to Calinipaxa, a great town 167 miles-and-a-half, others say 265.
2 CONT <p>* And to the confluent of the rivers Iomanes and Ganges, where both meet together, 225 miles, and many put thereto 13 miles more
2 CONT <p>* from thence to the town Palibotta 425 miles</p>
2 CONT <p>* and so to the mouth of the Ganges where he falleth into the sea 638 miles.  — Pliny the Elder, Natural history, Book 6, Chap 21''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Battle of Ipsus''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The war elephants Seleucus received from Chandragupta proved to be useful when the Diadochi finally decided to deal with Antigonus. Cassander, Seleucus and Lysimachus defeated Antigonus and Demetri
2 CONC us in the battle of Ipsus. Antigonus fell in battle, but Demetrius managed to escape. After the battle, Syria was placed under Seleucus' rule. He understood Syria to encompass the region from the Taur
2 CONC us mountains to Sinai, but Ptolemy had already conquered Palestine and Phonicia. In 299 BC, Seleucus allied with Demetrius and married his daughter Stratonice. Stratonice was also the daughter of Anti
2 CONC pater's daughter Phila. Seleucus had a daughter by Stratonice, who was also called Phila.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The fleet of Demetrius managed to destroy Ptolemy's fleet and thus Seleucus did not need to fight him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus, however, did not manage to enlarge his kingdom to the west. The main reason was that he did not have enough Greek and Macedonian troops. During the battle of Ipsus, he had less infantry t
2 CONC han Lysimachus. His strength was in his war elephants and in traditional Persian cavalry. In order to enlarge his army, Seleucus tried to attract colonists from mainland Greece by founding four new ci
2 CONC ties—Seleucia Pieria and Laodicea in Syria on the coast and Antioch on the Orontes and Apameia in the Orontes River valley. Antioch became his chief seat of government. The new Seleucia was supposed
2 CONC  to become his new naval base and a gateway to the Mediterranean. Seleucus also founded six smaller cities.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It is said of Seleucus that "few princes have ever lived with so great a passion for the building of cities. He is reputed to have built in all nine Seleucias, sixteen Antiochs, and six Laodiceas".
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Defeat of Demetrius and Lysimachus''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus nominated his son Antiochus I as his co-ruler and viceroy of the eastern provinces in 292 BC, the vast extent of the empire seeming to require a double government. In 294 BC Stratonice mar
2 CONC ried her stepson Antiochus. Seleucus reportedly instigated the marriage after discovering that his son was in danger of dying of lovesickness. Seleucus was thus able to remove Stratonice out of the wa
2 CONC y, as her father Demetrius had now become king of Macedonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The alliance between Seleucus and Demetrius ended in 294 BC when Seleucus conquered Cilicia. Demetrius invaded and easily conquered Cilicia in 286 BC, which meant that Demetrius was now threatening
2 CONC  the most important regions of Seleucus' empire in Syria. Demetrius' troops, however, were tired and had not received their payment. Seleucus, on the other hand, was known as a cunning and rich leader
2 CONC  who had earned the adoration of his soldiers. Seleucus blocked the roads leading south from Cilicia and urged Demetrius' troops to join his side. Simultaneously he tried to evade battle with Demetriu
2 CONC s. Finally, Seleucus addressed Demetrius personally. He showed himself in front of the soldiers and removed his helmet, revealing his identity. Demetrius' troops now started to abandon their leader en
2 CONC  massse. Demetrius was finally imprisoned in Apameia and died a few years later in captivity.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus and Ptolemy had supported Seleucus against Demetrius, but after the latter's defeat the alliance started to break apart. Lysimachus ruled Macedonia, Thracia and Asia Minor. He also had p
2 CONC roblems with his family. Lysimachus executed his son Agathocles, whose wife Lysandra escaped to Babylon to Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The unpopularity of Lysimachus after the murder of Agathocles gave Seleucus an opportunity to remove his last rival. His intervention in the west was solicited by Ptolemy Keraunos, who, on the acce
2 CONC ssion to the Egyptian throne of his brother Ptolemy II (285 BC), had at first taken refuge with Lysimachus and then with Seleucus. Seleucus then invaded Asia Minor and defeated his rival in the Battle
2 CONC  of Corupedium in Lydia, 281 BC. Lysimachus fell in battle. In addition, Ptolemy had died a few years earlier. Seleucus was thus now the only living contemporary of Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Administration of Asia Minor''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before his death, Seleucus tried to deal with the administration of Asia Minor. The region was ethnically diverse, consisting of Greek cities, a Persian aristocracy and indigenous peoples. Seleucus
2 CONC  perhaps tried to defeat Cappadocia, but failed. Lysimachus' old officer Philetairos ruled Pergamon independently. On the other hand, based on their names, Seleucus apparently founded a number of new 
2 CONC cities in Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Few of the letters Seleucus sent to different cities and temples still exist. All cities in Asia Minor sent embassies to their new ruler. It is reported that Seleucus complained about the number of
2 CONC  letters he received and was forced to read. He was apparently a popular ruler. In Lemnos he was celebrated as a liberator and a temple was built to honour him. According to a local custom, Seleucus w
2 CONC as always offered an extra cup of wine during dinner time. His title during this period was Seleucus Soter ("savior"). When Seleucus left for Europe, the organizational rearrangement of Asia Minor had
2 CONC  not been completed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Death and legacy'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus now held the whole of Alexander's conquests except Egypt and moved to take possession of Macedonia and Thrace. He intended to leave Asia to Antiochus and content himself for the remainder 
2 CONC of his days with the Macedonian kingdom in its old limits. He had, however, hardly crossed into the Thracian Chersonese when he was assassinated by Ptolemy Keraunos near Lysimachia September (281 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It seems certain that after taking Macedonia and Thracia, Seleucus would have tried to conquer Greece. He had already prepared this campaign using the numerous gifts presented to him. He was also n
2 CONC ominated an honorary citizen of Athens.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus founded the cult of his father. A cult of personality formed around the later members of the Seleucid dynasty and Seleucus was later worshipped as a son of god. One inscription found in I
2 CONC lion advises priests to sacrifice to Apollo, the ancestor of Antiochus' family. Several anecdotes of Seleucus' life became popular in the classical world.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy, son of a Macedonian nobleman and the most trusted of Alexander'sgenerals, was among the seven bodyguards attached to his person. In thedivision of the empire, Ptolemy takes Egypt as the sa
2 CONC fest and farthestplace to establish a dynasty. He even manages to carry off the body ofAlexander from Babylon to Egypt in order to bury him in Alexandria andthus enhance his own position.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Later Ptolemy mints a gold coin at Alexandria on which we see a car drawnby four elephants. Perhaps this is an attempt made by him to representAlexander's funeral cortege that included elephants.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antipater establishes himself in Macedon. He dies soon after and issucceeded by Cassander, his son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus Nicator, a youth of twenty-three of age when he accompaniesAlexander to Asia, wins distinction in the Indian campaign. Seleucus isgiven the government of the Babylonian satrapy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus defeats Eumenes, installed as satrap of Cappadocia, and has himput to death. He thus gets rid of his most dangerous rival. OstensiblyAntigonus and his son Demetrius Poliocertes hope to re
2 CONC unify Alexander'scollapsing empire but for their own purposes. Antigonus also controlsparts of Greece, Asia Minor and Syria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus sets himself up in Thrace.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Military clashes eventually occur as each tries to encroach on theother's territory. Ptolemy annexes Phoenicia to his possessions andplaces garrisons in the Phoenician port cities. Antigonus too de
2 CONC cides toenlarge his territory and set himself up as king of Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Returning from successful wars in Babylonia, Antigonus easily takes overthe cities of Phoenicia but meets with firm resistance from Tyre.Seventeen years have passed since Alexander took Tyre and th
2 CONC e city hasrecovered rapidly. Antigonus has few ships as Ptolemy is holding allPhoenician vessels and their crews in Egypt, so he decides to build afleet of his own. He camps before Tyre, summons all t
2 CONC he kings of thePhoenician cities and the viceroys of Syria and demands them to assisthim in building ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus blockades Tyre by land. He establishes three shipyards, one atTripolis, one at Byblos, one at Sidon. Diodorus Siculus records thatAntigonus collects wood-cutters, sawyers and shipwrights 
2 CONC from all regionsand has wood carried from the mountains of Lebanon to the sea. Eightthousand men are employed to cut and saw the timber; one thousand pairsof draught animals are used to transport it. 
2 CONC "This mountain range",Diodorus (19.58.3-5) writes, "extends along the territory of Tripolis,Byblos and Sidon and is covered with cedar and cypress trees of wonderfulbeauty and size." We thus have a de
2 CONC scription of the extent of theluxuriant forests covering the mountains of Lebanon about two thousandthree hundred years ago.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After a siege of fifteen months, Tyre is taken by Antigonus. He allowsPtolemy's garrison to leave and establishes his own in the city.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In order to enhance their personal prestige, Alexander's successorsstrike their own coins. On the obverse of his early silver coinage,Ptolemy has engraved the head of the newly deified Alexander wi
2 CONC th thesacred ram's horns of Ammon and an elephant headdress. Alexander's name,not his, appears on the reverse of his coins.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the coins of Seleucus, Alexander is portrayed as the god Dionysuswearing a helmet covered with panther skin adorned with a bull's ear andhorns.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus in his turn presents on his coins the diademed head ofAlexander, deified, wearing the sacred horns of Ammon. When Alexanderconquered Egypt, he was hailed by the high-priest of Ammon as t
2 CONC he son ofthe god and Alexander's generals are determined to let no one forget it.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 305 B.C. Antigonus and his son Demetrius assume the title of king.Ptolemy, Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus react to the challenge bydoing the same. Henceforth the effigies of these men, weari
2 CONC ng theMacedonian diadem, appear on their gold and silver coins. Their patrongods appear on the reverse. This ushurs in the age of royal portraiture.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The battle of lpsus in Phrygia in 301, called the "battle of the kings",signals the great military clash between Alexander's generals. The warelephant plays an important role in the outcome of this
2 CONC  battle and is thesymbol of military strength. The armies of Seleucus and Lysimachus withone hundred and fifty elephants cut off the infantry of Antigonus, leftmortally wounded on the battlefield.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notwithstanding, his son Demetrius rules Phoenicia until 287 when it onceagain passes back to Ptolemy. It remains a dependency of the Ptolemiesfor nearly seventy years. In the year 285 Alexander's 
2 CONC empire is neatlydivided between three of his former generals, Ptolemy in Egypt, Seleucusin Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and Lysimachus in Thrace.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At his death at the age of eight-four Ptolemy leaves behind him a wellorganized kingdom and the great library at Alexandria. He is succeeded byhis son, Ptolemy 11 Philadelphus (285-246).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The persistent lug of war between Ptolemies and Seleucids over Phoenicia,Syria and Palestine also results in great cultural changes in the region.Phoenician is discarded as a literary language and

2 CONT <p>Early life and ascent to power</p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was the son of Antiochus, a general of Philip II of Macedonia, the father of Alexander the Great. Seleucus participated in the conquest of the Persian empire as one of Alexander's officers
2 CONC , and in 326he commanded the Macedonian infantry against King Porus of India in battle on the Hydaspes River. In 324 Alexander ordered a mass wedding ceremony at Susa (in Persia) to put into practice 
2 CONC his ideal of uniting the peoples of Macedonia and Persia. On this occasion Seleucus marriedApama, the daughter of Spitamenes, the ruler of Bactria. Of all the Macedonian nobles, he was the only one wh

2 CONT <p>After Alexander died (323), Seleucus was given the command of the hetairoi (companions) cavalry and took part in the regent Perdiccas' campaign to oust Ptolemy, the governor (satrap) of Egypt. In E
2 CONC gypt, however, he joined with others in the assassination of Perdiccas. When the empire was divided in 321, he was given the governorship (satrapy) of Babylon. At the same time Antigonus Monophthalmus
2 CONC  (the One-Eyed) had been placed in command of a campaign against Eumenes of Cardia, a supporter of Perdiccas. In 317 Seleucus aided Antigonus but, after Eumenes' execution in 316, Antigonus demanded t
2 CONC hat Seleucus give an accounting of the income from his satrapy. Seleucus refused to give the accounting and escaped capture by fleeing to Ptolemy in Egypt.
2 CONT <p>From 316 to 312 Seleucus remained in Ptolemy's service. He took the initiative in forging a coalition among Ptolemy, Lysimachus (the ruler of Thrace), and Cassander (who laid claim to Macedonia) ag

2 CONT <p>Seleucus once again turned his attention to returning to Babylonia, and in August 312 he was able to reconquer Babylon with only a small army. This conquest marked the beginning of the Seleucid era
2 CONC , which is dated Dios 1 (Oct. 7), 312, in the Macedonian calendar and Nisan 1 (April 3), 311, in the Babylonian calendar. Antigonus ordered Nicanor, oneof his generals, to invade Babylonia from the ea

2 CONT <p>Little is known about the next few years of Seleucus' reign; he presumably used them to consolidate his gains. In the year 305 he followed the example of the other successors and assumed the title

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was the son of Antiochus, one of Philip's generals, and of Laodice. In 333 BC, as a young man of about twenty-three, he accompanied Alexander into Asia and won distinction in the Indian ca
2 CONC mpaign of 326 BC. When the Macedonian empire was divided in 323 BC (the "Partition of Babylon"), Seleucus was given the office of chiliarch, which attached him closely to the regent Perdiccas. Subsequ
2 CONC ently, Seleucus had a hand in the murder of Perdiccas during the latter's unsuccessful invasion of Egypt in 321 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the second partition, at Triparadisus (321 BC), Seleucus was given the government of the Babylonian satrapy. In 316 BC, when Antigonus had made himself master of the eastern provinces, Seleucus 
2 CONC felt himself threatened and fled to Egypt. In the war which followed between Antigonus and the other Macedonian chiefs, Seleucus actively cooperated with Ptolemy and commanded Egyptian squadrons in th
2 CONC e Aegean Sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The victory won by Ptolemy at the battle of Gaza in 312 BC opened the way for Seleucus to return to the east. His return to Babylon was afterwards officially regarded as the beginning of the Seleuc
2 CONC id Empire and that year as the first of the Seleucid era. Master of Babylonia, Seleucus at once proceeded to wrest the neighbouring provinces of Persia, Susiana and Media from the nominees of Antigonu
2 CONC s. A raid into Babylonia conducted in 311 BC by Demetrius, son of Antigonus, did not seriously check Seleucus' progress. Over the course of nine years (311-302 BC), while Antigonus was occupied in the
2 CONC  west, Seleucus brought the whole eastern part of Alexander's empire as far as the Jaxartes and Indus Rivers under his authority.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 305 BC, after the extinction of the old royal line of Macedonia, Seleucus, like the other four principal Macedonian chiefs, assumed the title and style of King. He established Seleucia on the Ti
2 CONC gris as his capital.

2 CONT <p>In the year 305 BC Seleucus I Nicator went to India, where he encountered Chandragupta Maurya. Through a treaty sealed in 303 BC, Seleucus ceded what is now Pakistan and southern Afghanistan but re
2 CONC ceived 500 elephants, which were to play a key role in the battles that were to come. To cement the treaty, there was either some sort of marriage alliance involving Seleucus' daughter or the diplomat
2 CONC ic recognition of intermarriage between Indians and Greeks.

2 CONT <p>The possession of Syria gave him an opening to the Mediterranean, and he immediately founded the new city of Antioch on the Orontes as his chief seat of government. Seleucia on the Tigris continued
2 CONC  to be the capital for the eastern satrapies. About 293 BC, he installed his son Antiochus there as viceroy, the vast extent of the empire seeming to require a double government.

2 CONT <p>It is said of Seleucus that "few princes have ever lived with so great a passion for the building of cities. He is reputed to have built in all nine Seleucias, sixteen Antiochs, and six Laodiceas"[
2 CONC 3].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The capture of Demetrius in 285 BC added to Seleucus's prestige. The unpopularity of Lysimachus after the murder of Agathocles gave Seleucus an opportunity for removing his last rival. His interven

2 CONC ar between Seleucus and Lysimachus broke out, and at the decisive battle of Corupedium in Lydia, Lysimachus fell (281 BC). Seleucus now held the whole of Alexander's conquests excepting Egypt in his h
2 CONC ands, and moved to take possession of Macedonia and Thrace. He intended to leave Asia to Antiochus and content himself for the remainder of his days with the Macedonian kingdom in its old limits. He h

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Demetrius I (Greek: Δημήτριος, 337-283 BC), called Poliorcetes (Greek: Πολιορκητής - "The Besieger"), son of Antigonus I Monophthalmus and Stratonice, was a king of
2 CONC  Macedon (294–288 BC). He belonged to the Antigonid dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the age of twenty-two he was left by his father to defend Syria against Ptolemy the son of Lagus; he was totally defeated in Battle of Gaza, but soon partially repaired his loss by a victory in 
2 CONC the neighbourhood of Myus. In the spring of 310, he was soundly defeated when he tried to expel Seleucus I Nicator from Babylon; his father was defeated in the autumn. As a result of this Babylonian W
2 CONC ar, Antigonus lost almost two thirds of his empire: all eastern satrapies became Seleucus'.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After several campaigns against Ptolemy on the coasts of Cilicia and Cyprus, Demetrius sailed with a fleet of 250 ships to Athens. He freed the city from the power of Cassander and Ptolemy, expelle
2 CONC d the garrison which had been stationed there under Demetrius of Phalerum, and besieged and took Munychia (307 BC). After these victories he was worshipped by the Athenians as a tutelary deity under t
2 CONC he title of Soter (σωτήρ) ("Preserver").
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the campaign of 306 BC against Ptolemy he defeated Menelaus, Ptolemy's brother, in the naval Battle of Salamis, completely destroying the naval power of Egypt. In 305 BC, now bearing the title o
2 CONC f king bestowed upon him by his father, he endeavoured to punish the Rhodians for having deserted his cause; his ingenuity in devising new siege engines in his unsuccessful attempt to reduce the capit
2 CONC al gained him the title of Poliorcetes. Among his creations were a battering ram 180 feet (55 m) long, requiring 1000 men to operate it; and a wheeled siege tower named "Helepolis" (or "Taker of Citie
2 CONC s") which stood 125 feet (38 m) tall and 60 feet (18 m) wide, weighing 360,000 pounds.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Coin of Demetrius I (337-283 BC). Greek inscription reads ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΔΗΜΗΤΡΙΟΥ ([coin] of King Demetrius)In 302 BC he returned a second time to Greece as liberator, and reinstated th
2 CONC e Corinthian League. But his licentiousness and extravagance made the Athenians long for the government of Cassander. Among his outrages was his courtship of a young boy named Democles the Handsome. T
2 CONC he youth kept on refusing his attention but one day found himself cornered at the baths. Having no way out and being unable to physically resist his suitor, he took the lid off the hot water cauldron 
2 CONC and jumped in. His death is seen as a mark of honor for himself and his country. In another instance, he waived a fine of 50 talents imposed on a citizen in exchange for the favors of Cleaenetus, that
2 CONC  man's son.[1] He also sought the attention of Lamia, a Greek courtesan. She demanded a price of 250 talents. He put a tax on soap to raise the money.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He also roused the jealousy of Alexander's Diadochi; Seleucus, Cassander and Lysimachus united to destroy him and his father. The hostile armies met at the Ipsus in Phrygia (301 BC). Antigonus was 
2 CONC killed, and Demetrius, after sustaining severe losses, retired to Ephesus. This reversal of fortune stirred up many enemies against him—the Athenians refused even to admit him into their city. But h
2 CONC e soon afterwards ravaged the territory of Lysimachus and effected a reconciliation with Seleucus, to whom he gave his daughter Stratonice in marriage. Athens was at this time oppressed by the tyranny
2 CONC  of Lachares - a popular leader who made himself supreme in Athens in 296 BC - but Demetrius, after a protracted blockade, gained possession of the city (294 BC) and pardoned the inhabitants for their
2 CONC  misconduct in 301.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the same year he established himself on the throne of Macedonia by murdering Alexander V, the son of Cassander. In 291 BC he married Lanassa, the former wife of Pyrrhus. But his new position as 
2 CONC ruler of Macedonia was continually threatened by Pyrrhus, who took advantage of his occasional absence to ravage the defenceless part of his kingdom (Plutarch, Pyrrhus, 7 if.); at length, the combined
2 CONC  forces of Pyrrhus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus, assisted by the disaffected among his own subjects, obliged him to leave Macedonia in 288 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He passed into Asia and attacked some of the provinces of Lysimachus with varying success. Famine and pestilence destroyed the greater part of his army, and he solicited Seleucus' support and assis
2 CONC tance. But before he reached Syria hostilities broke out, and after he had gained some advantages over his son-in-law, Demetrius was totally forsaken by his troops on the field of battle and surrender
2 CONC ed to Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His son Antigonus offered all his possessions, and even his own person, in order to procure his father's liberty. But all proved unavailing, and Demetrius died after a confinement of three years (2
2 CONC 83 BC). His remains were given to Antigonus and honoured with a splendid funeral at Corinth.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius was married five times:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p># His first wife was Phila daughter of Regent Antipater by whom he had two children: Stratonice of Syria and Antigonus II Gonatas.
2 CONT <p># His second wife was Eurydice of Athens, by whom he is said to have had a son called Corrhabus.
2 CONT <p># His third wife was Deidamia, a sister of Pyrrhus of Epirus. Deidamia bore him a son called Alexander who is said by Plutarch to have spent his life in Egypt, probably in an honourable captivity.
2 CONT <p># His fourth wife was Lanassa, the former wife of his brother-in-law Pyrrhus of Epirus.
2 CONT <p># His fifth wife was Ptolemais, daughter of Ptolemy I Soter and Eurydice of Egypt, by whom he had a son called Demetrius the Fair.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He also had an affair with a celebrated courtesan called Lamia of Athens, by whom he had a daughter called Phila.

2 CONT <p>'''Literary references'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Plutarch''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Plutarch wrote a biography of Demetrius (http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Demetrius*.html)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Hegel''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hegel, in the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, says of another Demetrius, Demetrius Phalereus that "Demetrius Phalereus and others were thus soon after [Alexander] honoured and worshipped in 
2 CONC Athens as God." What the exact source was for Hegel's claim is unclear. Diogenes Laërtius in his short biography of Demetrius Phalereus does not mention this. Apparently Hegel's error comes from a mi
2 CONC sreading of Plutarch's Life of Demetrius which is about Demetrius Poliorcetes and not Demetrius of Phalereus. Plutarch describes in the work how Demetrius Poliorcetes conquered Demetrius Phalereus at 
2 CONC Athens. Then, in chapter 12 of the work, Plutarch describes how Demetrius Poliorcetes was given honors due to the god Dionysus. This account by Plutarch was confusing not only for Hegel, but for other
2 CONC s as well.

2 CONT <p>''Others''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Plutarch's account of Demetrius' departure from Macedonia in 288 BC inspired Constantine Cavafy to write "King Demetrius" (ὁ βασιλεὺς Δημήτριος) in 1906, his earliest surviving 
2 CONC poem on a historical theme.

2 CONT <p>Demetrius is the main character of the opera Demetrio a Rodi (Turin, 1789) with libretto by Giandomenico Boggio and Giuseppe Banti. The music is set by Gaetano Pugnani (1731-1798).

2 CONT <p>Demetrius appears (under the Greek form of his name, Demetrios) in L. Sprague de Camp's historical novel, The Bronze God of Rhodes, which largely concerns itself with his siege of Rhodes.

2 CONT <p>The generals who succeed Alexander are Antigonus Cyclops orMonophthalmus, so-called because he lost an eye in battle, and his sonDemetrius Poliocertes, Antipater and his son Cassander, Seleucus,Pto
2 CONC lemy, Eumenes and Lysimachus. They argue bitterly among themselves foreach is determined to build a Hellenistic or Greek monarchy on the ruinsof Alexander's empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy, son of a Macedonian nobleman and the most trusted of Alexander'sgenerals, was among the seven bodyguards attached to his person. In thedivision of the empire, Ptolemy takes Egypt as the sa
2 CONC fest and farthestplace to establish a dynasty. He even manages to carry off the body ofAlexander from Babylon to Egypt in order to bury him in Alexandria andthus enhance his own position.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Later Ptolemy mints a gold coin at Alexandria on which we see a car drawnby four elephants. Perhaps this is an attempt made by him to representAlexander's funeral cortege that included elephants.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antipater establishes himself in Macedon. He dies soon after and issucceeded by Cassander, his son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus Nicator, a youth of twenty-three of age when he accompaniesAlexander to Asia, wins distinction in the Indian campaign. Seleucus isgiven the government of the Babylonian satrapy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus defeats Eumenes, installed as satrap of Cappadocia, and has himput to death. He thus gets rid of his most dangerous rival. OstensiblyAntigonus and his son Demetrius Poliocertes hope to re
2 CONC unify Alexander'scollapsing empire but for their own purposes. Antigonus also controlsparts of Greece, Asia Minor and Syria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus sets himself up in Thrace.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Military clashes eventually occur as each tries to encroach on theother's territory. Ptolemy annexes Phoenicia to his possessions andplaces garrisons in the Phoenician port cities. Antigonus too de
2 CONC cides toenlarge his territory and set himself up as king of Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Returning from successful wars in Babylonia, Antigonus easily takes overthe cities of Phoenicia but meets with firm resistance from Tyre.Seventeen years have passed since Alexander took Tyre and th
2 CONC e city hasrecovered rapidly. Antigonus has few ships as Ptolemy is holding allPhoenician vessels and their crews in Egypt, so he decides to build afleet of his own. He camps before Tyre, summons all t
2 CONC he kings of thePhoenician cities and the viceroys of Syria and demands them to assisthim in building ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus blockades Tyre by land. He establishes three shipyards, one atTripolis, one at Byblos, one at Sidon. Diodorus Siculus records thatAntigonus collects wood-cutters, sawyers and shipwrights 
2 CONC from all regionsand has wood carried from the mountains of Lebanon to the sea. Eightthousand men are employed to cut and saw the timber; one thousand pairsof draught animals are used to transport it. 
2 CONC "This mountain range",Diodorus (19.58.3-5) writes, "extends along the territory of Tripolis,Byblos and Sidon and is covered with cedar and cypress trees of wonderfulbeauty and size." We thus have a de
2 CONC scription of the extent of theluxuriant forests covering the mountains of Lebanon about two thousandthree hundred years ago.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After a siege of fifteen months, Tyre is taken by Antigonus. He allowsPtolemy's garrison to leave and establishes his own in the city.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In order to enhance their personal prestige, Alexander's successorsstrike their own coins. On the obverse of his early silver coinage,Ptolemy has engraved the head of the newly deified Alexander wi
2 CONC th thesacred ram's horns of Ammon and an elephant headdress. Alexander's name,not his, appears on the reverse of his coins.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the coins of Seleucus, Alexander is portrayed as the god Dionysuswearing a helmet covered with panther skin adorned with a bull's ear andhorns.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus in his turn presents on his coins the diademed head ofAlexander, deified, wearing the sacred horns of Ammon. When Alexanderconquered Egypt, he was hailed by the high-priest of Ammon as t
2 CONC he son ofthe god and Alexander's generals are determined to let no one forget it.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 305 B.C. Antigonus and his son Demetrius assume the title of king.Ptolemy, Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus react to the challenge bydoing the same. Henceforth the effigies of these men, weari
2 CONC ng theMacedonian diadem, appear on their gold and silver coins. Their patrongods appear on the reverse. This ushurs in the age of royal portraiture.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The battle of lpsus in Phrygia in 301, called the "battle of the kings",signals the great military clash between Alexander's generals. The warelephant plays an important role in the outcome of this
2 CONC  battle and is thesymbol of military strength. The armies of Seleucus and Lysimachus withone hundred and fifty elephants cut off the infantry of Antigonus, leftmortally wounded on the battlefield.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notwithstanding, his son Demetrius rules Phoenicia until 287 when it onceagain passes back to Ptolemy. It remains a dependency of the Ptolemiesfor nearly seventy years. In the year 285 Alexander's 
2 CONC empire is neatlydivided between three of his former generals, Ptolemy in Egypt, Seleucusin Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and Lysimachus in Thrace.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At his death at the age of eight-four Ptolemy leaves behind him a wellorganized kingdom and the great library at Alexandria. He is succeeded byhis son, Ptolemy 11 Philadelphus (285-246).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The persistent lug of war between Ptolemies and Seleucids over Phoenicia,Syria and Palestine also results in great cultural changes in the region.Phoenician is discarded as a literary language and 
2 CONC is replaced by Greek.Greek religious practices and beliefs take root but at the same time aPhoenician god travels south to Egypt and is honored with great pomp inAlexandria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Byblos is the center for the worship of Adonis, a youth of great beauty,loved by Aphrodite. In legendary tradition, Adonis is hunting the wildboar one day in the company of Aphrodite at Afka, the s
2 CONC ource of a riverhigh up in the mountains of Lebanon. The boar turns on him and gores histhigh. Adonis dies of the wound as his blood flows into the river turningthe waters red and the anemones in the 
2 CONC river valley scarlet. Aphroditeappeals to Zeus, king of the gods, to bring her lover back to life. Zeuspities the youth and allows him to pass part of the year on earth, theother part underground in H
2 CONC ades. His death is mourned annually at Byblos.He returns in the spring time to the upper world and there is greatrejoicing. Adonis in Phoenician means "lord" and is the title given tothe young god of 
2 CONC vegetation.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Theocritus, a Greek poet born in Syracuse c. 315 B.C., lived inAlexandria in the time of Ptolemy if Philadelphus. In his Idyll 15 hedescribes how the Festival of Adonis is celebrated in the city. O
2 CONC n thefirst day a great procession forms as women and children pour out intothe crowded streets to watch. Adonis has come back to life for a briefreunion with Aphrodite and there is great rejoicing. Th
2 CONC e second day isone of mourning as the women bewail the god's departure once again forthe underworld.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Alexandria, Adonis is represented by a graceful statue reclining on asilver couch in a temporary bower ornamented with birds and cupids. He isportrayed as a beautiful youth and the women cluster
2 CONC  around him as he iscarried through the streets in the procession. The crowd enters the royalpalace as part of the ceremony is performed there. Praises are sung toQueen Berenice, the mother of Philade
2 CONC lphus and Arsinoë, his sister-wife,one way of eulogizing the family of Ptolemy who patronize the festival.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the second day the women lament the departure of the youthful god. Atthe end of the festival the statue of Adonis is carried outside the cityand flung into the sea amidst the wailing and weeping
2 CONC  of the women.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The years roll by...</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Egypt descendants of Ptolemy rule at Alexandria, one after the other.In Syria a line of Seleucid kings, usurpers and imposters alike, sit onthe throne of Antioch.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great (223-187) makes Phoenicia abattlefield in his wars against the Ptolemies. Antiochus III drives theforces of Ptolemy IV Philopator out of Syria, takes Tyre 
2 CONC and Acre(Ptolemais) and even threatens Egypt. In the following years the citiesof Phoenicia pass back and forth between the two powers. In 196 B.C.Phoenicia and Coele Syria (the Bekaa valley) pass int
2 CONC o the possession ofthe Seleucid kings. The Phoenician cities welcome the change, for theestablishment and commercial expansion of Alexandria is a threat to theircommerce.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The discovery in 1897 of several painted funerary stelae in a gardensouth of Sidon point to the presence of Greek mercenaries in the armiesof the Seleucids during the second century B.C. These sold
2 CONC iers of fortunefrom the Greek mainland and cities of Asia Minor died here while onactive duty and were laid to rest forever in foreign land. The stelaetoday are exposed in the Archaeological Museum, I
2 CONC stanbul.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Seleucid monarchy is now in a state of chronic civil war. In thestruggle to seize the throne between the usurper Tryphon and AntiochusVII Sidetes during the latter part of the second century B.
2 CONC C., thesituation becomes so unbearable that merchants of Beirut desert the cityand open commercial establishments on the Greek island of Delos wherethey conduct a flourishing business.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But in the West the rise of Rome presents a danger. The Italian wars of91-83 B.C. keep the Romans at home. The chaotic conditions in Syriapermit Tigranes 11 the Great, king of Armenia, to overrun C
2 CONC appadocia andexpel one of the last feeble representatives of the Seleucid monarchy. By83 B.C. Tigranes sits on the throne at Antioch and his frontier extendsto Mount Lebanon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 69 B.C. the Roman general Lucullus arrives in the East, crosses theEuphrates in pursuit of Tigranes and invades Armenia. However his armydoes not support him so he withdraws to Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pompey replaces Lucullus in 66 B.C. Syria is taken out of the hands ofthe Seleucids once and for all on the ground that they have virtuallyceased to rule. Pompey turns the districts of the Seleucid
2 CONC  territory,including Phoenicia, Syria and Palestine into a new province named"Syria". Although this political move consolidates Roman authority in theEast and increases the annual revenue of the Roman
2 CONC  treasury, in return ameasure of security is given to the peoples of the region that they hadnot enjoyed since the conquests of Alexander. Anarchy and piracy isbrought under control and the cities of 
2 CONC Phoenicia turn to the sea andtrade

2 CONT <p>Demetrius I of Macedon</p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius I (337-283 BC, Greek: ??µ?t????), surnamed Poliorcetes ("Besieger"), son of Antigonus I Monophthalmus and Stratonice, was a king of Macedon (294 - 288 BC). He belonged to the Antigonid d
2 CONC ynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the age of twenty-two he was left by his father to defend Syria against Ptolemy the son of Lagus; he was totally defeated in Battle of Gaza, but soon partially repaired his loss by a victory in 
2 CONC the neighbourhood of Myus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After an unsuccessful expedition against Babylon, and several campaigns against Ptolemy on the coasts of Cilicia and Cyprus, Demetrius sailed with a fleet of 250 ships to Athens. He freed the city 
2 CONC from the power of Cassander and Ptolemy, expelled the garrison which had been stationed there under Demetrius of Phalerum, and besieged and took Munychia (307 BC). After these victories he was worship
2 CONC ped by the Athenians as a tutelary deity under the title of Soter ("Preserver").
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the campaign of 306 BC against Ptolemy he defeated Menelaus, Ptolemy's brother, in the naval Battle of Salamis, completely destroying the naval power of Egypt. In 305 BC, now bearing the title o
2 CONC f king bestowed upon him by his father, he endeavoured to punish the Rhodians for having deserted his cause; his ingenuity in devising new siege engines in his unsuccessful attempt to reduce the capit
2 CONC al gained him the title of Poliorcetes. Among his creations were a battering ram 180 feet long, requiring 1000 men to operate it; and a wheeled siege tower named "Helepolis" (or "Taker of Cities") whi

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He returned a second time to Greece as liberator. But his licentiousness and extravagance made the Athenians long for the government of Cassander. He also roused the jealousy of Alexander's Diadoch
2 CONC i; Seleucus, Cassander and Lysimachus united to destroy him and his father. The hostile armies met at the Ipsus in Phrygia (301 BC). Antigonus was killed, and Demetrius, after sustaining a severe loss
2 CONC es, retired to Ephesus. This reversal of fortune stirred up many enemies against him—the Athenians refused even to admit him into their city. But he soon afterwards ravaged the territory of Lysimach
2 CONC us and effected a reconciliation with Seleucus, to whom he gave his daughter Stratonice in marriage. Athens was at this time oppressed by the tyranny of Lachares, but Demetrius, after a protracted blo
2 CONC ckade, gained possession of the city (294 BC) and pardoned the inhabitants for their former misconduct.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the same year he established himself on the throne of Macedonia by murdering Antipater II, the son of Cassander. But his new position was continually threatened by Pyrrhus, who took advantage of
2 CONC  his occasional absence to ravage the defenceless part of his kingdom (Plutarch, Pyrrhus, 7 if.); at length, the combined forces of Pyrrhus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus, assisted by the disaffected among h
2 CONC is own subjects, obliged him to leave Macedonia in 288 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He passed into Asia and attacked some of the provinces of Lysimachus with varying success. Famine and pestilence destroyed the greater part of his army, and he solicited Seleucus' support and assis
2 CONC tance. But before he reached Syria hostilities broke out, and after he had gained some advantages over his son-in-law, Demetrius was totally forsaken by his troops on the field of battle and surrender
2 CONC ed to Seleucus. His son Antigonus offered all his possessions, and even his person, in order to procure his father's liberty. But all proved unavailing, and Demetrius died after a confinement of three
2 CONC  years (283 BC). His remains were given to Antigonus and honoured with a splendid funeral at Corinth. His descendants remained in possession of the Macedonian throne till the time of Perseus, when Mac
2 CONC edon was conquered by the Romans.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Phila (Greek: Φίλα; died 287 BC), daughter of Antipater, the regent of Macedonia, is celebrated by the ancient sources as one of the noblest and most virtuous women of the age in which she live
2 CONC d. Her abilities and judgment were so conspicuous even at an early age, that her father, Antipater, often consulted her in regard to political affairs.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Antonius Diogenes, she was married to Balacrus (probably the satrap of Cappadocia of that name) as early as 332 BC. In 322 BC, her father gave her in marriage to Craterus as a reward f
2 CONC or his assistance to Antipater in the Lamian War. After the death of Craterus a year later, she was again married to the young Demetrius Poliorcetes, the son of Antigonus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The date of her marriage is assumed to have taken place between 319 BC and 315, since the remains of her late husband were consigned to her care by Ariston, the friend of Eumenes in 315 BC. Despite
2 CONC  the large difference in age, Phila appears to have had great influence over her youthful husband, who treated her with the utmost respect and consideration, and towards whom she had great affection i
2 CONC n spite of his numerous amours and subsequent marriages. During the many vicissitudes of fortune which Demetrius experienced, Phila seems to have resided principally in Cyprus from whence she sent let
2 CONC ters and costly presents to her husband during the siege of Rhodes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Battle of Ipsus, she joined Demetrius, who sent her to her brother Cassander in Macedonia, to endeavour to effect a reconciliation and treaty between him and Demetrius. She appears to hav
2 CONC e again returned to Cyprus, where, in 295 BC, she was besieged in Salamis by the king of Egypt Ptolemy I, and ultimately compelled to surrender, but was treated by him in the most honourable manner an
2 CONC d sent together with her children in safety to Macedonia. Here she now shared the fortunes of her husband, and contributed to efforts to secure the loyalty of the Macedonian people. But when, in 287 B
2 CONC C, a sudden revolution once more precipitated Demetrius from the throne, Phila, unable to bear this unexpected reversal of fortunes and despairing of the future, took her own life at Cassandreia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Legacy'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Phila exerted her influence in the cause of peace, in protecting the oppressed, and in attempting to calm the violent passions of those who surrounded her. She left two children by Demetrius; Antig
2 CONC onus, surnamed Gonatas, who became king of Macedonia; and a daughter, Stratonice, married first to Seleucus I Nicator, and afterwards to his son Antiochus I Soter.[6] She also had a son by Craterus, w
2 CONC ho bore his father's name. The Athenians, in order to pay their court to Demetrius, consecrated a temple to Phila, under the name of Aphrodite.

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Phila (in Greek F???a; died in 287 BC), daughter of Antipater, the regent of Macedonia, is celebrated by the ancient sources as one of the noblest and most virtuous women of the age in which she li
2 CONC ved. Her abilities and judgment were so conspicuous even at an early age, that her father, Antipater, was in the often consulted her in regard to political affairs.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Antonius Diogenes2, she was married to Balacrus (probably the satrap of Cappadocia of that name) as early as 332 BC. In 322 BC, her father gave her in marriage to Craterus as a reward 
2 CONC for his assistance to Antipater in the Lamian war.1 After the death of Craterus a year later, she was again married to the young Demetrius Poliorcetes, the son of Antigonus.3
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The date of her marriage is assumed to have taken place between 319 BC and 315, since the remains of her late husband were consigned to her care by Ariston, the friend of Eumenes in 315 BC.4 Despit
2 CONC e the large difference in age, Phila appears to have had great influence over her youthful husband, who treated her with the utmost respect and consideration, and towards whom she had great affection,
2 CONC  in spite of his numerous amours and subsequent marriages. During the many vicissitudes of fortune which Demetrius experienced, Phila seems to have resided principally in Cyprus from whence she sent l
2 CONC etters and costly presents to her husband during the siege of Rhodes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the fatal battle of Ipsus, she joined Demetrius, who sent her to his brother Cassander in Macedonia, to endeavour to effect a reconciliation and treaty between him and Demetrius. She appears 
2 CONC to have again returned to Cyprus, where, in 295 BC, she was besieged in Salamis by the king of Egypt Ptolemy, and ultimately compelled to surrender, but was treated by him in the most honourable manne
2 CONC r, and sent together with her children in safety to Macedonia. Here she now shared the fortunes of her husband, and contributed not a little to secure the attachment of the Macedonian people to his pe
2 CONC rson. But when, in 287 BC, a sudden revolution once more precipitated Demetrius from the throne, Phila, unable to bear this unexpected reverse, and despairing of the future, put an end to her own life
2 CONC  at Cassandreia.5
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Phila's influence was ever exerted in the cause of peace, in protecting the oppressed, and in attempting to calm the violent passions of those who surrounded her. She left two children by Demetrius
2 CONC ; Antigonus, surnamed Gonatas, who became king of Macedonia; and a daughter, Stratonice, married first to Seleucus, and afterwards to his son Antiochus.6 She also had a son by Craterus, who bore his f
2 CONC ather's name. The Athenians, in order to pay their court to Demetrius, consecrated a temple to Phila, under the name of Aphrodite.7

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Alexander was founding the new city of Alexandria Eschate on the Jaxartes river, news came that Spitamenes had roused Sogdiana against him and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in Maracand
2 CONC a. Too occupied at the moment to personally confront Spitamenes he sent an army under the command of Pharnuches which was promptly annihilated with a loss of no less than 2000 infantry and 300 cavalry
2 CONC .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The uprising now posed a direct threat to his army, and Alexander moved personally to relieve Maracanda, only to learn that Spitamenes had left Sogdiana, attacking now Bactra, from where he was rep

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The decisive point came in December 328 BC when Spitamenes was defeated by Alexander's general Coenus at the Battle of Gabai. Spitamenes' wife killed him and sent his head to Alexander, suing for p

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus I Monophthalmus (Ancient Greek: Ἀντίγονος ὁ Μονόφθαλμος, Antigonus the One-eyed, 382–301 BC), son of Philip from Elimeia, was a Macedonian nobleman, general, and

2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Career''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus was appointed governor of Greater Phrygia in 333 BC. He was primarily responsible for defending Alexander's lines of supply and communication during the latter's extended campaign against
2 CONC  the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Following Alexander's victory at Issus, the Persian mercenary commander Memnon of Rhodes ordered a counter-attack into Asia Minor in an attempt to sever Alexander's lin
2 CONC es of supply and communication; however, Antigonus defeated the Persian forces in three separate battles.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As part of the division of the provinces after Alexander's death in 323 BC, Antigonus also received Pamphylia and Lycia from Perdiccas, regent of the empire, at the Partition of Babylon. He incurre
2 CONC d the enmity of Perdiccas, the regent, by refusing to assist Eumenes to obtain possession of the provinces allotted to him, Paphlagonia and Cappadocia. Leonnatus had left with his army for Greece, lea
2 CONC ving Antigonus alone to deal with Cappadocia, a task he apparently couldn't complete without additional aid.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Perdiccas seems to have viewed this as a direct affront to his authority and went up with the royal army himself to conquer the area. From there Perdiccas turned west towards Phrygia in order to hu
2 CONC mble Antigonus, who escaped with his son Demetrius to Greece, where he obtained the favour of Antipater, regent of Macedonia (321 BC), and Craterus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With the death of Perdiccas in 321 BC, a new attempt at division of the empire took place at Triparadisus and Antigonus found himself entrusted with the command of the war against Eumenes, who had 
2 CONC joined Perdiccas against the coalition of Antipater, Antigonus, Ptolemy, Craterus, and the other generals. Eumenes was defeated and forced to retire to the fortress of Nora (Greek: Νῶρα) in Cappa
2 CONC docia, and a new army that was marching to his relief was routed by Antigonus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Antipater died in 319 BC, he gave the regentship to Polyperchon, excluding Cassander, his son. Antigonus and the other dynasts refused to recognize Polyperchon, since it would undermine their 
2 CONC own ambitions. He entered into negotiations with Eumenes, but Eumenes had already been swayed by Polyperchon, who also gave him authority over anyone within the empire. Effecting his escape from Nora,
2 CONC  he raised an army and built a fleet in Cilicia and Phoenicia, and soon after formed a coalition with the satraps of the eastern provinces. Antigonus fought against Eumenes in two great battles at Par
2 CONC aitacene in 317 BC and Gabiene in 316 BC. Both were inconclusive, however. Yet in the aftermath of the second battle, Antigonus managed to capture the family and riches of the Silvershields, an elite 
2 CONC regiment within Eumenes' army, who in turn handed over Eumenes to Antigonus in return for their release. After some deliberation, Antigonus had Eumenes executed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a result, Antigonus now was in possession of the empire's Asian territories, his authority stretching from the eastern satrapies to Syria and Asia Minor in the west. He seized the treasures at S
2 CONC usa and entered Babylon. The governor of the city, Seleucus fled to Ptolemy and entered into a league with him, Lysimachus and Cassander (315 BC) against Antigonus. In 314 BC Antigonus invaded Phoenic
2 CONC ia, under Ptolemy's control, and besieged Tyre for more than a year. His son Demetrius was defeated at the Battle of Gaza by Ptolemy in 312 BC, and after the battle, Seleucus made his way back to Baby
2 CONC lonia. Seleucus returned to Babylon let him build up a base of his own, and he soon established control of the eastern satrapies. The Babylonian War began between Antigonus and Seleucus, where Seleucu
2 CONC s defeated both Demetrius and Antigonus, and secured Babylonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the war had been carried on with varying success from 315 to 311, peace was concluded, by which the government of Asia Minor and Syria was provisionally secured to Antigonus. This agreement w
2 CONC as soon violated on the pretext that garrisons had been placed in some of the free Greek cities by Antigonus, and Ptolemy and Cassander renewed hostilities against him. Demetrius Poliorcetes, the son 
2 CONC of Antigonus, wrested part of Greece from Cassander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After defeating Ptolemy at the naval Battle of Salamis in 306 BC, Demetrius conquered Cyprus. Following the victory Antigonus assumed the title king and bestowed the same upon his son, a declaratio
2 CONC n that he now was independent from the empire. The other dynasts, Cassander, Ptolemy, Lysimachus and Seleucus, soon followed. He now prepared a large army and a formidable fleet, the command of which 
2 CONC he gave to Demetrius, and hastened to attack Ptolemy in his own dominions. His invasion of Egypt, however, proved a failure; he was unable to penetrate Ptolemy's defences and was obliged to retire, ye
2 CONC t inflicting high losses on Ptolemy. Demetrius in 305 BC attempted the reduction of Rhodes, which had refused to assist Antigonus against Egypt. The siege of Rhodes lasted a year and ended in 304 BC w
2 CONC hen Demetrius, meeting with obstinate resistance, was obliged to make a peace treaty upon the terms that the Rhodians would build ships for Antigonus and aid him against any enemy except for Ptolemy, 
2 CONC on whom they bestowed the title Soter (savior) for his aid during the lengthy siege.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''The dynasts unite against Antigonus''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most powerful dynasts of the empire, now kings in their own right, Cassander, Seleucus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus, responded to Antigonus's successes by allying with each other, often through marr
2 CONC iage. Antigonus soon found himself at war with all four, largely because his territory shared borders with each of them. Once he had Cassander in a bad position, having gained the support of the Greek
2 CONC s and defeating him repeatedly, he demanded from Cassander the unconditional submission of Macedonia. Seleucus, Lysimachus and Ptolemy responded by joining forces and attacking him. Lysimachus invaded
2 CONC  Asia Minor from Thrace, crossing the Hellespont. He had soon secured most of the Ionian cities, and Seleucus was on his way marching through Mesopotamia and Cappadocia. Antigonus was obliged to recal
2 CONC l Demetrius from Greece, where his son had recently had a sterile encounter with Cassander in Thessaly; the two men, and their army, then moved against Lysimachus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, the army of father and son was defeated by the united forces of Seleucus and Lysimachus at the decisive Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. Antigonus himself died in the battle after being struck b
2 CONC y a javelin, in the eighty-first year of his life. Prior to Ipsus, he had never before lost a battle.[contradiction] With his death, any plans the court of Antigonus may have had of reuniting Alexande
2 CONC r's empire came to an end. Antigonus's kingdom was divided up, with most ending up in the hands of new kingdoms under Lysimachus and Seleucus. The victors largely followed Antigonus's precedent and ha
2 CONC d themselves named as kings, but they did not claim power over the erstwhile empire of Alexander nor each other. Instead, these kings established a troubled (and in the end failed) modus vivendi with 
2 CONC each other, and accepted their kingdoms as separate realms.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile, Antigonus's surviving son Demetrius took control of Macedon in 294 BC; Antigonus's descendants held this possession, off and on, until it was conquered by the Roman Republic at the Battl
2 CONC e of Pydna in 168 BC.

2 CONT <p>Antigonus I MONOPHTHALMUS ("One-Eyed"), also called ANTIGONUS I CYCLOPS (b. 382 BC--d. 301, Ipsus, Phrygia, Asia Minor [now in Turkey]), Macedonian general under Alexander the Great who founded the
2 CONC  Macedonian dynasty of the Antigonids (306-168 BC), becoming king in 306. An exceptional strategist and combat leader, he was also an astute ruler who cultivated the friendship of Athens and other Gre
2 CONC ek city-states.
2 CONT <p>Military campaigns.</p>
2 CONT <p>In 333 Alexander had appointed Antigonus satrap of Phrygia, and upon Alexander's death he also received the governorship of Pamphylia and Lycia from the regent of the Macedonian empire, Perdiccas. 
2 CONC He then formed an alliance against Perdiccas with Antipater, the governor of Macedonia, and with Ptolemy of Egypt, Lysimachus of Thrace, and Craterus (all of whom had served under Alexander). Perdicca
2 CONC s was murdered, and Antipater became regent of the empire. In 321 Antipater appointed Antigonus commander in chief of his army in Asia and sent him against Eumenes, the satrap of Cappadocia and an adh
2 CONC erent of Perdiccas. Antigonus defeated Eumenes and then besieged him unsuccessfully in the mountain fortress Nora. Polyperchon succeeded Antipater as regent, and Antigonus joined forces against him wi
2 CONC th Cassander (Antipater's son), Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Eumenes in 319. When Eumenes, his rival in Asia Minor (Anatolia), went over to Polyperchon, Antigonus defeated him with the aid of Seleucus and
2 CONC  Peithon (the satraps of Babylonia and Media, respectively) at Gabiene. Then, wishing to eliminate all possible rivals, Antigonus had both Eumenes and Peithon executed; Seleucus escaped to Egypt.
2 CONT <p>Antigonus was now in complete control of Asia Minor, but Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Cassander, and Seleucus allied themselves against him in the first coalition war (315-311) in an attempt to thwart his 
2 CONC plan of reuniting Alexander's empire. Antigonus occupied Syria and proclaimed himself regent. In order to win the support of the Greek city-states, whose resistance to subjugation presented the chief 
2 CONC stumbling block to the formation of a Hellenistic monarchy, he announced to his assembled army that all the Greeks should be free, autonomous, and ungarrisoned.This political slogan was to be sounded 
2 CONC again and again--almost immediately by Ptolemy and for a final time by the Romans in 196. With the aid of his officers in Greece, Antigonus drove out Cassander's Macedonian forces of occupation there 
2 CONC and formed the island cities in the Aegean into the League of the Islanders, preparatory to his invasion of Greece. His ally, the city of Rhodes, furnished him with the necessary fleet.
2 CONT <p>While he was engaged in conquering Caria, his son, Demetrius Poliorcetes, was defeated at Gaza by Ptolemy and Seleucus (312). Seleucus returned to his former province, Babylonia. In view of this ne
2 CONC w threat from the East, Antigonus decided to make peace with all of his adversaries except Seleucus. All of the diadochoi (Alexander's successors) confirmed the existing boundaries and the freedom of 
2 CONC the Greek cities. Antigonus, no longer regent but merely strategos (officer in charge) of the whole of Asia, was to rule in Syria and from the Hellespont to the Euphrates.
2 CONT <p>Activities in Greece.</p>
2 CONT <p>Then Ptolemy attacked Cilicia, and the second coalition war (310-301)against Antigonus broke out. In Greece in 307, Antigonus' son Demetrius ousted Demetrius of Phaleron, Cassander's governor of At
2 CONC hens, and reestablished the old Athenian constitution. The grateful Athenians honoured Antigonus and Demetrius as divine saviours (theoi soteres). Cassander's influence in Greece was now broken, and i
2 CONC n 306 Demetrius defeated Ptolemy's fleet near Salamis on the island of Cyprus and conqueredthe island. This victory gave Antigonus control of the Aegean, of theeastern Mediterranean, and of all of the
2 CONC  Near East except Babylonia. The assembled army proclaimed him king, and his friends adorned him with the diadem. For his part, he appointed Demetrius king and co-regentand sent him the diadem. This w
2 CONC as to become a traditional ceremony inthe Hellenistic monarchy.
2 CONT <p>In 305, after Antigonus had vainly attacked Egypt, Ptolemy also assumed the title of king, and Cassander, Lysimachus, and Seleucus followedsuit. The partition of Alexander's empire into five states
2 CONC  had now been formally established. In 305 Antigonus sent Demetrius to conquer Rhodes, which had refused him armed support against Ptolemy. After a year's unsuccessful siege he concluded a peace treat
2 CONC y and an alliance with the island state, guaranteeing it autonomy and neutrality in his conflicts with Ptolemy. This concession was necessary because in the meantime Cassander had invaded Attica and w
2 CONC as besieging Athens. Demetriusdrove him out of central Greece, and the Athenians bestowed on him a new religious honour, synnaos ("having the same temple") of the templeof the goddess Athena.
2 CONT <p>In 303 he occupied Corinth, Sicyon, and Argos in the Peloponnese, andAchaea, Elis, and almost all of Arcadia joined his side. In 302 Antigonus and Demetrius crowned their success by renewing the pa
2 CONC n-Hellenic league, which Philip II of Macedonia had formed in 337. Ambassadors from all the Hellenic states--with the exception of Sparta, Messenia, and Thessaly--elected Antigonus and Demetrius prote
2 CONC ctors of the new league at Corinth. It was to be an "eternal" treaty, extending to the descendants of the kings. Each member state furnished a contingent of troops for a league army that was commanded
2 CONC  by the kings or their deputies. The league was to ensure a general peace in Hellas, but first and foremost it was to aid Antigonus against Cassander.
2 CONT <p>Final campaigns.</p>
2 CONT <p>Now at the zenith of his power, Antigonus demanded Cassander's unconditional submission. He wanted possession of Macedonia, the native landof his dynasty, and to establish his dominion over Alexand
2 CONC er's formerempire. The other diadochoi, however, warned by Cassander's fate, nowjoined forces to attack the omnivorous old man. From Babylonia, Seleucus invaded Asia Minor, Ptolemy attacked Syria, and
2 CONC  Lysimachus moved into the western part of Asia Minor. Docimus, the regent of Phrygia, and Phoenix, the strategos of Lycia, deserted Antigonus. He, in turn, recalled Demetrius, left his capital city, 
2 CONC Antigoneia (which he had founded on the Orontes in 306), and crossed the Taurus Mountains. Lysimachus, who was waiting for Seleucus, avoided an engagement. In vain Antigonus sent a corps of raiders in
2 CONC to Babylonia in order to divide his enemies' forces. In 301 the united armies of Lysimachus and Seleucus engaged the forces of Antigonus and Demetrius at Ipsus in Phrygia. Demetrius made the error of 
2 CONC pursuing the enemy's cavalry too far, and as a result Antigonus, age 80, lost the battle and his life.
2 CONT <p>Antigonus had been an excellent strategist who, until then, had neverlost a battle. He had a genuine admiration for Greek civilization. Hefounded several cities, especially in Asia Minor, and unite
2 CONC d several small communities into unitary, large centres: Lebedus (Lebedos) and Teos, for example. Several Greek artists graced his court; Apelles painted his portrait in profile because of his missing

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus I Cyclops or Monophthalmus ("the One-eyed", so called from his having lost an eye) (382 BC - 301 BC) was a Macedonian nobleman, general, and satrap under Alexander the Great. He was a maj
2 CONC or figure in the Wars of the Diadochi after Alexander's death. He established the Antigonid dynasty and declared himself King in 306 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus was appointed governor of Greater Phrygia in 333 BC, and in the division of the provinces after Alexander's death in 323 BC he also received Pamphylia and Lycia from Perdiccas, regent of 
2 CONC the empire. He incurred the enmity of Perdiccas, the regent, by refusing to assist Eumenes to obtain possession of the provinces allotted to him. In danger of his life he escaped with his son Demetriu
2 CONC s into Greece, where he obtained the favour of Antipater, regent of Macedonia (321 BC). Soon after, on Perdiccas's death in 321 BC, a new division of empire took place. Antigonus found himself entrust
2 CONC ed with the command of the war against Eumenes, who had joined Perdiccas against the coalition of Antipater, Antigonus, Ptolemy, Craterus, and the other generals. Eumenes was defeated and forced to re
2 CONC tire to the fortress of Nora in Cappadocia, and a new army that was marching to his relief was routed by Antigonus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Polyperchon succeeded Antipater regent of the empire in 319 BC, to the exclusion of Cassander, his son. Antigonus resolved to set himself up as lord of all Asia, and in conjunction with Cassander a
2 CONC nd Ptolemy of Egypt, refused to recognize Polyperchon. He entered into negotiations with Eumenes; but Eumenes remained faithful to the royal house. Effecting his escape from Nora, he raised an army, a
2 CONC nd formed a coalition with the satraps of the eastern provinces. Antigonus fought against Eumenes two great battles at Paraitacene in 317 BC and Gabiene in 316 BC, following which Eumenes was at last 
2 CONC delivered up to Antigonus through treachery in Persia and put to death (316 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus again claimed authority over most Asia, seized the treasures at Susa and entered Babylon, of which Seleucus was governor. Seleucus fled to Ptolemy and entered into a league with him, Lysi
2 CONC machus and Cassander (315 BC) against Antigonus. In 314 BC Antigonus invaded Syria, under Ptolemy's control, and besieged Tyre for more than a year. His son Demetrius was defeated at the Battle of Gaz
2 CONC a by Ptolemy in 312 BC and lost Babylonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the war had been carried on with varying success from 315 to 311, peace was concluded, by which the government of Asia Minor and Syria was provisionally secured to Antigonus. This agreement w
2 CONC as soon violated on the pretext that garrisons had been placed in some of the free Greek cities by Antigonus, and Ptolemy and Cassander renewed hostilities against him. Demetrius Poliorcetes, the son 
2 CONC of Antigonus, wrested part of Greece from Cassander. At first Ptolemy had made a successful descent upon Asia Minor and on several of the islands of the Archipelago; but he was at length totally defea
2 CONC ted by Demetrius at the naval battle of Salamis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius conquered Cyprus in 306 BC. Following the victory Antigonus assumed the title king and bestowed the same upon his son, a declaration that he was claiming to be Alexander's heir. He now pr
2 CONC epared a large army and a formidable fleet, the command of which he gave to Demetrius, and hastened to attack Ptolemy in his own dominions. His invasion of Egypt, however, proved a failure; he was una
2 CONC ble to penetrate Ptolemy's defences and was obliged to retire. Demetrius in 305 BC attempted the reduction of Rhodes, which had refused to assist Antigonus against Egypt. The siege of Rhodes lasted a 
2 CONC year and ended in 304 BC when Demetrius meeting with obstinate resistance, he was obliged to make a peace treaty upon the best terms that he could.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most powerful satraps of the empire, Cassander, Seleucus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus, responded to Antigonus's assumption of the royal title by proclaiming themselves also kings. Antigonus soon fou
2 CONC nd himself at war with all four, largely because his territory shared borders with each of them. He demanded from Cassander the unconditional submission of Macedonia. Seleucus, Lysimachus and Ptolemy 
2 CONC joined forces and attacked him. He was obliged to recall Demetrius from Greece, although he was again winning success after success there, and moved against Lysimachus. The army of father and son was 
2 CONC defeated by the united forces of Seleucus and Lysimachus at the decisive Ipsus in 301 BC. Antigonus himself died in the battle after being struck by a javelin, in the eighty-first year of his age. Pri
2 CONC or to Ipsus, he had never before had lost a battle. With his death any plans he may have had of reuniting Alexander's Empire came to an end. The victors did not claim power over each other, but instea
2 CONC d accepted their kingdoms as separate. Antigonus's kingdom was divided up, with most ending up in the hands of Lysimachus and Seleucus.

2 CONT <p>Yervand I (Armenian: Երուանդ Ա, Yervand I) Armenian was a King of the Orontid Dynasty who reigned during the period between 401-344 BC. The Persian version of the name is Auruand which mean
2 CONC t "Great Warrior" in the Avestan language. It is likely this was a special title given by the Persian king to a chosen Armenian man, though this seems to have become a hereditary title in that family.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the Greek sources (Herodotus, Strabo) Orontes was made Satrap of Sophene and Matiene (Mitanni). Orontes I had at least 3,000 talents of silver.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In about 401 BC, he married princess Rhodogune, daughter of the Persian Great King Artaxerxes II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was given these Satrapies after the Battle of Cunaxa in 401 BC for supporting Artaxerxes II against Cyrus the Younger. It is likely he ruled from Armavir as the previous Satrap of Armenia, Hydar
2 CONC nes, had ruled from there. He also married Rodogoune, the daughter of king Artaxerxes II by one of his concubines. He is next recorded in 381 BC for the campaign to recapture Cyprus from its rebel lea
2 CONC der, King Evagoras, commanding the army, whilst the navy was under the command of Tiribazus. They managed to lay siege to the city of Salamis, however Orontes then impeached Tiribazus to king Artaxerx
2 CONC es II. Before three Persian noble judges, Orontes was found guilty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 362 BC a great rebellion occurred in Anatolia, led by Datames, Satrap of Cappadocia (Revolt of the Satraps). Some sources say that it was Orontes who was chosen by the rebels as their leader. Ho
2 CONC wever Orontes stayed loyal to king Artaxerxes II and aided in the collapse of the rebellion. Apparently he wanted to rule Anatolia and Armenia alone. He captured the city of Pergamon and sent bribe mo
2 CONC ney to Athens, where a decree records his name for an alliance. He had enough funds to plot such things as he is recorded to have had a personal fortune of 3,000 talents of silver.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 355 BC he rebelled against the new king of the Achaemenid Empire, Artaxerxes III. He still had possession of parts of western Anatolia, he fought a battle against the satrap of Daskyleion and mi
2 CONC nted his own coins in Ionia, such as the one displayed in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. He handed back Pergamon to the king and subsequently died.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The kings of the Kingdom of Commagene claimed descent from Orontes with Darius I of Persia as their ancestor, by his marriage to Rodogoune, daughter of Artaxerxes II who had a family descent from k
2 CONC ing Darius I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some ancient Greek sources called Orontes a "Bactrian", though it was because his father, Artasyrus (Artaxerxes), had been the Satrap of Bactria during the reign of King Artaxerxes II. Some say Art
2 CONC asyrus he was in fact Artaxerxes II, who had seven known children and eleven children whose names are not known in Western historical records. It is interesting that during the Achaemenid Empire, Bact
2 CONC ria was ruled by the heir to the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Xenophon's Anabasis mentions that the region near the river Centrites was defended by the Satrap of Armenia for Artaxerxes II, named Orontes son of Artasyrus who had Armenian contingents. Xenophon 
2 CONC mentioned that he had a son called Tigranes. His successor was Darius III and after Codomannus these Satrapies were ruled by Orontes II. Whether he was the same person as Tigranes but had adopted the 
2 CONC name Orontes or that they were brothers is not known.

2 CONT <p> II Mnemon (Old Persian: 𐎠𐎼𐎫𐎧𐏁𐏂𐎠[1] Artaxšaçā, Ancient Greek: Ἀρταξέρξης) was king of Persia from 404 BC until his death. He was a son of Darius II of Persia and 
2 CONC Parysatis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He defended his position against his brother Cyrus the Younger, who was defeated and killed at the Battle of Cunaxa in 401 BC, and against a revolt of the provincial governors, the satraps (366 –
2 CONC  358 BC). He also became involved in a war with Persia's erstwhile allies, the Spartans, who, under Agesilaus II, invaded Asia Minor. In order to redirect the Spartans attention to Greek affairs, Arta
2 CONC xerxes subsidized their enemies: in particular the Athenians, Thebans, and Corinthians. These subsidies helped to engage the Spartans in what would become known as the Corinthian War. In 386 BC, Artax
2 CONC erxes II betrayed his allies and came to an arrangement with Sparta, and in the Treaty of Antalcidas he forced his erstwhile allies to come to terms. This treaty restored control of the Greek cities o
2 CONC f Ionia and Aeolis on the Anatolian coast to the Persians, while giving Sparta dominance on the Greek mainland.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although successful against the Greeks, Artaxerxes had more trouble with the Egyptians, who had successfully revolted against him at the beginning of his reign. An attempt to reconquer Egypt in 373
2 CONC  BC was completely unsuccessful, but in his waning years the Persians did manage to defeat a joint Egyptian–Spartan effort to conquer Phoenicia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He is reported to have had a number of wives. His main wife was Stateira, until she was poisoned by Artaxerxes' mother Parysatis in about 400 BC. Another chief wife was a Greek woman of Phocaea nam
2 CONC ed Aspasia (not the same as the concubine of Pericles). Artaxerxes II is said to have more than 115 sons from 350 wives.[2] He also is said to have loved a young eunuch by the name of Tiridates, who d
2 CONC ied "as he was emerging from childhood". His death caused Artaxerxes enormous grief, and there was public mourning for him throughout the empire as an offering to the king from his subjects. According
2 CONC  to Claudius Aelianus, Artaxerxes was brought out of the mourning by Aspasia, after she wore the eunuch's cloak over her dress.[3]

2 CONT <p>On ascending the throne, Ochus assumed the name of Darius. His confidential advisers were three eunuchs, who ruled the empire in his name—Artoxares, who had taken such a prominent part in the cam
2 CONC paign which won him the crown, Artibarzanes, and Athôos; but the guiding spirit of his government was, in reality, his wife, the detestable Parysatis. She had already borne him two children before sh
2 CONC e became queen; a daughter, Amestris, and a son, Arsaces, who afterwards became king under the name of Artaxerxes. Soon after the accession of her husband, she bore him a second son, whom she named Cy
2 CONC rus, in memory of the founder of the empire, and a daughter, Artostê; several other children were born subsequently, making thirteen in all, but these all died in childhood, except one named Oxendras
2 CONC . Violent, false, jealous, and passionately fond of the exercise of power, Parysatis hesitated at no crime to rid herself of those who thwarted her schemes, even though they might be members of her ow
2 CONC n family; and, not content with putting them out of the way, she delighted in making them taste her hatred to the full, by subjecting them to the most skilfully graduated refinements of torture; she d
2 CONC eservedly left behind her the reputation of being one of the most cruel of all the cruel queens, whose memory was a terror not only to the harems of Persia, but to the whole of the Eastern world. The 
2 CONC numerous revolts which broke out soon after her husband's accession, furnished occasions for the revelation of her perfidious cleverness....

2 CONC determined to remedy them: his death, perhaps, was an irreparable misfortune for his country. Had he survived and supplanted the feeble Artaxerxes, it is quite possible that he might have confirmed an

2 CONC ocoristicon "Arshu" for Artaxerxes II found on a contemporary inscription (LBAT 162[7]). These sources thus arguably identify Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II in light of the names used in the Hebrew and Gr

2 CONT <p>Artaxerxes II of Persia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artaxerxes II Memnon (c. 436 - 358 BC) was king of Persia from 404 BC until his death. He defended his position against his brother Cyrus the Younger, who was defeated and killed at the Battle of C
2 CONC unaxa in 401 BC, and against a revolt of the provincial governors, the satraps (366 - 358). He also became involved in a war with Persia's erstwhile allies, the Spartans, who, under Agesilaus, invaded
2 CONC  Asia Minor. To keep the Spartans busy, Artaxerxes subsidized their enemies in Greece - the Athenians, Thebans, and Corinthians, especially - to keep them busy back at home, in what would become known
2 CONC  as the Corinthian War. In 386 BC Artaxerxes II stabbed his allies in the back and came to an arrangement with Sparta, and in the Treaty of Antalcidas forced his erstwhile allies to come to terms. Thi
2 CONC s treaty restored control of the Greek cities of Ionia and Aeolis on the Anatolian coast to the Persians, while giving Sparta dominance on the Greek mainland.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although thus rather successful against the Greeks, Artaxerxes had more trouble with the Egyptians, who had successfully revolted against him at the beginning of his reign. An attempt to reconquer 
2 CONC Egypt in 373 BC was completely unsuccessful, but in his waning years the Persians did manage to defeat a joint Egyptian-Spartan effort tto conquer Phoenicia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Building Projects</p>
2 CONT <p>Much of Artaxerxes's money was spent on building projects – he restored the palace of Darius I at Susa, and also the fortifications – including a strong redoubt at the southeast corner of the e
2 CONC nclosure and gave Ecbatana a new apadana and sculptures. He seems not to have built much at Persepolis.

2 CONT <p>Darius II of Persia</p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius II, originally called Ochus and often surnamed Nothus (from Greek ?????, meaning 'bastard'), was emperor of Persia from 423 BC to 404 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artaxerxes I, who died shortly after December 24, 424 BC, was followed by his son Xerxes II. After a month and a half Xerxes was murdered by his brother Secydianus or Sogdianus (the form of the nam
2 CONC e is uncertain). His illegitimate brother, Ochus, satrap of Hyrcania, rebelled against Sogdianus, and after a short fight killed him, and suppressed by treachery the attempt of his own brother Arsites
2 CONC  to imitate his example. Ochus adopted the name Darius (in the chronicles he is called Nothos, meaning "the bastard"). Neither Xerxes II nor Secydianus occurs in the dates of the numerous Babylonian t
2 CONC ablets from Nippur; here the reign of Darius II follows immediately after that of Artaxerxes I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Of Darius's reign we know very little (a rebellion of the Medes in 409 BC is mentioned in Xenophon), except that he was quite dependent on his wife Parysatis. In the excerpts from Ctesias some hare
2 CONC m intrigues are recorded, in which he played a disreputable part. As long as the power of Athens remained intact he did not meddle in Greek affairs; even the support which the Athenians in 413 BC gave
2 CONC  to the rebel Amorges in Caria would not have roused him, had not the Athenian power been broken in the same year before Syracuse. He gave orders to his satraps in Asia Minor, Tissaphernes and Pharnab
2 CONC azus, to send in the overdue tribute of the Greek towns, and to begin a war with Athens; for this purpose they entered into an alliance with Sparta. In 408 BC he sent his son Cyrus to Asia Minor, to c
2 CONC arry on the war with greater energy. In 404 BC Darius II died after a reign of nineteen years, and was followed by Artaxerxes II.

2 CONT <p>Artaxerxes of Persia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Artaxerxes I of Persia was the fifth king of the Achaemenid Dynasty. His father was the former King Xerxes and he ruled the Persian Empire from 465 B.C. to 425 B.C. which is where he appears on the
2 CONC  Biblical Timeline Chart.  King Xerxes was murdered shortly before King Artaxerxes ascended the throne. The assassin who killed the former king claimed that King Artaxerxes oldest brother Darius told 
2 CONC him to eliminate the king. King Artaxerxes then killed his brother and took over the throne. Most of King Artaxerxes rule was problem free and he didn’t make any major changes to the empire. The cur
2 CONC rent system that was established by the former King Darius proved to be effective for governing the land. The people enjoyed prosperity and peace during his reign because he was able to keep control o
2 CONC f the lands of Persia. Since he kept the system of government in place that was started by King Darius I, he was able to keep a vast network of trade and tribute flowing throughout the empire. He used
2 CONC  the Phoenicians to control overseas trade routes to foreign lands, all of the provinces inside of the Persian Empire had to pay him an annual tribute and he established vast markets that covered the 
2 CONC empire. The religion of Zoroastrianism was popular in Persia and it still remained a viable worship system during the reign of King Artaxerxes. Other Persian gods were worshipped as well. One thing th
2 CONC at all Persian kings did when they conquered a kingdom or empire is allowed the people to continue to worship their gods and King Artaxerxes continued this practice. He was also influenced by the gods
2 CONC  of other nations including the god of the Jewish people. King Artaxerxes acknowledged God in the Bible though he might not have fully worshipped him. Artaxerxes I of Persia Artaxerxes I of Persia Kin
2 CONC g Artaxerxes also had another name known as Longimanus because his right hand was longer than his left one. He had a wife named Stateira who was popular among the people. King Artaxerxes was considere
2 CONC d an extremely kind and good hearted ruler. He always appeared to be fair and just. The king could also deal effectively with his enemies such as Artabanus who conspired to take his throne. King Artax
2 CONC erxes defeated this military commander in a personal duel in front of everybody. One way his kindness was shown was through the decree that he made for the people of Jerusalem. He allowed them to go b
2 CONC ack to their kingdom and assisted them with their journey and the rebuilding of the temple. King Artaxerxes personally knew of Ezra and Nehemiah. He also returned the treasures that taken from the tem
2 CONC ple under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. Some historians trace the demise of the Persian Empire beginning with his reign. A few provinces within his empire tried to rebel, but they did not succeed. They
2 CONC  state that the uprisings that he experienced during his time in power had planted seeds for future revolts and rebellions and it didn’t matter if he put an end to them. Greece was a kingdom that re
2 CONC volted against Persia during his reign and they would come back to defeat the Persians at a future date. The Greeks also encouraged the Egyptians to revolt as well. On the outer fringes of the Persian
2 CONC  Empire, the people were conspiring to rid themselves of Persian domination. Once again King Artaxerxes kept control of the rebellious regions but he didn’t completely or wasn’t able to stop the p
2 CONC eople from conspiring against Persia. King Artaxerxes died in 425 B.C. Biblical References: Ezra 7 King Artaxerxes gives the decree for the Jewish people to return home and he also informs the rest of
2 CONC  his empire to accommodate Jews with their return journey and the rebuilding of the temple. - See more at: http://amazingbibletimeline.com/blog/artaxerxes-of-persia/#sthash.SkTgiuuF.dpuf General Notes

2 CONT <p>He may have been the "Artasyrus" mentioned by Herodotus as being a Satrap of the royal satrapy of Bactria.

2 CONT <p>In Greek sources he is also surnamed μακρόχειρ Macrocheir (Latin: 'Longimanus'), allegedly because his right hand was longer than his left.[4]

2 CONT <p>After Persia had been defeated at Eurymedon, military action between Greece and Persia was at a standstill. When Artaxerxes I took power, he introduced a new Persian strategy of weakening the Athen

2 CONT <p>[edit] Portrayal in the Book of Ezra and NehemiahArtaxerxes (Hebrew: אַרְתַּחְשַׁסְתְּא‎, pronounced [artaχʃast]) commissioned Ezra, a Jewish priest (kohen) and scribe, by mea
2 CONC ns of a letter of decree (see Cyrus's edict), to take charge of the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of the Jewish nation. A copy of this decree may be found in Ezra 7:13-28.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ezra thereby left Babylon in the first month of the seventh year (~ 458 BCE)[6] of Artaxerxes' reign, at the head of a company of Jews that included priests and Levites. They arrived in Jerusalem o
2 CONC n the first day of the fifth month of the seventh year (Hebrew Calendar).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The rebuilding of the Jewish community in Jerusalem had begun under Cyrus the Great, who had permitted Jews held captive in Babylon to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple of Solomon. Consequ
2 CONC ently, a number of Jews returned to Jerusalem in 538 B.C., and the foundation of this "Second Temple" was laid the following year.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Artaxerxes' 20th year (444 BCE),[7] Nehemiah, the king's cupbearer, apparently was also a friend of the king as in that year Artaxerxes inquired after Nehemiah's sadness. Nehemiah related to him
2 CONC  the plight of the Jewish people and that the city of Jerusalem was undefended. The king sent Nehemiah to Jerusalem with letters of safe passage to the governors in Trans-Euphrates, and to Asaph, keep
2 CONC er of the royal forests, to make beams for the citadel by the Temple and to rebuild the city walls.[8]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Interpretations of Artaxerxes actionsRoger Williams, a seventeenth-century Christian minister and founder of Rhode Island, interpreted several passages in the Old and New Testament to suppor
2 CONC t limiting government interference in religious matters. Williams published The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution, describing his analysis of why a civil government should be separate from religion accordi
2 CONC ng to the Bible. Williams believed that Israel was a unique covenant kingdom and not an appropriate model for New Testament Christians who believed that the Old Testament covenant had been fulfilled. 
2 CONC Therefore, the more informative Old Testament examples of civil government were "good" non-covenant kings such as Artaxerxes, who tolerated the Jews and did not insist that they follow his state relig

2 CONC prompted renewed fighting in 450 BC, where the Greeks attacked at the Battle of Cyprus. After Cimon's failure to attain much in this expedition, "The Peace of Callias" was agreed between Athens, Argos
2 CONC  and Persia in 449.

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Archelaus was a son of Perdiccas II by a slave woman. He obtained the throne by murdering his own uncle Alcetas II and cousin Alexander, such that his father became king, and his half-
2 CONC brother, a child of seven years, the legitimate heir.[2] Almost immediately after he took power, Archelaus was faced with a situation which allowed him to completely reverse Macedon's relationship wit
2 CONC h Athens, which had been a major threat for the past half century. The Athenians experienced a crushing defeat at Syracuse in late 413 during which most of their ships were destroyed. This left the At
2 CONC henians in desperate need of a huge amount of timber to build new ships and Archelaus in a position to set the price. Archelaus generously supplied the Athenians with the timber they needed. In recogn
2 CONC ition of this, the Athenians honored Archelaus and his children with the titles of proxenos and euergetes.[3] Archelaus went on to institute many internal reforms. He issued an abundance of good quali
2 CONC ty coinage. He built strongholds, cut straight roads (important for movement of the military), and improved the organization of the military, particularly the cavalry and hoplite infantry. Archelaus w
2 CONC as also known as a man of culture and extended cultural and artistic contacts with southern Greece. In his new palace at Pella (where he moved the capital from the old capital at Aigai), he hosted gre
2 CONC at poets, tragedians, including Agathon and Euripides (who wrote his tragedies Archelaus and The Bacchae while in Macedon), musicians, and painters, including Zeuxis (the most celebrated painter of hi
2 CONC s time).[4] Archelaus reorganized the Olympia, a religious festival with musical and athletic competitions honoring Olympian Zeus and the Muses at Dion, the Olympia of Macedon. The greatest athletes a
2 CONC nd artists of Greece came to Macedon to participate in this event. In addition, Archelaus competed and won in Tethrippon in both Olympic and Pythian Games.[5] According to Aelian, Archelaus was killed
2 CONC  in 399 BC during a hunt, by one of the royal pages, Crateuas.[6] According to Constantine Paparrigopoulos,[7] there were three accomplices: two Thessalians (Crateuas and Ellanokratis) and one Macedon
2 CONC ian, Decamnichos. The latter used to be Archelaus' protégé. However Decamnichos once insulted, in front of Archelaus, the tragic poet Euripides for the smell of the poet's alleged bad breath. This o

2 CONT <p>Xerxes I (Persian Khshayarsha) (circa 519-465 bc), king of Persia (486-465 bc), the son of Darius I and Atossa (flourished 6th century bc), daughter of Cyrus the Great. Ascending the throne upon th
2 CONC e death of his father, he subdued a rebellion in Egypt, and then spent three years preparing a great fleet and army to punish the Greeks for aiding the Ionian cities in 498 bc and for their victory ov
2 CONC er the Persians at Marathon in 490 bc. The Greek historian Herodotus gives as the combined strength of Xerxes’ land and naval forces the incredible total of 2,641,610 warriors, but it was probably b
2 CONC etween 200,000 and 300,000. Xerxes is said to have crossed the Hellespont by a bridge of boats more than a kilometer in length and to have cut a canal through the isthmus of Mount Athos. During the sp
2 CONC ring of 480 bc he marched with his forces through Thrace, Thessaly (Thessalia), and Locris. At Thermopylae 300 Spartans, under their king, Leonidas I, and 1100 other Greeks made a courageous but futil
2 CONC e stand, delaying the Persians for ten days. Xerxes then advanced into Attica and burned Athens, which had been abandoned by the Greeks. At the Battle of Salamís later in 480 bc, however, his fleet w

2 CONT <p>Xerxes I of Persia (English: /ˈzɜrksiːz/; Old Persian: خشایارشا (Ḫšayāršā), IPA: [xʃajaːrʃaː]; also known as Xerxes the Great, was the fourth Zoroastrian king of kings of the A
2 CONC chamenid Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Immediately after seizing the Kingship, Darius I of Persia (son of Hystaspes) married Atossa (daughter of Cyrus the Great). They were both descendants of Achaemenes from different Achaemenid lines.
2 CONC  Marrying a daughter of Cyrus strengthened Darius' position as king. Darius was an active emperor, busy with building programs in Persepolis, Susa, Egypt, and elsewhere. Toward the end of his reign he
2 CONC  moved to punish Athens, but a new revolt in Egypt (probably led by the Persian satrap) had to be suppressed. Under Persian law, the Achaemenian kings were required to choose a successor before settin
2 CONC g out on such serious expeditions. Upon his great decision to leave (487-486 BC), Darius prepared his tomb at Naqsh-e Rostam and appointed Xerxes, his eldest son by Atossa, as his successor. Darius' f
2 CONC ailing health then prevented him from leading the campaigns, and he died in October 486 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Xerxes was not the oldest son of Darius and according to old Iranian traditions should not have succeeded the King. Xerxes was however the oldest son of Darius and Atossa hence descendent of Cyrus.
2 CONC  This made Xerxes the chosen King of Persia. Some modern scholars also view the unusual decision of Darius to give the throne to Xerxes to be a result of his consideration of the unique positions that
2 CONC  Cyrus the Great and his daughter Atossa have had. Artobazan was born to "Darius the subject", while Xerxes was the eldest son born in the purple after Darius' rise to the throne, and Artobazan's moth
2 CONC er was a commoner while Xerxes' mother was the daughter of the founder of the empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Xerxes was crowned and succeeded his father in October-December 486 BC when he was about 36 years old. The transition of power to Xerxes was smooth due again in part to great authority of Atossa an
2 CONC d his accession of royal power was not challenged by any person at court or in the Achaemenian family, or any subject nation.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Almost immediately, he suppressed the revolts in Egypt and Babylon that had broken out the year before, and appointed his brother Achaemenes as governor or satrap (Old Persian: khshathrapavan) over
2 CONC  Egypt. In 484 BC, he outraged the Babylonians by violently confiscating and melting down the golden statue of Bel (Marduk, Merodach), the hands of which the rightful king of Babylon had to clasp each
2 CONC  New Year's Day. This sacrilege led the Babylonians to rebel in 484 BC and 482 BC, so that in contemporary Babylonian documents, Xerxes refused his father's title of King of Babylon, being named rathe
2 CONC r as King of Persia and Media, Great King, King of Kings (Shahanshah) and King of Nations (i.e. of the world).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although Herodotus' report in the Histories has created certain problems concerning Xerxes' religious beliefs, modern scholars consider him as a Zoroastrian.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the year 465 BC Xerxes was murdered by Artabanus, the commander of the royal bodyguard and the most powerful official in Persian court (Hazarapat/commander of thousand). He was promoted to this 
2 CONC most prestigious of positions in Achamenid court after his refusal to help Mardonius in Plataea and instead withdrawing the second Persian army successfully out of Greece. Although he bore the same na
2 CONC me as famed uncle of Xerxes, a Hyrcanian, his rise to prominence was due to his popularity in religious quarters of the court and harem intrigues. He put his seven sons in key positions and had an eff
2 CONC ective master plan to dethrone Achamenids. In August, 465 B.C he assassinated Xerxes with the help of a eunuch Aspamitres. Greek historians give contradicting accounts on the full story. According to 
2 CONC Ctesias (in Persica 20), he then accused the crown prince Darius (Xerxes' eldest son) of the murder; he instigated Artaxerxes (another of Xerxes' son), to avenge the patricide. But according to Aristo
2 CONC tle (in Politics 5.1311b), Artabanus killed Darius first and then the king himself. Later on after discovering what he had done and planned for the royal power, Artabanus together with his sons were k
2 CONC illed by Artaxerxes I. Participating in the scuffles was also general Megabyzus (baghabukhsha) whose side switching probably saved the day for Achamenids.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius left to his son the task of punishing the Athenians, Naxians, and Eretrians for their interference in the Ionian Revolt and their victory over the Persians at Marathon. From 483 BC Xerxes pr
2 CONC epared his expedition: A channel was dug through the isthmus of the peninsula of Mount Athos, provisions were stored in the stations on the road through Thrace, two bridges were built across the Helle
2 CONC spont. Soldiers of many nationalities served in the armies of Xerxes, including the Assyrians, Phoenicians, Babylonians, Indians, Egyptians, Jews, and Arabs.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the Greek historian Herodotus, Xerxes' first attempt to bridge the Hellespont ended in failure when a storm destroyed the flax and papyrus bridge; Xerxes ordered the Hellespont (the st
2 CONC rait itself) whipped three hundred times and had fetters thrown into the water. Xerxes' second attempt to bridge the Hellespont was successful.[15] Xerxes concluded an alliance with Carthage, and thus
2 CONC  deprived Greece of the support of the powerful monarchs of Syracuse and Agrigentum. Many smaller Greek states, moreover, took the side of the Persians, especially Thessaly, Thebes and Argos. Xerxes s
2 CONC et out in the spring of 480 BC from Sardis with a fleet and army which Herodotus claimed was more than two million strong with at least 10,000 elite warriors named Persian Immortals. Xerxes was victor
2 CONC ious during the initial battles.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the Battle of Thermopylae, a small force of Greek warriors led by King Leonidas of Sparta resisted the much larger Persian forces, but were ultimately defeated. According to Herodotus, the Persi
2 CONC ans broke the Spartan phalanx after a Greek man called Ephialtes betrayed his country by telling the Persians of another pass around the mountains. After Thermopylae, Athens was captured and the Athen
2 CONC ians and Spartans were driven back to their last line of defense at the Isthmus of Corinth and in the Saronic Gulf. The delay caused by the Spartans allowed Athens to be evacuated.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>What happened next is a matter of some controversy. According to Herodotus, upon encountering the deserted city, in an uncharacteristic fit of rage particularly for Persian kings, Xerxes had Athens
2 CONC  burned. He almost immediately regretted this action and ordered it rebuilt the very next day[citation needed]. However, Persian scholars dispute this view as pan-Hellenic propaganda [citation needed]
2 CONC , arguing that Sparta, not Athens, was Xerxes' main foe in his Greek campaigns, and that Xerxes would have had nothing to gain by destroying a major center of trade and commerce like Athens once he ha
2 CONC d already captured it.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At that time, anti-Persian sentiment was high among many mainland Greeks, and the rumor that Xerxes had destroyed the city was a popular one, though it is equally likely the fire was started by acc
2 CONC ident as the Athenians were frantically fleeing the scene in pandemonium[citation needed], or that it was an act of "scorched earth" warfare to deprive Xerxes' army of the spoils of the city. Unfortun
2 CONC ately, regardless of the circumstances the damage was done and Xerxes considered the capture of Athens as the only major mistake in his military career.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At Artemisium, large storms had destroyed ships from the Greek side and so the battle stopped prematurely as the Greeks received news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated. Xerxes was induced 
2 CONC by the message of Themistocles (against the advice of Artemisia of Halicarnassus) to attack the Greek fleet under unfavourable conditions, rather than sending a part of his ships to the Peloponnesus a
2 CONC nd awaiting the dissolution of the Greek armies. The Battle of Salamis (September 29, 480 BC) was won by the Greek fleet. Although the loss was a setback, it was not a disaster as some Greek historian
2 CONC s have claimed, and Xerxes set up a winter camp in Thessaly.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Due to unrest in Babylon, Xerxes was forced to send his army home to prevent a revolt, leaving behind an army in Greece under Mardonius, who was defeated the following year at Plataea.[17] The Gree
2 CONC ks also attacked and burned the remaining Persian fleet anchored at Mycale. This cut off the Persians from the supplies they needed to sustain their massive army, and they had no choice but to retreat
2 CONC . Their withdrawal roused the Greek city-states of Asia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the military blunders in Greece, Xerxes returned to Persia and completed the many construction projects left unfinished by his father at Susa and Persepolis. He built the Gate of all Nations 
2 CONC and the Hall of a Hundred Columns at Persepolis, which are the largest and most imposing structures of the palace. He completed the Apadana, the Palace of Darius and the Treasury all started by Darius
2 CONC  as well as building his own palace which was twice the size of his father's. His taste in architecture was similar to that of Darius, though on an even more gigantic scale[18]. He also maintained the
2 CONC  Royal Road built by his father and completed the Susa Gate and built a palace at Susa.[19]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Xerxes is the protagonist of the opera "Serse" by the German-English Baroque composer George Frideric Handel. It was first performed in King's Theatre in London on 15 April 1738.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Later generations' fascination with ancient Sparta, and particularly the Battle of Thermopylae, has led to Xerxes' portrayal in a number of works of popular culture. For instance, he was played by 
2 CONC David Farrar in the 1962 film The 300 Spartans, where he is portrayed as a cruel, power-crazed despot and an inept commander. He also features prominently in the graphic novel 300 by Frank Miller, as 
2 CONC well as the movie adaptation (portrayed by Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Other works dealing with the Persian Empire or the Biblical story of Esther have also referenced Xerxes, such as the video game Assassin's Creed II and the film One Night with the King, in which Ah
2 CONC asueras (Xerxes) was portrayed by British actor Luke Goss. He is the leader of the Persian Empire in the video game Civilization II (along with Scheherazade) and III, although Civilization IV replaces
2 CONC  him with Cyrus the Great.

2 CONT <p>Xerxes the Great was a Persian Emperor (Shahanshah) (reigned 485 BC–465 BC) of the Achaemenid dynasty. Xérxēs (Ξέρξης) is the Greek form of the Old Persian throne name Xšayāršā, meani

2 CONT <p>Xerxes was son of Darius I and Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus the Great. After his accession in October 485 BC he suppressed the revolts in Egypt and Babylon that had broken out in 486 BC and appoin
2 CONC ted his brother Achaemenes as governor or satrap over Egypt (Old Persian: khshathrapavan), bringing Egypt under very strict rule. His predecessors, especially Darius, had not been successful in their 
2 CONC attempts to conciliate the ancient civilizations. This probably was the reason why Xerxes in 484 BC took away from Babylon the golden statue of Bel (Marduk, Merodach), the hands of which the legitimat
2 CONC e king of Babylon had to seize on the first day of each year, and killed the priest who tried to hinder him. Therefore Xerxes does not bear the title of King in the Babylonian documents dated from his
2 CONC  reign, but King of Persia and Media or simply King of countries (i.e. of the world). This proceeding led to two rebellions, probably in 484 BC and 479 BC.

2 CONC  Xerxes was victorious during the initial battles. Xerxes set out in the spring of 480 BC from Sardis with a fleet and army which Herodotus estimated was roughly one million strong along with 10,000 e
2 CONC lite warriors named the Persian Immortals. More recent estimates place the Persian force at around 60,000 combatants[13], although this is disputed: another modern estimate of the Persian invasion for
2 CONC ce is roughly 500,000, with the Persian Empire controlling forty percent of the world's population, more than 100 million people, at that time.[citation needed] Thermopylae and Athens At the Battle of
2 CONC  Thermopylae, a small force of Greek warriors led by King Leonidas of Sparta resisted the much larger Persian forces, but were ultimately defeated. According to Herodotus, the Persians broke the Spart
2 CONC an phalanx after a Greek man called Ephialtes betrayed his country by telling the Persians of another pass around the mountains. After Thermopylae, Athens was captured and the Athenians and Spartans w
2 CONC ere driven back to their last line of defense at the Isthmus of Corinth and in the Saronic Gulf. What happened next is a matter of some controversy. According to Herodotus, upon encountering the deser
2 CONC ted city, in an uncharacteristic fit of rage particularly for Persian kings, Xerxes had Athens burned. He almost immediately regretted this action and ordered it rebuilt the very next day. However, Pe
2 CONC rsian scholars dispute this view as pan-Hellenic propaganda, arguing that Sparta, not Athens, was Xerxes's main foe in his Greek campaigns, and that Xerxes would have had nothing to gain by destroying
2 CONC  a major center of trade and commerce like Athens once he had already captured it. Inscription of Xerxes the Great near the Van Citadel  At that time, anti-Persian sentiment was high among many mainla
2 CONC nd Greeks, and the rumor that Xerxes had destroyed the city was a popular one, though it is equally likely the fire was started by accident as the Athenians were frantically fleeing the scene in pande
2 CONC monium, or that it was an act of "scorched earth" warfare to deprive Xerxes's army of the spoils of the city. At Artemisium, large storms had destroyed ships from the Greek side and so the battle stop
2 CONC ped prematurely as the Greeks received news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated. Xerxes was induced by the message of Themistocles (against the advice of Artemisia of Halicarnassus) to attack t
2 CONC he Greek fleet under unfavourable conditions, rather than sending a part of his ships to the Peloponnesus and awaiting the dissolution of the Greek armies. The Battle of Salamis (September, 480 BC) wa
2 CONC s won by the Greek fleet, after which Xerxes set up a winter camp in Thessaly.[citation needed] Due to unrest in Babylon, Xerxes was forced to send his army home to prevent a revolt, leaving behind an
2 CONC  army in Greece under Mardonius, who was defeated the following year at Plataea.[14] The Greeks also attacked and burned the remaining Persian fleet anchored at Mycale. This cut off the Persians from 
2 CONC the supplies they needed to sustain their massive army, and they had no choice but to retreat. Their withdrawal roused the Greek city-states of Asia. Construction projects The rock-cut tomb at Naqsh-e
2 CONC  Rustam north of Persepolis, copying that of Darius, is usually assumed to be that of Xerxes  After the military blunders in Greece, Xerxes returned to Persia and completed the many construction proje
2 CONC cts left unfinished by his father at Susa and Persepolis. He built the Gate of all Nations and the Hall of a Hundred Columns at Persepolis, which are the largest and most imposing structures of the pa
2 CONC lace. He completed the Apadana, the Palace of Darius and the Treasury all started by Darius as well as building his own palace which was twice the size of his father's. His taste in architecture was s
2 CONC imilar to that of Darius, though on an even more gigantic scale.[15] He also maintained the Royal Road built by his father and completed the Susa Gate and built a palace at Susa.[16] Death In 465 BC, 
2 CONC Xerxes was murdered by Artabanus, the commander of the royal bodyguard and the most powerful official in the Persian court (Hazarapat/commander of thousand). Although Artabanus bore the same name as t
2 CONC he famed uncle of Xerxes, a Hyrcanian, his rise to prominence was due to his popularity in religious quarters of the court and harem intrigues. He put his seven sons in key positions and had a plan to
2 CONC  dethrone the Achamenids.[17] In August 465 BC, Artabanus assassinated Xerxes with the help of a eunuch, Aspamitres. Greek historians give contradicting accounts of events. According to Ctesias (in Pe
2 CONC rsica 20), Artabanus then accused the Crown Prince Darius, Xerxes's eldest son, of the murder and persuaded another of Xerxes's sons, Artaxerxes, to avenge the patricide by killing Darius. But accordi
2 CONC ng to Aristotle (in Politics 5.1311b), Artabanus killed Darius first and then killed Xerxes. After Artaxerxes discovered the murder he killed Artabanus and his sons.[18] Participating in these intrigu

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Xerxes I (?????????), was a Persian king (reigned 485 - 465 BC) of the Achaemenid dynasty. "Xerxes" is the Greek transliteration of the Persian throne name Khshayarsha or Khsha-yar-shan, meaning "r
2 CONC uler of heroes". In the Hebrew Bible, the Persian king ?????? A?ashverosh (Ahasuerus in Greek) probably corresponds to Xerxes I.

2 CONT <p>Political Career</p>
2 CONT <p>Xerxes I The Great, son of Darius I The Great and Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus the Great, he was appointed successor to his father in preference to his elder half-brothers, who were born before Da
2 CONC rius had become king. After his accession in October 485 BC he suppressed the revolt in Egypt which had broken out in 486 BC, appointed his brother Achaemenes as henchman (or khshathrapavan, satrap) b
2 CONC ringing Egypt under a very strict rule. His predecessors, especially Darius, had not been successful in their attempts to conciliate the ancient civilizations. This probably was the reason why Xerxes 
2 CONC in 484 BC abolished the Kingdom of Babel and took away the golden statue of Bel (Marduk, Merodach), the hands of which the legitimate king of Babel had to seize on the first day of each year, and kill
2 CONC ed the priest who tried to hinder him. Therefore Xerxes does not bear the title of King of Babel in the Babylonian documents dated from his reign, but King of Persia and Media or simply King of countr
2 CONC ies (i.e. of the world). This proceeding led to two rebellions, probably in 484 BC and 479 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius had left to his son the task of punishing the Athenians for their interference in the Ionian rebellion and the victory of Marathon. From 483 Xerxes prepared his expedition with great care: a
2 CONC  channel was dug through the isthmus of the peninsula of Mount Athos; provisions were stored in the stations on the road through Thrace; two bridges were thrown across the Hellespont. Xerxes concluded
2 CONC  an alliance with Carthage, and thus deprived Greece of the support of the powerful monarchs of Syracuse and Agrigentum. Many smaller Greek states, moreover, took the side of the Persians, especially 
2 CONC Thessaly, Thebes and Argos. A large fleet and a numerous army (some have claimed that there were over 2,000,000) were gathered. In the spring of 480 Xerxes set out from Sardis. At first Xerxes was vic
2 CONC torious everywhere. The Greek fleet was beaten at Artemisium, Thermopylae stormed, Athens conquered, the Athenians with Sparta driven back to their last line of defence at the Isthmus of Corinth and i
2 CONC n the Saronic Gulf. But Xerxes was induced by the astute message of Themistocles (against the advice of Artemisia of Halicarnassus) to attack the Greek fleet under unfavourable conditions, instead of 
2 CONC sending a part of his ships to the Peloponnesus and awaiting the dissolution of the Greek armament. The Battle of Salamis (September 28, 480) was won by the Athenians, but the war as whole was Xerxes 
2 CONC victory. Having lost his communication by sea with Asia, Xerxes was forced to retire to Sardis; the army which he left in Greece under Mardonius was in 479 beaten at Plataea. The defeat of the Persian
2 CONC s at Mycale roused the Greek cities of Asia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Battle at Athens wich Xerxes commanded, is usually mistaken as a battle between greeks and Persians, rather the truth is that Xerxes went to punish the Athenians for the looting and destruction
2 CONC  of greek cities in Anatolia, wich was under Persian control. He had the help of other greek cities and Macedonia in his campaign. Xerxes took Athens, and after a short period of time left, as it was 
2 CONC not in his intrest to take the city rather too punish the officials for previous war against other greek cities in Persian territory. The important thing we must remember in history is that the Persia
2 CONC ns never fought with Greece, but with inndividual, and often allied greek states (cities) as Greece was never a united country but divided in bickering provinces (cities) which on occasions untied to 
2 CONC fight the Persians. The Persians themselves had greek cities as allies, for instance the ones in the Anatolian region wich the athenians warred with and led to the subsequent punishment by Xerxes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Missing Later Years</p>
2 CONT <p>Of the later years of Xerxes little is known. He sent out Satapes to attempt the circumnavigation of Africa, but the victory of the Greeks threw the empire into a state of slow apathy, from which i
2 CONC t could not rise again. The king himself became involved in intrigues of the harem and was much dependent upon courtiers and eunuchs. He left inscriptions at Persepolis, where he added a new palace to
2 CONC  that of Darius, at Van in Armenia, and on Mount Elvend near Ecbatana. In these texts he merely copies the words of his father. In 465 he was murdered by his vizier Artabanus who raised Artaxerxes I t
2 CONC o the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>In the Bible</p>
2 CONT <p>In the Bible, in the Book of Ezra, Xerxes I is mentioned by the name of ?????? A?ashverosh (Ahasuerus in Greek). It is noted that, during his reign, as in the reign of his predecessor Darius and hi
2 CONC s successor Artaxerxes, the Samaritans wrote to the Persian king full of accusations against the Jews.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ahasuerus also appears as the King in the Book of Esther, and is traditionally identified with Xerxes. In the story told in this Biblical book, Ahasuerus dismisses his Queen consort Vashti and then
2 CONC  chooses the Jewess Esther as his queen. The king's minister Haman, feeling insulted by Esther's cousin Mordecai, convinces Ahasuerus to decree the destruction of all the Jews in the Persian Empire, b
2 CONC ut Mordecai and Esther manage to reverse their fate through their influence with the King.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The works of Josephus suggest that Vashti and Esther existed. However, the works of Herodotus, suggest that Xerxes had a Queen consort named Amestris, daughter to Otanes.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Perdiccas II of Macedon</p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Perdiccas II (Greek: ?e?d??a?) was king of Macedon ia from about 454 BC to about 413 BC. He was the son of Alexander I. After the death of Alexander in 452, Macedonia began to fall apart. Macedonia
2 CONC n tribes became almost completely autonomous, and were only loosely allied to the king. By 434, Perdiccas' brother, Philip, had challenged Pediccas for the throne, and enlisted the support of Athens a
2 CONC nd king Derdas of Elimea. Perdiccas responded by stirring up rebellion in a number of Athenian tribute cities, including Potidaea. Athens responded with force, and sent 1000 hoplites and 30 ships to M
2 CONC acedonia where they captured Therme. They went on to besiege Pydna, where they were met by reinforcements of a further 2000 hoplites and 40 ships. However, as the Athenians were besieging Pydna, they 
2 CONC received news that Corinth had sent a force of 1600 hoplites and 400 light troops to support Poteidaia. In order to combat this new threat, Athens made an alliance with Perdiccas, and proceeded to Pot
2 CONC eidaia. Perdiccas immediately broke the treaty and marched to Poteidaia, where the Athenians were victorious.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 431, Athens entered into an alliance with King Sitalkes of Thrace, after Nymphodorus, an Athenian, married Sitalkes’ sister. Nymphodorus then negotiated an agreement between Athens and Perdicc
2 CONC as, where Perdiccas regained Therme. As a result of this, Athens withdrew her support for Philip, and the Thracians promised to assist Perdiccas in capturing him. In return, Perdiccas marched on the C
2 CONC halcidians, the people he had originally persuaded to revolt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, Perdiccas once again betrayed the Athenians and sent 1000 troops to support a Spartan assault on Acarnania in 429 but they arrived too late to help (Thucydides 2.80). In response to this, 
2 CONC Sitalkes invaded Macedonia with the promise of support from Athens. This support never materialized, and Perdiccas once again used diplomacy to ensure the survival of Macedonia. He promised the hand o
2 CONC f his sister in marriage to the nephew of Sitalkes, who then persuaded Sitalkes to leave.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After this altercation, Perdiccas was allied to the Spartans and, in 424, helped the Spartan Brasidas to take Amphipolis from the Athenians, one of her most important colonies, mainly for its ready
2 CONC  access to timber for her fleets. This was a severe blow to Athens, and would tie them to Macedonian timber for years to come, which strengthened Macedonia’s bargaining power considerably. In return
2 CONC  for this, the Spartans helped Perdiccas secure his borders, by leading an assault on king Arrhabaeus of Lyncus, with the promise of support from the Illyrians. However, the Illyrians switched sides a
2 CONC nd attacked Perdiccas and his Spartan allies. The poorly trained Macedonian troops fled, and so the Spartans also retreated and attacked the Macedonian baggage train in anger. This soured relations be
2 CONC tween Macedonia and the Peloponnese for years to come, and pushed Perdiccas closer to Athens, allying himself with them in 423/2.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By 417, Perdiccas had left the Athenians and joined the Spartan-Argive alliance. Just four years later, bowing to Athenian pressure, Perdiccas broke with the Peloponnese, and aided Athens in their 
2 CONC attack on Amphipolis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 413 BC he died and left his son Archelaus as king.</p>

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius I, titled "Darius the Great," was the third king of kings of the Achaemenid Empire. Darius held the empire at its peak, then including Egypt, and parts of Greece. The decay and downfall of t
2 CONC he empire commenced with his death and the coronation of his son, Xerxes I.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius ascended the throne by assassinating the alleged usurper Gaumata with the assistance of six other Persian noble families; Darius was crowned the following morning. The new emperor met with r
2 CONC ebellions throughout his kingdom, and quelled them each time. A major event in Darius' life was his expedition to punish Athens and Eretria and subjugate Greece (an attempt which failed). Darius expan
2 CONC ded his empire by conquering Thrace and Macedon, and invading the Saka, Iranian tribes who had invaded Medes even killed Cyrus the Great. [2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius organized the empire, by dividing it into provinces and placing governors to govern it. He organized a new monetary system, along with making Aramaic the official language of the empire. Dar
2 CONC ius also worked on construction projects throughout the empire, focusing on Susa, Babylon, and Egypt. Darius created a codification of laws for Egypt. He also carved the cliff-face Behistun Inscriptio
2 CONC n, an autobiography of great modern linguistic significance.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on Mount Behistun which was written in Elamite, Old Persian and Babylonian between his coronation and his death. The inscription first gives a brief auto
2 CONC biography of Darius with his ancestry and lineage. To expand on his ancestry, Darius left a sequence of events that occurred after the death of Cyrus the Great. Darius mentions several times that he i
2 CONC s the rightful emperor by the grace of Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian God. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, including a fragmentary Old Iranian inscription from 
2 CONC Gherla, Rumania (Harmatta), and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Herodotus, a Greek historian and author of The Histories, provided an account of many Iranian emperors and of the Greco-Iranian Wars. He wrote extensively of Darius. The story of Darius spans half 
2 CONC of book 3, along with books 4, 5 and 6; it begins with removal of the alleged usurper Gaumata and continues to the end of Darius's reign. After his death.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Book of Ezra (chapter 6, verse 1) describes the adoption and precise instructions to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. It was completed and inaugurated of the sixth year of Darius (March 515 BCE
2 CONC ), as also related in the Book of Ezra (chapter 6, verse 15), so the 70-year prophecy of Jeremiah was fulfilled. Between Cyrus and Darius, an exchange of letters with King Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes is 
2 CONC described (Chapter 4, Verse 7), the grandson of Darius I, in whose reign Ezra and Nehemiah came to Jerusalem. The generous funding of the temple gave Darius and his successors the support of the Jewis
2 CONC h priesthood.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There is mention of a Darius in the Book of Daniel, identified as Darius the Mede. He began ruling when he was 62 years old (chapter 5, verse 31), appointed 120 satraps to govern over their provinc
2 CONC es or districts (chapter 6, verse 1), was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans (chapter 9, verse 1), and predated Cyrus (chapter 11, verse 1). Therefore, many scholars identify him with Cyaxares 
2 CONC II rather than Darius I of Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius was born as the eldest son to Hystaspes and Rhodugune in 550 BCE. Hystaspes was a leading figure of authority in Persis which was the homeland of the Persians. Darius' inscription states tha
2 CONC t his father was satrap of Bactria in 522 BCE. According to Herodotus, Hystaspes was satrap of Persis, although this is considered to be an error by most historians. Also according to Herodotus (III.1
2 CONC 39), Darius, prior to seizing power and "of no consequence at the time", had served as a spearman (doryphoros) in the Egyptian campaign (528–525 BCE) of Cambyses II, then the Persian emperor.[6]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The rise of Darius to the throne contains two different sides to the story. Our sources (the Bisitun inscription and Herodotus) both give similar stories (below). However, historians have inferred 
2 CONC from these that Darius' rise to power may have been illegitimate. It seems likely that 'Gaumata' was in fact Bardiya, and that under cover of revolts, Darius killed the heir to the throne and took it 
2 CONC himself. The fact that Darius' father and grandfather are still alive (Bisitun Inscription) implies that he was not the next in line to a hereditary throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The account of Darius which is written at the Behistun Inscription states that Cambyses II killed his own brother Bardiya, but that this murder was not known among the Iranian people. A would-be us
2 CONC urper named Gaumata came and lied to the people, stating he was Bardiya.[8] The Iranians had grown rebellious against Cambyses' rule, and on 11 March 522 BCE, a revolt against Cambyses broke out, in h
2 CONC is absence.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On 1 July, the Iranian people chose to be under the leadership of Gaumata, as "Bardiya". No member of the Achamenid family would rise against Gaumata for the safety of their own life. Darius, who h
2 CONC ad served Cambyses as his lance-bearer until the deposed ruler's death, prayed for aid, and in September 522 BCE, he along with Otanes, Intraphrenes, Gobryas, Hydarnes, Megabyxus and Aspathines killed
2 CONC  Gaumata in the fortress of Sikayauvati. Darius was proclaimed emperor.[8]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Greek historians</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the accounts of Greek historians, Cambyses II had left Patizeithes in charge of the kingdom when he headed for Egypt. He later sent Prexaspes to murder Bardiya. After the killing, Pati
2 CONC zeithes put his brother Gaumata, a Magian who resembled Bardiya, on the throne and declared him the emperor. Otanes discovered that Gaumata was an impostor, and along with six other Iranian nobles inc
2 CONC luding Darius, created a plan to oust the pseudo-Bardiya. After killing the impostor along with his brother Patizeithes and other Magians, Darius was crowned emperor the following morning.[2]

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Babylonian revolt</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Bardiya was murdered, widespread revolts occurred throughout the empire, especially on the eastern side. Darius asserted his position as emperor by force, taking his armies throughout the emp
2 CONC ire, supressing each revolt individually. The most notable of all the revolts is the Babylonian revolt which was led by Nebuchadnezzar III. This revolt occurred when Otanes had taken a large amount of
2 CONC  the army out of Babylon to aid Darius in suppressing other revolts. Darius felt that the Babylonian had taken advantage of him and deceived him, which resulted in Darius gathering up a large army and
2 CONC  marching to Babylon. At Babylon, Darius was met with closed gates and a series of defences to keep him and his armies out of Babylon. [9]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius encountered mockey and taunting from the rebels, including the famous saying "Oh yes, you will capture our city, when mules shall have foals." For 1 and half years, Darius and his armies wer
2 CONC e inable to capture Babylon. Darius had attempted many tricks and strategies, even copying the method that Cyrus the Great had utilized when he had captured Babylon. However, the situation changed in 
2 CONC the favor of Darius, when one of the mules of Zopyrus foaled. At the time, it was believed to be a great miracle and an act of God. Following this, a plan was created for a high ranking soldier to pre
2 CONC tend to be a deserter to enter the Babylonian camp and gain the trust of the Babylonians. The plan was successful and the Persians eventually surrouned the city and were able to conquer the rebels.[10
2 CONC ]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During this revolt, Scythian nomads took advantage of the disorder and chaos and invaded southern Persia. Darius first finished defeating the rebels in Elam, Assyria and Babylon, which he followed 
2 CONC up with an attack agaisnt the invaders. Darius pursued the invaders who led him to a marsh, where he found no known enemies but an enigmatic Scythian tribe distinguishable by their large pointed hats.
2 CONC [11] Even though, Darius' campaign agaisnt the Scythians would more the most part end in failure, he would soon attain larger, greater successess with his escapades and campaigns in Europe.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius's European expedition was a major event in his reign. Starting with the Scythians, Darius conquered Scythia, Thrace and many cities of the northern Aegean, while Macedonia submitted voluntar
2 CONC ily. The Asiatic Greeks and Greek islands had submitted to Persian rule by 510 BCE. They were being governed by tyrants responsible to Darius.[13]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nonetheless, there were certain Greeks who were pro-Persian, such as the Medizing Greeks, which were largely grouped at Athens. This improved Greek-Persian relations as Darius opened his court and 
2 CONC treasuries to the Greeks who wanted to serve him. These Greeks served as soldiers, artisans, statesmen and mariners for Darius. However, Greek fear of the Persians becoming very strong and the constan
2 CONC t interference by the Greeks in Ionia and Lydia were all stepping stones in the conflict that was yet to come between Persia and Greece.[13]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Aristagoras organized the Ionian revolt, Eretria and Athens supported him by sending ships to Ionia and burning Sardis. Persian military and naval operations to quell the revolt ended in the P
2 CONC ersian reoccupation of Ionian and Greek islands. However, anti-Persian parties gained more power in Athens, and pro-Persian aristocrats were exiled from Athens and Sparta. Darius responded by sending 
2 CONC a group of troops led by his son-in-law across the Hellespont. However, the battle was lost due to a violent storm and harassment by Thracians.[13]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Determined to punish Athens, Darius sent a second army consisting of 20,000 men under Datis who captured Eretria and moved onwards to Marathon. In 490, at the Battle of Marathon, the Persians were 
2 CONC defeated by a heavily armed Athenian army with 9,000 men who were supported by 600 Plataeans and 10,000 lightly armed soldiers led by Miltiades. The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the First Pers
2 CONC ian invasion of Greece.[13]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After becoming aware of the Persian defeat at the Battle of Marathon, Darius began planning another expedition against the Greek-city states, this time he would command his armies, rather than Dati
2 CONC s. Darius spent three years preparing armies and ships for the war, when a revolt broke out in Egypt. This revolt in Egypt worsened his failing health and prevented the possibility of sending another 
2 CONC army himself. In October 486 BCE, Darius was embalmed and entombed in the rock-cut sepulcher which had been prepared for him several years earlier. Xerxes, the eldest son of Darius and Atossa was the 
2 CONC successor of Darius and acceded to the throne as Xerxes I. However, prior to Xerxes's accession, Xerxes fought for the right to the throne with his elder half-brother Artobazan, Darius' oldest son who
2 CONC  was born to his commoner first wife before Darius rose to power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Early in his reign, Darius wanted to organize the loosely organized empire with a system of taxation which had been passed down to him from Cyrus and Cambyses. To do this, Darius created twenty pro
2 CONC vinces called satrapies (or archi) which were each assigned to a satrap (archon) and specified fixed tributes that the satrapies were required to pay. A complete list is preserved in the catalog of He
2 CONC rodotus, beginning from Ionia and listing the other satrapies from west to east excluding Persis which was the land of the Persians and the only province which was not a conquered land. Tributes were 
2 CONC paid in both silver and gold talents. The tributes from each satrap that were paid in silver were measured with the Babylonian talent, and those paid in gold were measured with the Euboic talent. The 
2 CONC total tribute from the satraps came to a number less than 15,000 silver talents.[15]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The majority of the satraps were of Persian origin and were members of the royal house or the six great noble families. These satraps were personally picked by Darius to monitor these provinces, wh
2 CONC ich were divided into sub-provinces with their own governors which were chosen either by the royal court or by the satrap. The assessment of the tribute was accomplished by Darius sending a commission
2 CONC  of men to evaluate the expenses and revenues of each satrap. To ensure that one person did not gain too much power, each satrap had a secretary who observed the affairs of the state and communicated 
2 CONC with Darius, a treasurer who safeguarded provincial revenues, and a garrison commander who was responsible for the troops. Additionally, royal inspectors who were the "eyes and ears" of Darius complet
2 CONC ed further checks over each satrap.[16]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There were headquarters of imperial administration at Persepolis, Susa, and Babylon while Bactria, Ecbatana, Sardis, Dascyclium and Memphis also had branches of imperial administration. Darius chos
2 CONC e Aramaic as a common language, which soon spread throughout the empire. However, Darius gathered a group of scholars to create a separate language system only used for Persis and the Persians, which 
2 CONC was called Aryan script which was only used during official inscriptions.[16]

2 CONT <p>Economy</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before 500 BCE, Darius had introduced a new monetary system which was based on silver coins with a weight averaging to be around 8g and gold coins averaging to be 5.40 g. The gold coin was called d
2 CONC ārayaka and was probably named after Darius. In order to improve trade, Darius built canals, underground waterways, and a powerful navy. He further improved the network of roads and way stations thro
2 CONC ughout the empire, so that there was a system of travel authorization by King, satrap, or other high official, which entitled the traveler to draw provisions at daily stopping places.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius was an adherent of Zoroastrianism and believed that Ahura Mazda had appointed him to rule the Persian Empire. At inscriptions, such as the Behistun Inscription, he mentions that he believes 
2 CONC he is chosen by Ahura Mazda to be the emperor. Darius had dualistic convictions and believed that each rebellion in his kingdom was the work of Drug, the enemy of Asha. Darius believed that because he
2 CONC  lived righteously by Asha, Ahura Mazda supported him. [18] In many cuneiform inscriptions denoting his achievements, he presents himself a devout believer perhaps even convinced that he had a divine 
2 CONC right to rule over the world. [19]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the lands that were conquered by the Persian Empire, Darius followed the same Achaemenid tolerance that Cyrus had shown, and later Achaemenid emperors would show. He supported faiths and religio
2 CONC ns that were "alien" as long as the adherents were submissive and peaceable, sometimes giving them grants from his treasury for their purposes. [20] He had funded the restoration of the Jewish temple 
2 CONC which had originally been decreed by Cyrus the Great, presented favour towards Greek cults which can be seen in his letter to Gadatas, and supported Elamite priests. He had also observed Egyptian reli
2 CONC gious rites related to kingship and had built the temple for the Egyptian God, Amun.[21]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During Darius's Greek expedition, he had taken on building programs in Susa, Egypt and Persepolis. He had linked the Red Sea to the river Nile by building a canal which ran from modern Zaqāzīq to
2 CONC  modern Suez. To open this canal, he traveled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was done among great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built a canal to connect the Red Sea and Mediterrane
2 CONC an. [14][22] On this visit to Egypt, he erected monuments and executed Aryandes on the accounts of treason. When Darius returned back to Persis, he found that the codification of Egyptian law had been
2 CONC  finished.[13]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Additionally, Darius sponsored large construction projects in Susa, Babylon, Egypt, and Persepolis. The monuments that Darius built were often inscribed in the official languages of the Persian Emp
2 CONC ire, which were Old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian and Egyptian hieroglyphs. To construct these monuments, Darius had hired a large number of workers and artisans of diverse nationalities. Several of th
2 CONC ese workers were deportees who had been employed specifically for these projects. These deportees enhanced the economy and improved international relations with neighboring countries that these deport
2 CONC ees arrived from.[16]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the period of Darius's death, construction projects were still underway. Xerxes completed these works and in some cases expanded his father's projects by erecting new buildings of his own.

2 CONT <p>Dareios I (grekisk form av persiska Darayavahush) var en persisk kung som var gift med Atossa. Han gjorde sig mest känd för att ha skapat det persiska rikets organisation. Persien indelades i tju
2 CONC go områden, satrapier, med en ståthållare (satrap) i ledningen. Ett skatteväsen inrättades, man byggde vägar, inrättade en kejserlig postlinje och präglade guldmynt. Satrapierna hade visst sj�
2 CONC �lvstyre, men lämnade soldater till den likaledes upporganiserade armén.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Persien hade redan under Kyros (Kurash) utvidgats österut mot Indien, liksom mot Egypten, men Dareios hade nu sina blickar västerut. Han skickade trupper mot skyterna 513 f Kr och trängde in i B
2 CONC alkan, men lyckades inte riktigt. Grekerna hade sedan länge en rad kolonistäder längs Mindre Asiens kust, kallat Jonien, den mest kända Miletos (på grund av de filosofer som var verksamma där, s
2 CONC åsom Thales. 499 gjorde dessa städer, ledda av Miletos, uppror mot perserna. De vägrades hjälp av Sparta men fick i stället understöd av Athen och Eritrea. Efter vissa inledande framgångar vann
2 CONC  dock perserna kriget om Jonien. Invånarna i Miletos lär ha sålts som slavar och staden brändes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Två år senare skickades en flotta för att straffa Athen och Eritrea. Den förstördes av en storm, men samtidigt erövrades området norr om Grekland. Makedonien blev en persisk satrap (för en 
2 CONC tid). Två år senare, 490 f Kr landade en ny persisk expeditionsstyrka på Attikas kust vid Marathon. De numerärt överlägsna perserna besegrades här av en samlad grekisk styrka ledd av Miltiades.
2 CONC  Detta var inledningen till perserkrigen, där grekerna ledda av Athen förhindrade den persiska övermaktens försök att krossa den gryende athenska demokratin och därmed den västerländska senare
2 CONC  utvecklingen. Se Xerxes I.

2 CONT <p>Many building projects were started during the reign of Darius, the largest being the building of the new capital of Persepolis. Pasargadae was too well associated with the previous dynasty of Cyru
2 CONC s and Cambyses and so Darius sought a new capital. The city would have walls sixty feet high and thirty-three feet thick and would be an enormous engineering undertaking. Darius' tomb was cut into a r
2 CONC ock face not far from the city. He dug a canal from the Nile to Suez, and, as the fragments of a hieroglyphic inscription found there show, his ships sailed from the Nile through the Red Sea by Saba t
2 CONC o Persia. Darius also commissioned the extensive road network that was built all over the country. The Persepolis Tablets mention a ‘royal road’ from Susa to Persepolis and from Sardis to Susa bui
2 CONC lt by Darius. It was highly organised with rest stations, guarded garrisons, inns and apparently no bandits. Darius is also remembered for his Behistun Inscription which was chiselled into the rock fa
2 CONC ce near the town of Behistun. It showed Darius' successful ascension to the throne and described Darius' legitimacy to be king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>About 512 BC Darius undertook a war against the Scythians. A great army crossed the Bosporus, subjugated eastern Thrace, Macedonia submitted voluntarily, and crossed the Danube. The purpose of this
2 CONC  war can only have been to attack the nomadic tribes in the rear and thus to secure peace on the northern frontier of the empire. Yet the whole plan was based upon an incorrect geographical assumption
2 CONC ; a common one in that era, and repeated by Alexander the Great and his Macedonians, who believed that on the Hindu Kush (which they called the Caucasus Indicus) and on the shores of the Jaxartes (whi
2 CONC ch they called Tanais, i.e., the River Don) they were quite near to the Black Sea. Of course the expedition undertaken on these grounds could only prove a failure; having advanced for some weeks into 
2 CONC the steppes of Ukraine, Darius was forced to return. The details given by Herodotus (according to him, Darius had reached the Volga) are quite fantastic; and the account which Darius himself had given
2 CONC  on a tablet, which was added to his great inscription in Behistun, is destroyed with the exception of a few words.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the time, European Greece was intimately connected with the Greek cities on the coast of Asia Minor and as a result Athens and Eretria gave support to the Ionian Revolt against the Persians. Onc
2 CONC e the rebellion was put down, the Persians attempted to punish Athens and European Greece for meddling in the rebellion. But the first expedition, that of Mardonius, failed on the cliffs of Mount Atho
2 CONC s (492 BC), and the army which was led into Attica by Datis in 490 BC was beaten at the Battle of Marathon. Before Darius had finished his preparations for a third expedition an insurrection broke out
2 CONC  in Egypt (486 BC). In the next year Darius died, probably in October 485 BC, after a reign of thirty-six years.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius is often renowned above all as being a great financier. He fixed the coinage and introduced the golden Daric. He developed commerce within the empire and trade without. For example, he sent 
2 CONC an expedition down the Kabul and Indus Rivers, led by the Carian captain Scylax of Caryanda, who explored the Indian Ocean from the mouth of the Indus to Suez. During his reign, the population increas
2 CONC ed and industries flourished in towns.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Persia under Darius probably had connections with Carthage (cf. the Karka of the Nakshi Rustam inscription) of Sicily and Italy. At the same time he attempted to gain the good-will of the subject n
2 CONC ations, and for this purpose promoted the aims of their priests. He allowed the Jews to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem and it was finished in 516 BCE, his sixth year. In Egypt his name appears on the
2 CONC  temples which he built in Memphis, Edfu and the Great Oasis. He called the high-priest of Sais, Tzahor, to Susa (as we learn from his inscription in the Vatican Museum), and gave him full powers to r
2 CONC eorganize the "house of life," the great medical school of the temple of Sais. In the Egyptian traditions he is considered one of the great benefactors and lawgivers of the country. In similar relatio
2 CONC ns he stood to the Greek sanctuaries (cf. his rescript to "his slave" Godatas, the inspector of a royal park near Magnesia on the Maeander, in which he grants freedom of taxes and forced labor to the 
2 CONC sacred territory of Apollo); all the Greek oracles in Asia Minor and Europe therefore stood on the side of Persia in the Persian Wars and admonished the Greeks against attempting resistance.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Weights and measures were standardized (as in a "royal cubit" or a "king’s measure") but often they still operated side by side with their Egyptian or Babylonian counterparts. This would have bee
2 CONC n a boon for merchants and traders as trade would now have been far simpler. The upgraded communication and administration networks also helped to turn the Empire ruled by the Achaemenid dynasty into 
2 CONC a seemingly commercial entity based on generating wealth.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius also continued the process of religious tolerance to his subjects, which had been important parts of the reigns of Cyrus and Cambyses. Darius himself was likely monotheistic - in royal inscr
2 CONC iptions Ahuramazda is the only god mentioned by name. But, time and again he is mentioned worshipping, funding or giving 'lip-service' to various pantheons of gods. This was important as the majority 
2 CONC of the empire's inhabitants were polytheists. Also, like many other Persian Kings, he maintained a no-slave policy; for example, all workers at the Persepolis site and other sites made for him were pa
2 CONC id, which was revolutionary at the time. His human rights policies were also common to his ancestors and future Persian kings, continuing the legacy of the first human rights document ever made.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius I, called The Great (558?-486 bc), king of Persia (521?-486 bc),</p>
2 CONT <p>son of the Persian noble Hystaspes (588-521 bc), and a member of a royal
2 CONT <p>Persian family, the Achaemenids. In 522 bc, on the death of King Cambyses
2 CONT <p>II, a group of Magian priests tried to give the throne to one of their</p>
2 CONT <p>number, the usurper Gaumata; he pretended to be Smerdis (died about 523</p>
2 CONT <p>bc), the murdered brother of Cambyses II. In 521, Darius defeated Gaumata
2 CONT <p>and was chosen king of Persia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The first two years of his reign were occupied with suppressing</p>
2 CONT <p>rebellions, the most important of which occurred in Babylonia. Thereafter
2 CONT <p>he devoted himself to reforming the internal organization of Persia and</p>
2 CONT <p>making its outer borders secure. He reorganized the vast empire into 20</p>
2 CONT <p>satrapies, built highways, organized a postal system, reformed the</p>
2 CONT <p>currency, encouraged commerce, and won the goodwill of large portions of
2 CONT <p>the heterogeneous population. Because he respected their religions, he was
2 CONT <p>honored by the Jews, whom he permitted to complete the rebuilding of the
2 CONT <p>Temple at Jerusalem in 516; by the Egyptians, whose high priest he</p>
2 CONT <p>consulted; and by the Greeks of Asia Minor, whose oracles supported him</p>
2 CONT <p>during the revolt of the Greek cities.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In protecting the borders of the empire, Darius conquered new territories
2 CONT <p>along the Indus River in the east and in the Caucasus Mountains in the</p>
2 CONT <p>northeast, but his expedition in 516 against the tribes of the Danube</p>
2 CONT <p>River failed. In 499 a revolt broke out among the Ionian Greek cities of
2 CONT <p>Asia Minor, partly encouraged by some of the Greek cities on the mainland.
2 CONT <p>The revolt was suppressed by 493, and Darius prepared to punish the</p>
2 CONT <p>mainland Greeks for their intervention. In 492 an army under Mardonius</p>
2 CONT <p>(flourished 500-479 bc), the son-in-law of Darius, crossed the Bosporus</p>
2 CONT <p>into Thrace but was unable to reach Greece because the supply ships were
2 CONT <p>wrecked off Mount Athos. Two years later, a strong Persian force under the
2 CONT <p>joint command of Artaphernes (flourished 5th century bc), a nephew of</p>
2 CONT <p>Darius, and the Mede commander Datis (flourished 5th century bc) invaded
2 CONT <p>Greece from the north but was defeated at Marathon. A third expedition was
2 CONT <p>being prepared when Darius died. He left a detailed account of his reign,
2 CONT <p>inscribed in three languages on a towering rock. This Behistun</p>
2 CONT <p>Inscription, the first English transcription of which was complete in</p>
2 CONT <p>1849, confirms many details of the life of Darius.</p>

2 CONT <p>Sources for Darius' biography</p>
2 CONT <p>The principal sources for the life of Darius are his own inscriptions, especially the great inscription of Behistun, in which he relates how he gained the crown and quelled many rebellions. In mode
2 CONC rn times his veracity has often been doubted, but without any sufficient reason or suggestion of alternatives. The accounts given later by Herodotus and Ctesias of his accession are in many points evi
2 CONC dently dependent on this official version, with many legendary stories interwoven, e.g., the tale that Darius and his allies left the question as to which of them should become king to the decision of
2 CONC  their horses, and that Darius won the crown by a trick of his groom. The official propaganda of the Persian inscriptions and the bias of the Greek writers means that sources regarding Darius need to 
2 CONC be carefully examined.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Rise to power</p>
2 CONT <p>Darius belonged to a cadet branch of the Achaemenid dynasty. A relative of Cambyses, Darius belonged to one of the high-ranking Persian families that made up the nobility of the Persian Empire. Whe
2 CONC n, after the suicide of Cambyses II (March 522 BC), the usurper Gaumata ruled undisturbed over the whole empire under the name of Bardiya (Smerdis), son of Cyrus, no one dared to gainsay him. None, th
2 CONC at is, except Darius. Darius, "with the help of Ahuramazda", attempted to regain the kingdom for the royal family. His father Hystaspes was still alive, but evidently had not the courage to urge his c
2 CONC laims. Actually, according to his inscription found at Susa, both Darius's father Hystaspes and his grandfather Arsames, were alive when he became king. Assisted by six noble Persians, whose names he 
2 CONC proclaims at the end of the Behistun inscription, he surprised and killed the usurper in a Median fortress (October 521), and gained the crown. He also married Atossa, the widow of the false Smerdis a
2 CONC nd daughter of King Cyrus the Great. In time, Xerxes, Darius's son by Atossa, would succeed his father on the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This sudden change in the central authority was perceived by the rulers of the eastern provinces as an opportunity to regain their independence. In Susiana, Babylon, Media, Sagartia, and Margiana, 
2 CONC usurpers arose, pretending to be of the old royal race, and gathered large armies around them; in Persia itself Vahyazdata imitated the example of Gaumata and was acknowledged by the majority of the p
2 CONC eople as the true Bardiya. Darius, with only a small army of Persians and Medes and some trustworthy generals, overcame all these difficulties. By 520 BC/519 BC all the rebellions were put down. Even 
2 CONC Babylon—which had rebelled twice—and Susiana, which had risen three times, both submitted, and the authority of Darius was established throughout the empire.

2 CONT <p>The empire under Darius</p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Governance</p>
2 CONT <p>Darius in his inscriptions appears as a fervent believer in the monotheistic religion of Zoroaster. He was also a great statesman and organizer. Darius thoroughly revised the Persian system of admi
2 CONC nistration and also the legal code. His revisions of the legal code revolved around laws of evidence, slave sales, deposits, bribery, and assault. The time of conquests had come to an end; the wars wh
2 CONC ich Darius undertook, like those of Augustus, only served the purpose of gaining strong natural frontiers for the empire and keeping down the barbarous tribes on its borders. Thus Darius subjugated th
2 CONC e wild nations of the Pontic and Armenian mountains, and extended the Persian dominion to the Caucasus; for the same reasons he fought against the Saka and other Iranian steppe tribes, as well as the 
2 CONC mysterious Turanians from beyond the Oxus. In the process of these campaigns he made military reforms such as introducing conscription, pay for soldiers, military training and he also made changes in 
2 CONC the army and navy. But by the organization which he gave to the empire he became the true successor of the great Cyrus. His organization of the provinces and the fixing of the tributes is described by
2 CONC  Herodotus (iii. 90 if.), evidently from good official sources. He divided the Persian Empire into twenty provinces, each under the supervision of a governor or satrap. The satrap position was usually
2 CONC  hereditary and largely autonomous, allowing each province its own distinct laws, traditions, and elite class. Every region, however, was responsible for paying a gold or silver tribute to the emperor
2 CONC ; many areas, such as Babylonia, underwent severe economic decline resulting from these quotas. Each satrapy also had an independent financial controller, an independent military coordinator as well a
2 CONC s the satrap, who controlled administration and the law. All three probably reported directly to the king. This more evenly distributed power within the satrapy and lowered the chance of revolt. Dariu
2 CONC s also increased the bureaucracy of the empire, with many scribes employed to provide records of the administration.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Building Projects</p>
2 CONT <p>Many building projects were initiated during the reign of Darius, with the largest being the building of the new capital of Persepolis. Pasargadae was too well associated with the previous dynasty 
2 CONC of Cyrus and Cambyses and so Darius sought a new capital. The city would have walls sixty feet high and thirty-three feet thick and would be an enormous engineering undertaking. Darius' tomb was cut i
2 CONC nto a rock face not far from the city. He dug a canal from the Nile to Suez, and, as the fragments of a hieroglyphic inscription found there show, his ships sailed from the Nile through the Red Sea by
2 CONC  Saba to Persia. Darius also commissioned the extensive road network that was built all over the country. The Persepolis Tablets mention a ‘royal road’ from Susa to Persepolis and from Sardis to S
2 CONC usa built by Darius. It was highly organised with rest stations, guarded garrisons, inns and apparently no bandits. Darius is also remembered for his Behistun Inscription which was chiselled into the 
2 CONC rock face near the town of Behistun. It showed Darius' successful ascension to the throne and described Darius legitimacy to be king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Economy, diplomacy and trade</p>
2 CONT <p>Darius is often renowned above all as being a great financier. He fixed the coinage and introduced the gold coinage of the Daric. He tried to develop the commerce of the empire, and sent an expedit
2 CONC ion down the Kabul and the Indus, led by the Carian captain Scylax of Caryanda, who explored the Indian Ocean from the mouth of the Indus to Suez. During his reign, the population increased and indust
2 CONC ries flourished in towns.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Persia under Darius probably had connections with Carthage (cf. the Karka of the Nakshi Rustam inscription), and his emissaries explored the shores of Sicily and Italy. At the same time he attempte
2 CONC d to gain the good-will of the subject nations, and for this purpose promoted the aims of their priests. He allowed the Jews to build the Temple of Jerusalem. In Egypt his name appears on the temples 
2 CONC which he built in Memphis, Edfu and the Great Oasis. He called the high-priest of Sais, Tzahor, to Susa (as we learn from his inscription in the Vatican Museum), and gave him full powers to reorganize
2 CONC  the "house of life," the great medical school of the temple of Sais.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Egyptian traditions he is considered as one of the great benefactors and lawgivers of the country. In similar relations he stood to the Greek sanctuaries (cf. his rescript to "his slave" God
2 CONC atas, the inspector of a royal park near Magnesia on the Maeander, in which he grants freedom of taxes and forced labor to the sacred territory of Apollo); all the Greek oracles in Asia Minor and Euro
2 CONC pe therefore stood on the side of Persia in the Persian Wars and admonished the Greeks to attempt resistance.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Weights and measures were standardised (as in a "royal cubit" or a "king’s measure") but often they still operated side by side with their Egyptian or Babylonian counterparts. This would have bee
2 CONC n a boon for merchants and traders as trade would now have been far simpler. The upgraded communication and administration networks also helped to turn the Empire ruled by the Achaemenid dynasty into 
2 CONC a seemingly commercial entity based on generating wealth.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Darius also continued the process of religious tolerance to his subjects, which had been important parts of the reigns' of Cyrus and Cambyses. Darius himself was completely monotheistic - in royal 
2 CONC inscriptions Ahuramazda is the only god mentioned by name. But, time and again he is mentioned worshipping, funding or giving ‘lip-service’ to various pantheons of gods. This was important as the 
2 CONC majority of the empire's inhabitants were polytheists. Also like many other Persian Kings he continued his no slave policy, for example all workers at the Persepolis sight and other sights made for hi
2 CONC m were paid, this was revolutionary at the time. His human rights policies were also common to his ancestory and future Persian kings too, continuing the legacy of the first human rights document ever
2 CONC  made.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>European and North African campaigns</p>
2 CONT <p>About 512 BC Darius undertook a war against the Scythians. A great army crossed the Bosporus, subjugated eastern Thrace, and crossed the Danube. The purpose of this war can only have been to attack
2 CONC  the nomadic tribes in the rear and thus to secure peace on the northern frontier of the empire. Yet the whole plan was based upon an incorrect geographical assumption; a common one in that era, and r
2 CONC epeated by Alexander the Great and his Macedonians, who believed that on the Hindu Kush (which they called the Caucasus Indicus) and on the shores of the Jaxartes (which they called Tanais, i.e., the 
2 CONC River Don) they were quite near to the Black Sea. Of course the expedition undertaken on these grounds could only prove a failure; having advanced for some weeks into the Russian steppes, Darius was f
2 CONC orced to return. The details given by Herodotus (according to him, Darius had reached the Volga) are quite fantastic; and the account which Darius himself had given on a tablet, which was added to his
2 CONC  great inscription in Behistun, is destroyed with the exception of a few words.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although European Greece was intimately connected with the coasts of Asia Minor, and the opposing parties in the Greek towns were continually soliciting his intervention, Darius did not meddle with
2 CONC  their affairs. The Persian wars were begun by the Greeks themselves. The support which Athens and Eretria gave to the rebellious Ionians and Carians made their punishment inevitable as soon as the re
2 CONC bellion had been put down. But the first expedition, that of Mardonius, failed on the cliffs of Mount Athos (492 BC), and the army which was led into Attica by Datis in 490 BC was beaten at the Battle
2 CONC  of Marathon. Before Darius had finished his preparations for a third expedition an insurrection broke out in Egypt (486 BC). In the next year Darius died, probably in October 485 BC, after a reign of
2 CONC  thirty-six years.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Alexander I (Greek: ????a?d??? ? ?a?ed??) was ruler of Macedon from 498 BC to 454 BC. He was the son of Amyntas I of Macedon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Herodotus he was unfriendly to Persia, and had the envoys of Darius I killed when they arrived at the court of his father during the Ionian Revolt. However, he was forced to submit to 
2 CONC Persia during the invasion of Greece by Darius' son Xerxes I, and he acted as a representative of the Persian governor Mardonius during peace negotiations after the Persian defeat at the Battle of Sal
2 CONC amis in 480 BC. Despite his cooperation with Persia, he frequently gave supplies and advice to the Greeks, and warned them of Mardonius' plans before the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. Alexander eventua
2 CONC lly regained Macedonia's independence after the end of the Persian Wars.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although Macedon was considered a semi-barbaric state by some Greeks (especially those whose colonies near Macedonia were threatened by Macedonian expansion), Alexander claimed descent from Argive 
2 CONC Greeks and Hercules. After a court of hellanodikai determined his claim to be true, he was permitted to participate in the Olympic Games, an honor reserved only for Greeks. He modeled his court after 
2 CONC Athens and was a patron of the poet Pindar.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Vishtaspa (fl. 550 BC), known under his Hellenized name Hystaspes (Ὑστάσπης), was a Persian satrap of Bactria and Persis. He was the father of Darius I, king of the Achaemenid Empire, and 
2 CONC Artabanus, who was a trusted advisor to both his brother Darius as well as Darius's son and successor, Xerxes I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The son of Arsames, Hystaspes was a member of the Persian royal house of the Achaemenids. He was satrap of Persis under Cambyses, and probably under Cyrus the Great also. He accompanied Cyrus on hi
2 CONC s expedition against the Massagetae. But he was sent back to Persis, to keep watch over his eldest son Darius, whom Cyrus, in consequence of a dream, suspected of considering treason.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Besides Darius, Hystaspes had two sons, Artabanus and Artanes. Ammianus Marcellinus makes him a chief of the Magians, and tells a story of his studying in India under the Brahmins. His name occurs

2 CONC ty. When Cyrus became (in about 558 bc) ruler of the Persian district of Anshan, the district was subject to the Medes; five years later he led a rebellion against the Medes that resulted in the captu
2 CONC re of King Astyages (reigned about 584 to about 550 bc) and the overthrow (550 bc) of the Median Empire. Thereafter Cyrus called himself king of Persia and ruled a territory extending from the Halys R
2 CONC iver in Asia Minor, eastern border of Lydia, to the Babylonian Empire on the south and east. Babylon, Egypt, Lydia, and the city-state of Sparta in Greece combined to curb the power of Cyrus, but in a

2 CONT <p>The Persian Empire was the most powerful state in the world until its conquest two centuries later by Alexander the Great. Cyrus was an able and merciful ruler. Significant among his deeds was his

2 CONT <p>Cyrus the Great (Old Persian:, IPA: [kʰuːruʃ], Kūruš[4], Persian: کوروش بزرگ, Kūrosh-e-Bozorg) (c. 600 BC or 576 BC – December] 530 BC), also known as Cyrus II or Cyrus of Persia, 
2 CONC was the first Zoroastrian Persian emperor. He was the founder of the Persian Empire under the Achaemenid dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a military leader, Cyrus left a legacy on the art of leadership and decision making, and he attributed his success to "Diversity in counsel, unity in command."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It was under his own rule that the empire embraced all previous civilized states of the ancient Near East, expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of Southwest Asia and much of Central Asia, 
2 CONC from Egypt and the Hellespont in the west to the Indus River in the east, to create the largest empire the world had yet seen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The reign of Cyrus lasted 29 to 31 years. Cyrus built his empire by fighting and conquering first the Median Empire, then the Lydian Empire and the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Either before or after Bab
2 CONC ylon, he led an expedition into central Asia, which resulted in major campaigns that brought "into subjection every nation without exception." Cyrus did not venture into Egypt, as he himself died in b
2 CONC attle, fighting the Massagetae along the Syr Darya in December 530 BC. He was succeeded by his son, Cambyses II, who managed to add to the empire by conquering Egypt, Nubia, and Cyrenaica during his s
2 CONC hort rule.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a military leader, Cyrus left a legacy on the art of leadership and decision making, and he attributed his success to "Diversity in counsel, unity in command." Cyrus the Great respected the cust
2 CONC oms and religions of the lands he conquered. It is said that in universal history, the role of the Achaemenid empire founded by Cyrus lies in its very successful model for centralized administration a
2 CONC nd establishing a government working to the advantage and profit of its subjects. In fact, the administration of the empire through satraps and the vital principle of forming a government at Pasargada
2 CONC e were the work of Cyrus.[15] Aside from his own nation, Iran, Cyrus also left a lasting legacy on Jewish religion (through his Edict of Restoration), human rights, politics, and military strategy, as
2 CONC  well as on both Eastern and Western civilizations.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The word Cyrus is derived, via Latin, from Ancient Greek, from Old Persian likely originally from Elamite Kurash meaning to bestow care.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The name has been recorded in ancient inscriptions in many different languages. The ancient Greek historians Ctesias and Plutarch noted that Cyrus was named from Kuros, the Sun, a concept which has
2 CONC  been interpreted as meaning "like the Sun" by noting its relation to the Persian noun for sun, khor, while using -vash as a suffix of likeness. However, Karl Hoffmann and Rüdiger Schmitt of the Ency
2 CONC clopædia Iranica have suggested the translation "humiliator of the enemy in verbal contest."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Iran, Cyrus is always referred to as "Kūrošé Bozorg" and/or "Kūrošé Kabīr"  — meaning "Cyrus the Great". In the Bible, he is known as simply Koresh (Hebrew: כורש‎).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The four winged guardian figure, a bas-relief found at Pasargadae on top of which was once inscribed in three languages the sentence "I am Cyrus the king an Achaemenian."[20]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Persian domination and kingdom in the Iranian plateau started by an extension of the Achaemenid dynasty, who expanded their earlier domination possibly from the 9th century BC onward. The epony
2 CONC mous founder of this dynasty was Achaemenes (from Old Persian Haxāmaniš). Achaemenids are "descendants of Achaemenes" as Darius the Great, the ninth king of the dynasty, traces his genealogy to him 
2 CONC and declares "for this reason we are called Achaemenids". Achaemenes built the state Parsumash in the southwest of Iran and was succeeded by Teispes, who took the title "King of Anshan" after seizing 
2 CONC Anshan city and enlarging his kingdom further to include Pars proper.[8] Ancient documents[21] mention that Teispes had a son called Cyrus I, who also succeeded his father as "king of Anshan". Cyrus I
2 CONC  had a full brother whose name is recorded as Ariaramnes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 600 BC, Cyrus I was succeeded by his son Cambyses I who reigned until 559 BC. Cyrus the Great was a son of Cambyses I, who named his son after his father, Cyrus I. There are several inscriptions
2 CONC  of Cyrus the Great and later kings that refer to Cambyses I as "great king" and "king of Anshan". Among these are some passages in the Cyrus cylinder where Cyrus calls himself "son of Cambyses, great
2 CONC  king, king of Anshan". Another inscription (from CM's) mentions Cambyses I as "mighty king" and "an Achaemenian", which according to bulk of scholarly opinion was engraved under Darius and considered
2 CONC  as a later forgery by Darius.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However "Cambyses II"'s maternal grandfather Pharnaspes is named by Herodotus as "an Achaemenian" too. Xenophon's account in Cyropædia further names Cambyses's wife as Mandane and mentions Cambyse
2 CONC s as king of Persia. These agree with Cyrus's own inscriptions, as Anshan and Parsa were different names of the same land. These also agree with other non-Iranian accounts, except at one point from He
2 CONC rodotus that Cambyses was not a king but a "Persian of good family".[26] However, in some other passages, his account is wrong also on the name of the son of Chishpish, which he mentions as Cambyses b
2 CONC ut, according to modern scholars, should be Cyrus I.[27]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The traditional view which based on archaeological research and the genealogy given in the Behistun Inscription and Herodotus[8] held that Cyrus was an Achaemenian. However it has been suggested by
2 CONC  M. Waters and that Cyrus is unrelated to Achaemenes or Darius the Great and that his family was of Teispid and Anshanite origin instead of Achaemenid,[28] though this view is not universally accepted
2 CONC .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Early life</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The best-known date for the birth of Cyrus is either 600-599 BC or 576-575 BC.[29] Little is known of his early years, as there are only a few sources known to detail that part of his life, and the
2 CONC y have been damaged or lost.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Herodotus' story of Cyrus's early life belongs to a genre of legends in which abandoned children of noble birth, such as Oedipus and Romulus and Remus, return to claim their royal positions. Simila
2 CONC r to other culture heroes and founders of great empires, folk traditions abound regarding his family background. According to Herodotus, he was the grandson of the Median king Astyages and was brought
2 CONC  up by humble herding folk. In another version, he was presented as the son of poor parents who worked in the Median court. These folk stories are, however, contradicted by his own testimony, accordin
2 CONC g to which he was preceded as king of Persia by his father, grandfather and great-grandfather[30].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the birth of Cyrus, Astyages had a dream that his Magi interpreted as a sign that his grandson would eventually overthrow him. He then ordered his steward Harpagus to kill the infant. Harpagu
2 CONC s, morally unable to kill a newborn, summoned the Mardian Mitradates (which the historian Nicolaus of Damascus calls Atradates), a royal bandit herdsman from the mountainous region bordering the Saspi
2 CONC res,[31] and ordered him to leave the baby to die in the mountains. Luckily, the herdsman and his wife (whom Herodotus calls Cyno in Greek, and Spaca-o in Median) took pity and raised the child as the
2 CONC ir own, passing off their recently stillbirth infant as the murdered Cyrus.[32][33] For the origin of Cyrus's mother, Herodotus says Mandane of Media and Ctesias insist that she is full Persian but gi
2 CONC ve no name, while Nicolaus gives the name Argoste as Atradates' wife, whether this figure represents Cyno or Cambyses' unnamed Persian queen has yet to be determined. It is also known that Strabo says
2 CONC  that Cyrus was originally named Agradates by his stepparents; therefore, it is probable that, when reuniting with his original family, in custom Cambyses names him (or had named him before the separa
2 CONC tion) Cyrus after his own father, who was Cyrus I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Herodotus claims that when Cyrus was ten years old, it was obvious that Cyrus was not a herdsman's son, stating that his behavior was too noble. Astyages interviewed the boy and noticed that they r
2 CONC esembled each other. Astyages ordered Harpagus to explain what he had done with the baby, and, after confessing that he had not killed the boy, the king tricked him into eating his own broiled and cho
2 CONC pped up son.[34] Astyages was more lenient with Cyrus and allowed him to return to his biological parents, Cambyses and Mandane.[35] While Herodotus's description may be a legend, it does give insight
2 CONC  into the figures surrounding Cyrus the Great's early life.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus had a wife named Cassandane. She was an Achaemenian and daughter of Pharnaspes. From this marriage, Cyrus had four children: Cambyses II, Bardiya, Atossa, and another daughter whose name is n
2 CONC ot attested in ancient sources. Also, Cyrus had a fifth child named Artystone, the sister or half-sister of Atossa, who may not have been the daughter of Cassandane. Cyrus had a special dearly love fo
2 CONC r Cassandane, and, according to the chronicle of Nabonidus, when she died, all the nations of Cyrus's empire observed "a great mourning", and, particularly in Babylonia, there was probably even a publ
2 CONC ic mourning lasting for six days (identified from 21–26 March 538 BC). Her tomb is suggested to be at Cyrus's capital, Pasargadae.[36] There are other accounts suggesting that Cyrus the Great also m
2 CONC arried a daughter of the Median king Astyages, named Amytis. This name may not be the correct one, however. Cyrus probably had once and after the death of Cassandane a Median woman in his royal family
2 CONC .[37] Cyrus' sons Cambyses II and Smerdis both later became kings of Persia, respectively, and his daughter Atossa married Darius the Great and bore him Xerxes I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Though his father died in 551 BC, Cyrus had already succeeded to the throne in 559 BC. However, Cyrus was not yet an independent ruler. Like his predecessors, Cyrus had to recognize Median overlord
2 CONC ship. During Astyages's reign, the Median Empire may have ruled over the majority of the Ancient Near East, from the Lydian frontier in the west to the Parthians and Persians in the east.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Herodotus's version, Harpagus, seeking vengeance, convinced Cyrus to rally the Persian people to revolt against their feudal lords, the Medes. However, it is likely that both Harpagus and Cyrus 
2 CONC rebelled due to their dissatisfaction with Astyages's policies.[32] From the start of the revolt in summer 553 BC, with his first battles taking place from early 552 BC, Harpagus, with Cyrus, led his 
2 CONC armies against the Medes until the capture of Ecbatana in 549 BC, effectively conquering the Median Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While Cyrus seems to have accepted the crown of Media, by 546 BC, he officially assumed the title "King of Persia" instead. With Astyages out of power, all of his vassals (including many of Cyrus's
2 CONC  relatives) were now under his command. His uncle Arsames, who had been the king of the city-state of Parsa under the Medes, therefore would have had to give up his throne. However, this transfer of p
2 CONC ower within the family seems to have been smooth, and it is likely that Arsames was still the nominal governor of Parsa, under Cyrus's authority—more of a Prince or a Grand Duke than a King.[citatio
2 CONC n needed] His son, Hystaspes, who was also Cyrus' second cousin, was then made satrap of Parthia and Phrygia. Cyrus thus united the twin Achamenid kingdoms of Parsa and Anshan into Persia proper. Arsa
2 CONC mes would live to see his grandson become Darius the Great, Shahanshah of Persia, after the deaths of both of Cyrus' sons.[39]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus's conquest of Media was merely the start of his wars. Astyages had been allied with his brother-in-law Croesus of Lydia (son of Alyattes II), Nabonidus of Babylon, and Amasis II of Egypt, who
2 CONC  reportedly intended to join forces against Cyrus.

2 CONT <p>The exact dates of the Lydian conquest are unknown, but it must have taken place between Cyrus's overthrow of the Mede kingdom (550 BC) and his conquest of Babylon (539 BC). It was common in the pa
2 CONC st to give 547 BC as the year of the conquest due to some interpretations of the Nabonidus Chronicle, but this position is currently not much held.[40] The Lydians first attacked the Achaemenid Empire
2 CONC 's city of Pteria in Cappadocia. Croesus besieged and captured the city enslaving its inhabitants. Meanwhile, the Persians invited the citizens of Ionia who were part of the Lydian kingdom to revolt a
2 CONC gainst their ruler. The offer was rebuffed, and thus Cyrus levied an army and marched against the Lydians, increasing his numbers while passing through nations in his way. The Battle of Pteria was eff
2 CONC ectively a stalemate, with both sides suffering heavy casualties by nightfall. Croesus retreated to Sardis the following morning.[41]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While in Sardis, Croesus sent out requests for his allies to send aid to Lydia. However, near the end of winter, before the allies could unite, Cyrus pushed the war into Lydian territory and besieg
2 CONC ed Croesus in his capital, Sardis. Shortly before the final Battle of Thymbra between the two rulers, Harpagus advised Cyrus to place his dromedaries in front of his warriors; the Lydian horses, not u
2 CONC sed to the dromedaries' smell, would be very afraid. The strategy worked; the Lydian cavalry was routed. Cyrus defeated and captured Croesus. Cyrus occupied the capital at Sardis, conquering the Lydia
2 CONC n kingdom in 546 BC.[41] According to Herodotus, Cyrus spared Croesus' life and kept him as an advisor, but this account conflicts with some translations of the contemporary Nabonidus Chronicle, which
2 CONC  interpret that the king of Lydia was slain.[42]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before returning to the capital, a Lydian named Pactyes was entrusted by Cyrus to send Croesus' treasury to Persia. However, soon after Cyrus's departure, Pactyes hired mercenaries and caused an up
2 CONC rising in Sardis, revolting against the Persian satrap of Lydia, Tabalus. With recommendations from Croesus that he should turn the minds of the Lydian people to luxury, Cyrus sent Mazares, one of his
2 CONC  commanders, to subdue the insurrection but demanded that Pactyas be returned alive. Upon Mazares's arrival, Pactyas fled to Ionia, where he had hired more mercenaries. Mazares marched his troops into
2 CONC  the Greek country and subdued the cities of Magnesia and Priene, where Pactyas was captured and sent back to Persia for punishment.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mazares continued the conquest of Asia Minor but died of unknown causes during his campaign in Ionia. Cyrus sent Harpagus to complete Mazares's conquest of Asia Minor. Harpagus captured Lycia, Cili
2 CONC cia and Phoenicia, using the technique of building earthworks to breach the walls of besieged cities, a method unknown to the Greeks. He ended his conquest of the area in 542 BC and returned to Persia
2 CONC .[32]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Superimposed on modern borders, the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus's rule extended approximately from Turkey, Israel, Georgia and Arabia in the west to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Indus River and Om
2 CONC an in the east. Persia became the largest empire the world had ever seen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By the year 540 BC, Cyrus captured Elam (Susiana) and its capital, Susa.[43] The Nabonidus Chronicle records that, prior to the battle(s), Nabonidus had ordered cult statues from outlying Babylonia
2 CONC n cities to be brought into the capital, suggesting that the conflict had begun possibly in the winter of 540 BC.[44] Near the beginning of October, Cyrus fought the Battle of Opis in or near the stra
2 CONC tegic riverside city of Opis on the Tigris, north of Babylon. The Babylonian army was routed, and on October 10, Sippar was seized without a battle, with little to no resistance from the populace.[45]
2 CONC  It is probable that Cyrus engaged in negotiations with the Babylonian generals to obtain a compromise on their part and therefore avoid an armed confrontation.[46] Nabonidus was staying in the city a
2 CONC t the time and soon fled to the capital, Babylon, which he had not visited in years.[47]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Two days later, on October 7 (proleptic Gregorian calendar), Gubaru's troops entered Babylon, again without any resistance from the Babylonian armies, and detained Nabonidus.[48] Herodotus explains
2 CONC  that to accomplish this feat, the Persians diverted the Euphrates river into a canal so that the water level dropped "to the height of the middle of a man's thigh", which allowed the invading forces 
2 CONC to march directly through the river bed to enter at night.[49] On October 29, Cyrus himself entered the city of Babylon and detained Nabonidus.[50]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prior to Cyrus's invasion of Babylon, the Neo-Babylonian Empire had conquered many kingdoms. In addition to Babylonia itself, Cyrus probably incorporated its subnational entities into his Empire, i
2 CONC ncluding Syria, Judea, and Arabia Petraea, although there is no direct evidence of this fact.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After taking Babylon, Cyrus proclaimed himself "king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four corners of the world" in the famous Cyrus cylinder, an inscription deposited in the founda
2 CONC tions of the Esagila temple dedicated to the chief Babylonian god, Marduk. The text of the cylinder denounces Nabonidus as impious and portrays the victorious Cyrus as pleasing to Marduk. It goes on t
2 CONC o describe how Cyrus had improved the lives of the citizens of Babylonia, repatriated displaced peoples and restored temples and cult sanctuaries. Although some have asserted that the cylinder represe
2 CONC nts a form of human rights charter, historians generally portray it in the context of a long-standing Mesopotamian tradition of new rulers beginning their reigns with declarations of reforms.[52]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus's dominions comprised the largest empire the world had ever seen.[9] At the end of Cyrus's rule, the Achaemenid Empire stretched from Asia Minor in the west to the northwestern areas of India
2 CONC  in the east.[53]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The details of Cyrus's death can vary by account. The account of Herodotus from his Histories provides the second-longest detail, in which Cyrus met his fate in a fierce battle with the Massagetae,
2 CONC  a tribe from the southern deserts of Khwarezm and Kyzyl Kum in the southernmost portion of the steppe regions of modern-day Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, following the advice of Croesus to attack them i
2 CONC n their own territory.[54] The Massagetae were related to the Scythians in their dress and mode of living; they fought on horseback and on foot. In order to acquire her realm, Cyrus first sent an offe
2 CONC r of marriage to their ruler, Tomyris, a proposal she rejected. He then commenced his attempt to take Massagetae territory by force, beginning by building bridges and towered war boats along his side 
2 CONC of the river Jaxartes, or Syr Darya, which separated them. Sending him a warning to cease his encroachment in which she stated she expected he would disregard anyway, Tomyris challenged him to meet he
2 CONC r forces in honorable warfare, inviting him to a location in her country a day's march from the river, where their two armies would formally engage each other. He accepted her offer, but, learning tha
2 CONC t the Massagetae were unfamiliar with wine and its intoxicating effects, he set up and then left camp with plenty of it behind, taking his best soldiers with him and leaving the least capable ones. Th
2 CONC e general of Tomyris's army, who was also her son Spargapises, and a third of the Massagetian troops killed the group Cyrus had left there and, finding the camp well stocked with food and the wine, un
2 CONC wittingly drank themselves into inebriation, diminishing their capability to defend themselves, when they were then overtaken by a surprise attack. They were successfully defeated, and, although he wa
2 CONC s taken prisoner, Spargapises committed suicide once he regained sobriety. Upon learning of what had transpired, Tomyris denounced Cyrus's tactics as underhanded and swore vengeance, leading a second 
2 CONC wave of troops into battle herself. Cyrus was ultimately killed, and his forces suffered massive casualties in what Herodotus referred to as the fiercest battle of his career and the ancient world. Wh
2 CONC en it was over, Tomyris ordered the body of Cyrus brought to her, then decapitated him and dipped his head in a vessel of blood in a symbolic gesture of revenge for his bloodlust and the death of her 
2 CONC son.[55][56] However, some scholars question this version, mostly because Herodotus admits this event was one of many versions of Cyrus's death that he heard from a supposedly reliable source who told
2 CONC  him no one was there to see the aftermath. Nevertheless, others suggest the Persian troops may have later recovered the body after it was crucified, which was also after his beheading, or that Tomyri
2 CONC s beheaded and then crucified a man other than Cyrus, or Cyrus's double.[citation needed]Ctesias, in his Persica, has the longest account, which says Cyrus met his death while putting down resistance 
2 CONC from the Derbices infantry, aided by other Scythian archers and cavalry, plus Indians and their elephants. According to him, this event took place northeast of the headwaters of the Syr Darya.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>An alternative account from Xenophon's Cyropaedia contradicts the others, claiming that Cyrus died peaceably at his capital.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The final version of Cyrus's death comes from Berossus, who only reports Cyrus met his death while warring against the Dahae archers northwest of the headwaters of the Syr Darya.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus' remains were interred in his capital city of Pasargadae, where today a tomb still exists which many believe to be his. Both Strabo and Arrian give nearly equal descriptions of the tomb, base
2 CONC d on the eyewitness report of Aristobulus of Cassandreia, who at the instigation of Alexander the Great visited the tomb two times.[58] Though the city itself is now in ruins, the burial place of Cyru
2 CONC s the Great has remained largely intact; and the tomb has been partially restored to counter its natural deterioration over the years. According to Plutarch, his epitaph said,
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>“O man, whoever you are and wherever you come from, for I know you will come, I am Cyrus who won the Persians their empire. Do not therefore begrudge me this bit of earth that covers my bones.”
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cuneiform evidence from Babylon proves that Cyrus died around December 530 BC,[12] and that his son Cambyses II had become king. Cambyses continued his father's policy of expansion, and managed to 
2 CONC capture Egypt for the Empire, but soon died after only seven years of rule. He was succeeded either by Cyrus' other son Bardiya or an impostor posing as Bardiya, who became the sole ruler of Persia fo
2 CONC r seven months, until he was killed by Darius the Great.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus was praised in the Tanakh (Isaiah 45:1-6) and (Ezra 1:1-11) for the freeing of slaves, humanitarian equality and costly reparations he makes. However he has been criticized for believing the 
2 CONC false report of the Cuthites, who wanted to halt the rebuilding of the Temple. They accused the Jews of conspiring to rebel, so "the king of Persia" in turn stopped the construction of the Temple, whi
2 CONC ch would not be completed until 516BC,[citation needed] during the reign of Darius the Great. According to the Bible, it was King Artaxerxes who was convinced to stop the construction of the second te
2 CONC mple in Jerusalem.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus the Great liberated the Hebrew exiles to resettle and rebuild Jerusalem, earning him an honored place in Judaism.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In scope and extent his achievements ranked far above that of the Macedonian king,

2 CONT <p>Alexander who was to demolish the empire in the 320's but fail to provide any stable alternative.

2 CONT <p>—Charles Freeman in 'The Greek Achievement'[61]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The achievements of Cyrus the Great throughout antiquity is well reflected in the way he is remembered today. His own nation, the Iranians, regarded him as "The Father" and the Babylonians as "The 
2 CONC Liberator".[62] After this liberation of Babylonians, followed Cyrus' liberal help for the return of Jews. For this, Cyrus is addressed in the Jewish Tanakh as the "Lord's Messiah". Glorified by Ezra,
2 CONC  and by Isaiah, Cyrus is the one to whom "Yahweh, the god of heaven" has given "all the Kingdoms of the earth".
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus was distinguished equally as a statesman and as a soldier. By pursuing a policy of generosity instead of repression, and by favoring local religions, he was able to make his newly conquered s
2 CONC ubjects into enthusiastic supporters.[63] Due in part to the political infrastructure he created, the Achaemenid empire endured long after his death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The rise of Persia under Cyrus's rule had a profound impact on the course of world history. Iranian philosophy, literature and religion all played dominant roles in world events for the next millen
2 CONC nia. Despite the Islamic conquest of Persia in the 7th century CE by the Islamic Caliphate, Persia continued to exercise enormous influence in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, and was pa
2 CONC rticularly instrumental in the growth and expansion of Islam.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Many of the Iranian dynasties following the Achaemenid empire and their kings saw themselves as the heirs to Cyrus the Great and have claimed to continue the line begun by Cyrus.[citation needed] H
2 CONC owever there are different opinions among scholars whether this is also the case for the Sassanid Dynasty.[64] Mohammad Reza Shah of Pahlavi dynasty celebrated the 2500th anniversary of the Iranian mo
2 CONC narchy in 1971, though it ended with the 1979 revolution. Even today many consider Cyrus greater than Alexander the Great in his accomplishment.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Professor Richard Nelson Frye:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>“It is a testimony to the capability of the founder of the Achaemenian empire that it continued to expand after his death and lasted for more than two centuries. But Cyrus was not only a great co
2 CONC nqueror and administrator; he held a place in the minds of the Persian people similar to that of Romulus and Remus in Rome or Moses for the Israelites. His saga follows in many details the stories of 
2 CONC hero and conquerors from elsewhere in the ancient world. The manner in which the baby Cyrus was given to a shepherd to raise is reminiscent of Moses in the bulrushes in Egypt, and the overthrow of his
2 CONC  tyrannical grandfather has echoes in other myths and legends. There is no doubt that the Cyrus saga arose early among the Persians and was known to the Greeks. The sentiments of esteem or even awe in
2 CONC  which Persians held him were transmitted to the Greeks, and it was no accident that Xenophon chose Cyrus to be the model of a ruler for the lessons he wished to impart to his fellow Greeks.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In short, the figure of Cyrus has survived throughout history as more than a great man who founded an empire. He became the epitome of the great qualities expected of a ruler in antiquity, and he a
2 CONC ssumed heroic features as a conqueror who was tolerant and magnanimous as well as brave and daring. His personality as seen by the Greeks influenced them and Alexander the Great, and, as the tradition
2 CONC  was transmitted by the Romans, may be considered to influence our thinking even now. In the year 1971, Iran celebrated the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the monarchy by Cyrus."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On another account, Prof. Patrick Hunt states:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>“If you are looking at the greatest personages in History who have affected the World, 'Cyrus the Great' is one of the few who deserves that epithet, the one who deserves to be called 'the Great'
2 CONC . The empire over which Cyrus ruled was the largest the Ancient World had ever seen and may be to this day the largest empire ever.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Religious policy of Cyrus is well documented in Babylonian texts as well as Jewish sources. Cyrus initiated a general policy that can be described as a policy of permitting religious freedom throug
2 CONC hout his vast empire. He brought peace to the Babylonians and is said to have kept his army away from the temples and restored the statues of the Babylonian gods to their sanctuaries.[14] Another exam
2 CONC ple of his religious policies, as evidenced by the Cyrus cylinder (see below), was his treatment of the Jews during their exile in Babylon after Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed Jerusalem. The Jewish Bible
2 CONC 's Ketuvim ends in Second Chronicles with the decree of Cyrus, which returned the exiles to the Promised Land from Babylon along with a commission to rebuild the temple.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'Thus saith Cyrus, king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth hath Yahweh, the god of heaven, given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever the
2 CONC re is among you of all His people -- may Yahweh, his god, be with him -- let him go there.' (2 Chronicles 36:23)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This edict is also fully reproduced in the Book of Ezra.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree: ‘Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the temple, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt and let its foundat
2 CONC ions be retained, its height being 60 cubits and its width 60 cubits; with three layers of huge stones and one layer of timbers. And let the cost be paid from the royal treasury. ‘Also let the gold 
2 CONC and silver utensils of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shal
2 CONC l put them in the house of God.’ (Ezra 6:3-5)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a result of Cyrus' policies, the Jews honored him as a dignified and righteous king. He is the only Gentile to be designated as Messiah, a divinely appointed leader, in the Tanakh (Isaiah 45:1-6
2 CONC ). Isaiah 45:13: "I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness: I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, but not for a price or reward, says Yahweh Almighty." As
2 CONC  the text suggests, Cyrus did ultimately release the nation of Israel from its exile without compensation or tribute. Traditionally, the entire book of Isaiah is believed to pre-date the rule of Cyrus
2 CONC  by about 120 years. These particular passages (Isaiah 40-55, often referred to as Deutero-Isaiah) are believed by most modern critical scholars to have been added by another author toward the end of 
2 CONC the Babylonian exile(ca. 536 BC).[67] Whereas Isaiah 1-39 (referred to as Proto-Isaiah) saw the destruction of Israel as imminent, and the restoration in the future, Deutero-Isaiah speaks of the destr
2 CONC uction in the past (Isa 42:24-25), and the restoration as imminent (Isa 42:1-9). Notice, for example, the change in temporal perspective from (Isa 39:6-7), where the Babylonian Captivity is cast far i
2 CONC n the future, to (Isa 43:14), where the Israelites are spoken of as already in Babylon.[68].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There was Jewish criticism of him after he was lied to by the Cuthites, who wanted to halt the building of the Second Temple. They accused the Jews of conspiring to rebel, so Cyrus in turn stopped 
2 CONC the construction, which would not be completed until 515 BC, during the reign of Darius I.[69][70] According to the Bible it was King Artaxerxes who was convinced to stop the construction of the templ
2 CONC e in Jerusalem. (Ezra 4:7-24)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some contemporary Muslim scholars have suggested that the Qur'anic figure of Dhul-Qarnayn is Cyrus the Great. This theory was proposed by Sunni scholar Abul Kalam Azad and endorsed by Shi'a scholar
2 CONC s Allameh Tabatabaei, in his Tafsir al-Mizan and Makarem Shirazi.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Politics and philosophy</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During his reign, Cyrus maintained control over a vast region of conquered kingdoms, achieved partly through retaining and expanding Median satrapies. Further organization of newly conquered territ
2 CONC ories into provinces ruled by vassal kings called satraps, was continued by Cyrus's successor Darius the Great. Cyrus's empire was based on tribute and conscripts from the many parts of his realm.[cit
2 CONC ation needed]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus's conquests began a new era in the age of empire building, where a vast superstate, comprising many dozens of countries, races, religions, and languages, were ruled under a single administrat
2 CONC ion headed by a central government. This system lasted for centuries, and was retained both by the invading Seleucid dynasty during their control of Persia, and later Iranian dynasties including the P
2 CONC ersian Parthians and Sassanids.[71]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On December 10, 2003, in her acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize, Shirin Ebadi evoked Cyrus, saying:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>“	I am an Iranian, a descendant of Cyrus the Great. This emperor proclaimed at the pinnacle of power 2,500 years ago that he 'would not reign over the people if they did not wish it.' He promised
2 CONC  not to force any person to change his religion and faith and guaranteed freedom for all. The Charter of Cyrus the Great should be studied in the history of human rights.[72]	”
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus's legacy has been felt even as far away as Iceland[73] and colonial America. Many of the forefathers of the United States of America sought inspiration from Cyrus the Great through works such
2 CONC  as Cyropaedia. Thomas Jefferson, for example, had two personal copies of the book, "which was a mandatory read for statesmen alongside Machiavelli's The Prince."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>One of the few surviving sources of information that can be dated directly to Cyrus's time is the Cyrus cylinder, a document in the form of a clay cylinder inscribed in Akkadian cuneiform. It had b
2 CONC een placed in the foundations of the Esagila (the temple of Marduk in Babylon) as a foundation deposit following the Persian conquest in 539 BC. It was discovered in 1879 and is kept today in the Brit
2 CONC ish Museum in London.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The text of the cylinder denounces the deposed Babylonian king Nabonidus as impious and portrays Cyrus as pleasing to the chief god Marduk. It goes on to describe how Cyrus had improved the lives o
2 CONC f the citizens of Babylonia, repatriated displaced peoples and restored temples and cult sanctuaries.[76] Although not mentioned in the text, the repatriation of the Jews from their "Babylonian captiv
2 CONC ity" was part of this policy.[77]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The British Museum describes the cylinder as "an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda" that "reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where, from as early as the third millennium BC, kings
2 CONC  began their reigns with declarations of reforms."[52] The cylinder emphasizes Cyrus's continuity with previous Babylonian rulers, asserting his virtue as a traditional Babylonian king while denigrati
2 CONC ng his predecessor.

2 CONC and is not mentioned by the cylinder.[82][83] The cylinder has, nonetheless, become seen as part of Iran's cultural identity.

2 CONT <p>Cyrus I (Old Persian Koroush), was King of Anshan from c. 600 to 580 BC or, according to others, from c. 652 to 600 BC. His name in Modern Persian is کوروش, while in Greek he was called Κύρ
2 CONC ος.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus was an early member of the Achaemenid dynasty. He was apparently a grandson of its founder Achaemenes and son of Teispes of Anshan. Teispes' sons reportedly divided the kingdom among them aft
2 CONC er his death. Cyrus reigned as King of Anshan while his brother was King Ariaramnes of Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The chronological placement of this event is uncertain. This is due to his suggested but still debated identification with the monarch known as "Kuras of Parsumas". Kuras is first mentioned c. 652 
2 CONC BC. At that year Shamash-shum-ukin, King of Babylon (668 - 648 BC) revolted against his older brother and overlord Ashurbanipal, King of Assyria (668 - 627 BC). Kuras is mentioned being in a military 
2 CONC alliance with the former. The war between the two brothers ended in 648 BC with the defeat and reported suicide of Shamash-shum-ukin.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Kuras is mentioned again in 639 BC. At that year Ashurbanibal managed to defeat Elam and became overlord to several of its former allies. Kuras was apparently among them. His elder son "Arukku" was
2 CONC  reportedly sent to Assyria to pay tribute to its King. Kuras then seems to vanish from historical record. His suggested identification with Cyrus would help connect the Achaemenid dynasty to the majo
2 CONC r events of the 7th century BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ashurbanipal died in 627 BC. Cyrus presumably continued paying tribute to his sons and successors Ashur-etil-ilani (627 - 623 BC) and Sin-shar-ishkun (623 BC - 612 BC). They were both opposed by an
2 CONC  alliance led by Cyaxares of the Medes (633 - 584 BC) and Nabopolassar of Babylon (626 - 605 BC). In 612 BC the two managed to capture the Assyrian capital Nineveh. This was effectively the end of the
2 CONC  Assyrian Empire though remnants of the Assyrian army under Ashur-uballit II (612 - 609 BC) continued to resist from Harran.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Media and Babylonia soon shared the lands previously controlled by the Assyrians. Anshan apparently fell under the control of the former. Cyrus is considered to have ended his days under the overlo
2 CONC rdship of either Cyaxares or his son Astyages (584 BC - 550 BC). Cyrus was succeeded by his son Cambyses I of Anshan. His grandson would come to be known as Cyrus the Great, creator of the Persian Emp
2 CONC ire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It has been noted that this account of his life and reign would place his early activities more than a century before those of his grandson. This would place his fathering of Cambyses very late in 
2 CONC life and his death at an advanced age. It has been argued that Kuras and Cyrus I were separate figures of uncertain relation to each other. The later would have then reigned in the early 6th century B
2 CONC C and his reign would seem rather uneventful. Due to the current lack of sufficient records for this historical period it remains uncertain which theory is closer to the facts.

2 CONT <p>Background</p>
2 CONT <p> Faravahar symbolizes Zoroastrianism, whose teachings influenced Cyrus to the extent that it became the de facto state religion of Persia.The name Cyrus is a Latin transliteration of the Greek ????
2 CONC ?, which is a version of the Old Persian Kourosh or Khorvash. The ancient historians Ctesias and Plutarch noted that Cyrus was named from Kuros, the sun, a concept which has been interpreted as meanin
2 CONC g "like the sun," by noting its relation to the Persian noun for sun, khorsheed, while using -vash as a suffix of likeness.[2] However, some modern historians, such as Karl Hoffmann and Rüdiger Schmi
2 CONC tt of the Encyclopædia Iranica, have suggested the translation "humiliator of the enemy in verbal contest."[3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In modern Persian, Cyrus is referred to as Kourosh-e Bozorg — the Persian-derived name for Cyrus the Great. In the Bible, he is known as simply Koresh.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Dynastic history</p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus the Great was the son of the Persian king Cambyses I and a Mede princess from the Achaemenid dynasty, which ruled the kingdom of Anshan, in what is now southwestern Iran. The dynasty had been
2 CONC  founded by Achaemenes (ca. 700 BC), who was succeeded by his son Teispes of Anshan. Inscriptions indicate that when the latter died, two of his sons shared the throne as Cyrus I of Anshan and Ariaram
2 CONC nes of Persia. They were succeeded by their respective sons Cambyses I of Anshan and Arsames of Persia.[2] However, the authenticity of these inscriptions has been called into question, thus blurring 
2 CONC the history of Cyrus' predecessors.[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p> A bas-relief found at Pasargadae shows a figure thought to be Cyrus, depicted with four Assyrian wings, and wearing a horned Egyptian-like crown and a Persian dress.Cambyses is considered by Herod
2 CONC otus and Ctesias to be of humble origin, but they further note his marriage to Princess Mandane of Media, who was the daughter of Princess Aryenis of Lydia and Astyages, king of the Medes. From their 
2 CONC union, Mandane bore only one son, Cyrus II, better known today as Cyrus the Great, whom Cambyses named after the child's grandfather.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Ctesias, Cyrus the Great married a daughter of Astyages, which seems unlikely, as his wife would also be his aunt. A possible explanation is that Astyages married again, and his second
2 CONC  wife bore him this daughter.[5] Cyrus' first wife, Cassandane, is equally obscure. According to Herodotus and the Behistun Inscription, she bore Cyrus at least two sons, Cambyses II and Smerdis.[1] B
2 CONC oth sons later separately ruled Persia for a short period of time. Cyrus also had several daughters, of which two would marry Darius the Great, Artystone[6] and Atossa. The latter is significant, as s
2 CONC he gave birth to of Xerxes I, Darius' successor.[7]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Early life</p>
2 CONT <p> The Homa griffin was one of the symbols of the Persian Empire.Cyrus was born in either 576 BC or 590 BC.[8] Little is known of his early years, as the sources detailing that part of his life are f
2 CONC ew, and have been damaged or lost.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Herodotus's story of Cyrus' early life belongs to a genre of legends in which abandoned children of noble birth, such as Oedipus or Romulus and Remus, return to claim their royal positions. His ove
2 CONC rlord was his own grandfather, Astyages, ruler of the powerful Median kingdom.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the birth of Cyrus, Astyages had a dream that his Magi interpreted as a sign that his grandson would eventually overthrow him. He then ordered his steward Harpagus to kill the infant. Harpagu
2 CONC s, morally unable to kill a newborn, summoned a herdsman of the king named Mithridates and ordered him to dispose of the child. Luckily for the young boy, the herdsman took him in and raised him as hi
2 CONC s own.[9][10]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Cyrus was ten years old, Herodotus claims that it was obvious that Cyrus was not a herdsman's son, stating that his behavior was too noble. Astyages interviewed the boy and noticed that they r
2 CONC esembled each other. Astyages ordered Harpagus to explain what he had done with the baby, and after confessing that he had not killed the boy, the king forced him to eat his own son.[11] Astyages was 
2 CONC more lenient with Cyrus, and allowed him to return to his biological parents, Cambyses and Mandane.[12] While Herodotus' description may be a legend, it does give insight into the figures surrounding 
2 CONC Cyrus the Great's early life.

2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Media</p>
2 CONT <p>After his father's death in 559 BC, Cyrus became king of Anshan. However, Cyrus was not yet an independent ruler. Like his predecessors, Cyrus had to recognize Mede overlordship. Although the size 
2 CONC of their area of influence is not certainly known, during Astyages' reign the Medes may have ruled over a large part of the Ancient Near East, up to the Lydian frontier to the west, the Parthians to t
2 CONC he east, and the Persians to the south.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Herodotus' version, Harpagus, seeking vengeance, convinced Cyrus to rally the Persian people to revolt against their feudal lords, the Medes. However, it is likely that both Harpagus and Cyrus r
2 CONC ebelled due to their dissatisfaction with Astyages' policies.[9] Herodotus continuous reporting that Harpagus was commander of the Mede army at the time, and, when the revolt occured, he betrayed Asty
2 CONC ages, aiding Cyrus to capture Ecbatana, and effectively conquering the Mede Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This account is corroborated by Babylonian, nearly contemporaneous, sources. The Nabonidus Chronicle states that during the year 550/549 BC [13], the Mede troops revolted and delivered Astyages in 
2 CONC fetters to Cyrus, who captured Ecbatana and brought its treasury to Anshan. The Nabonidus Chronicle date seems to be contradicted by the Sippar Cylinder, which gives the year 554/553 for Astyages' def
2 CONC eat. This apparent contradiction may reflects that the war was longer; 554/543 may indicate the begining of the revolt, and 550/549, Cyrus victory over Ecbatana. [14]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While Cyrus seems to have accepted the crown of Media, by 546 BC, he had officially assumed the title of King of Persia instead. Arsames, who had been the ruler of Persia under the Medes, therefore
2 CONC  had to give up his throne. His son, Hystaspes, who was also Cyrus' second cousin, was then made satrap of Parthia and Phrygia. Arsames would live to see his grandson become Darius the Great, Shahansh
2 CONC ah of Persia, after the deaths of both of Cyrus' sons.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus' conquest of Media was merely the start of his wars. Astyages had been allied with his brother-in-law Croesus of Lydia (son of Alyattes II), Nabonidus of Babylon, and Amasis II of Egypt, who 
2 CONC reportedly intended to join forces against Cyrus and Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Lydia and Asia Minor</p>
2 CONT <p> Croesus was the first ally of Astyages to attack Persia, but was ultimately defeated by Cyrus.The dates of the Lydian conquest are untenable, but it has been generally suggested to have begun in 5
2 CONC 47 BC.[15] The Lydians first attacked the Achaemenid Empire's city of Pteria in Cappadocia. Croesus laid siege to the city, and captured its inhabitants as slaves. Meanwhile, The Persians invited the 
2 CONC citizens of Ionia, who were part of the Lydian kingdom, to revolt against their ruler. The offer was rebuffed, and thus Cyrus levied an army and marched against the Lydians, increasing his numbers whi
2 CONC le passing through nations in his way. The Battle of Pteria was effectively a stalemate, with both sides suffering heavy casualties by nightfall. Croesus retreated to Sardis the following morning.[16]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While in Sardis, Croesus sent out requests for his allies to send aid to Lydia. However, near the end of winter, before the allies could unite, Cyrus pushed the war into Lydian territory and besieg
2 CONC ed Croesus in his capital, Sardis. Shortly before the final battle between the two rulers, Harpagus advised Cyrus to place his dromedaries in front of his warriors; the Lydian horses, not used to the 
2 CONC dromedaries' smell, would be very afraid. The strategy worked; the Lydian cavalry was routed. Cyrus defeated and captured Croesus. Cyrus occupied the capital at Sardis, conquering the Lydian kingdom i
2 CONC n 546 BC.[16] According to Herodotus, Cyrus spared Croesus' life and kept him as an advisor, but this account conflicts with some translations of the contemporary Nabonidus Chronicle, which interpret 
2 CONC that the king of Lydia was slain.[17]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before returning to the capital, a Lydian named Pactyes was entrusted by Cyrus to send Croesus' treasury to Persia. However, soon after Cyrus' departure, Pactyes hired mercenaries and caused an upr
2 CONC ising in Sardis, revolting against the Persian satrap of Lydia, Tabalus. With recommendations from Croesus that he should turn the minds of the Lydian people to luxury, Cyrus sent Mazares, one of his 
2 CONC commanders, to subdue the insurrection, but demanded that Pactyas be returned alive. Upon Mazares' arrival, Pactyas fled to Ionia, where he had hired mercenaries. Mazares marched his troops into the G
2 CONC reek country and captured the cities of Magnesia and Priene, where Pactyas was captured and sent back to Persia for punishment.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mazares continued the conquest of Asia Minor, but died of unknown causes during his campaign in Ionia. Cyrus sent Harpagus to complete Mazares' conquest of Asia Minor. Harpagus captured Lycia, Cili
2 CONC cia and Phoenicia, using the technique of building earthworks to breach the walls of besieged cities, a method unknown to the Greeks. He ended his conquest of the area in 542 BC, and returned to Persi
2 CONC a.[9]

2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Babylonia</p>
2 CONT <p> Superimposed on modern borders, the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus' rule extended approximately from Turkey, Israel, and Azerbaijan in the west to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Pakistan in the east. 
2 CONC Persia became the largest empire the world had ever seen.In 539 BC, towards the end of September, Cyrus' armies, under the command of Gubaru, the governor of Gutium, attacked Opis on the Tigris river 
2 CONC and defeated the Babylonians after a minor uprising. With Opis subjugated, the Persians took control of the vast canal system of Babylonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On October 10, the city of Sippar was seized without a battle, with little to no resistance from the populace. It is probable that Cyrus engaged in negotiations with the Babylonian generals to obta
2 CONC in a compromise on their part and therefore avoid an armed confrontation.[18] Nabonidus was staying in the city at the time, and soon fled to the capital, Babylon, which he had not visited in years.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Two days later, on October 12, Gubaru's troops entered Babylon, again without any resistance from the Babylonian armies. Herodotus explains that to accomplish this feat, the Persians diverted the E
2 CONC uphrates river into a canal so that the water level dropped "to the height of the middle of a man's thigh," which allowed the invading forces to march directly through the river bed to enter at night.
2 CONC [19] On October 29, Cyrus himself entered the city of Babylon and arrested Nabonidus. He then assumed the titles of "king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four sides of the world."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prior to Cyrus' invasion of Babylon, the Babylonian Empire had conquered many kingdoms. In addition to Babylonia itself, Cyrus incorporated its subnational entities into his Empire, including Syria
2 CONC  and Palestine.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before leaving Babylon, Cyrus also freed the Israelites by allowing them to return to their native land, effectively ending the Babylonian captivity. The return of the exiles reinforced the Jewish 
2 CONC population in their homeland, which had been waning since the start of the Babylonian rule.[20]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great, Cyrus' dominions must have comprised the largest empire the world had ever seen. At the end of Cyrus' rule, the Achaemenid Empire stretche
2 CONC d from Asia Minor and Judah in the west to the Indus River in the east.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Death</p>
2 CONT <p>Ctesias reports only that Cyrus met his death in the year 529 BC, while warring against tribes north-east of the headwaters of the Tigris. In Herodotus' account, Cyrus met his fate in a fierce batt
2 CONC le with the Massagetae, a tribe from the southern deserts of Kharesm and Kizilhoum in the southernmost portion of the steppe region, after ignoring advice from his advisor, Croesus, to not continue fo
2 CONC rward.[21] The Massagetae were related to the Scythians in their dress and mode of living; they fought on horseback and on foot.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p> Cyrus' tomb lies in the ruins of Pasargadae, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The queen of the Massagetae, Tomyris, who had assumed control after Cyrus had defeated Tomyris' son Spargapises, led t
2 CONC he attack. The Persian forces suffered heavy casualties, including Cyrus himself. After the battle, Tomyris ordered the body of Cyrus to be found, and then dipped his head in blood to avenge the death
2 CONC  of her son at his hands.[22]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus was buried in the city of Pasargadae, where his tomb remains today. Both Strabo and Arrian give descriptions of his tomb, based on eyewitness reports from the time of Alexander the Great's in
2 CONC vasion. Though the city itself is now in ruins, the burial place of Cyrus the Great has remained largely intact; and the tomb has been partially restored to counter its natural deterioration over the 
2 CONC years.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Cyrus' death, his eldest son, Cambyses II, succeeded him as king of Persia. His younger son, Smerdis, died before Cambyses left to invade the eastern front. From Herodotus' account, Cambyses 
2 CONC killed his brother to avoid a rebellion in his absence. Cambyses continued his father's policy of expansion, and managed to capture Egypt for the Empire, but soon died, after only seven years of rule.
2 CONC  An imposter named Gaumata, claiming to be Smerdis, became the sole ruler of Persia for seven months, until he was killed by Darius the Great, the grandson of Arsames, who ruled Persia before Cyrus' r
2 CONC ise.

2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Herodotus</p>
2 CONT <p>Herodotus wrote a century after Cyrus, in Athens and in Sicily. We have no idea what his sources on Persia were. He has a great deal of Persian court gossip, mostly from Xerxes's time; he has also 
2 CONC a list of the satrapies, which he ascribes to Darius, and a roster of Xerxes' army. These last may be based on Persian documents, although they are slightly inconsistent with each other.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He tells several vivid stories about Cyrus, some of which have been told about other kings before and after him.

2 CONT <p>Legacy</p>
2 CONT <p> Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Hebrew pilgrims to resettle and rebuild Jerusalem, earning him an honored place in Judaism.Cyrus was distinguished equally as a statesman and as a soldier. By pu
2 CONC rsuing a policy of generosity instead of repression, and by favoring local religions, he was able to make his newly conquered subjects into enthusiastic supporters.[23] Due in part to the political in
2 CONC frastructure he created, the Achaemenid empire endured long after his demise.

2 CONT <p>Religion</p>
2 CONT <p>Main articles: Cyrus in the Judeo-Christian tradition and Cyrus the Great in the Qur'an
2 CONT <p>A good example of his religious policy is his treatment of the Jews in Babylon. The Bible records that a remnant of the Jewish population returned to the Promised Land from Babylon, following an ed
2 CONC ict from Cyrus to rebuild the temple. This edict is fully reproduced in the Book of Ezra. As a result of Cyrus' policies, the Jews honored him as a dignified and righteous king. He is the only Gentile
2 CONC  to be designated as a messiah, a divinely-appointed king, in the Tanakh.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Politics and philosophy</p>
2 CONT <p>During his reign, Cyrus maintained control over a vast region of kingdoms by organizing the empire into provinces called satrapies. The provincial administrators, vassal kings called satraps, enjoy
2 CONC ed considerable autonomy. Cyrus demanded only tribute and conscripts from many parts of the realm.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus' conquests began a new era in the age of empire building where a large superstate, comprising many dozens of countries, races, and languages, were ruled under a single administration headed b
2 CONC y a central government.[24] This system of satrapies lasted for centuries, and was retained both by the Greek Seleucid dynasty during their control of Iran and later by the Persian Parthians and Sassa
2 CONC nids.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Cyropaedia of Xenophon, a novel about the Great King's life, forms a treatise on politics, much read through the Renaissance, and indeed through the eighteenth century.[25] The book influenced 
2 CONC Sir Thomas Browne, who named his hermetic 1658 discourse, entitled The Garden of Cyrus, after the ruler. With its abundant use of metaphors, Browne characterizes many ancients as "vegetables", with Cy
2 CONC rus as "the splendid and regular planter".[26]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Even today, Cyrus is still cited as an important figure. In 1992, he was ranked #87 on Michael H. Hart's list of the most influential figures in history. On December 10, 2003, in her acceptance of 
2 CONC the Nobel Peace Prize, Shirin Ebadi evoked Cyrus, saying:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I am an Iranian, a descendant of Cyrus the Great. This emperor proclaimed at the pinnacle of power 2,500 years ago that he 'would not reign over the people if they did not wish it.' He promised not
2 CONC  to force any person to change his religion and faith and guaranteed freedom for all. The Charter of Cyrus the Great should be studied in the history of human rights.[27]

2 CONT <p>Cyrus Cylinder</p>
2 CONT <p> The Cyrus Cylinder artifact was inscribed in Babylonian cuneiform at Cyrus' command after his conquest of Babylon.Main article: Cyrus Cylinder
2 CONT <p>Upon taking Babylon, Cyrus issued a declaration inscribed on a clay barrel, known today as the Cyrus Cylinder. It recounts his victories and merciful acts, and documents his royal lineage. It was d

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The cylinder reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where, as early as the third millennium BC, kings such as Urukagina began their reigns with declarations of reforms, the cylinder of Cyrus has 
2 CONC been referred to, as above, as the "first charter of human rights"; though such a concept would have been alien to Cyrus and his contemporaries.[28] In 1971, the United Nations translated and publishe

2 CONT <p>Cyrus 2 the Great</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Persian: korosh or khorvash</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(600?- 530 BCE) Persian king (550- 530 BCE) and part of the Achaemenid Dynasty. We do not know whether Cyrus was a title or a personal name.
2 CONT <p>Cyrus was undoubtedly a clever leader and a great military leader. He appears also to have been a mild leader. Greek historians present him as a good ruler, generous, tolerant and in many cases mil
2 CONC d. On the cylinder on the photo he has recorded the first declaration of human rights. In the Bible he is mentioned as the king that allowed the Jews living in Babylonia to return to Israel.
2 CONT <p>Cyrus chose to respected the culture and religion of the people he conquered. He also had several capitals; Ectabana, Pasargadae and Babylon as winter capital. As he conquered new lands, he did not
2 CONC  call these Persia (or Anshan) or provinces of Persia but he added them to the list of lands he ruled as a king.
2 CONT <p>Cyrus gave the different lands of the empire status as provinces, called satrapies. The satraps enjoyed great independence, and many of them were guilty of nothing more than paying part of their ta
2 CONC x income and contributing with soldiers to the army.
2 CONT <p>Cyrus is often ranked as the first great king of Persia, and the one who made it into an empire though his great conquests. The kingdom he inherited was Anshan, corresponding to southwestern Iran.
2 CONT <p>BIOGRAPHY</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>600 BCE?: Born as son of King Cambyses 1, and according to legends, grandson of King Astyages of Medes. Other suggestions to his birth year go as late as 580.
2 CONT <p>558: Cyrus becomes king over Anshan.</p>
2 CONT <p>550: Leads a rebellion against the Medes and his alleged grandfather King Astyages, adding Medes to his own kingdom.
2 CONT <p>— Becomes ruler over the Persian Empire.</p>
2 CONT <p>546: Defeats Lydia and its king, Croesus after a surprise attack on the capital, Sardis.
2 CONT <p>539 October Takes control over the territories of the Babylonian Empire (including Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine), after defeating King Nabonidus at Otis. The victory is recorded on a cylinder (
2 CONC see photo) with cuneiform writing, which has survived into modern times.
2 CONT <p>530's: Leads several campaigns to east, the lands that represent important parts of modern Iran.
2 CONT <p>530: Makes his son Cambyses 2 co-regent and embarks on a campaign against Queen Massangtae in the east.
2 CONT <p>528: Cyrus dies and is buried at Pasargadae.</p>

2 CONT <p>Cambyses I the Elder (c. 600 – 559 BC) was King of Anshan from c. 580 to 559 BC and was the father of Cyrus II (Cyrus the Great. His name in Greek was ?aµß?s??, whence the Latin Cambyses.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cambyses was an early member of the Achaemenid dynasty. He was apparently a great-grandson of its founder Achaemenes, grandson of Teispes of Anshan and son of Cyrus I of Anshan. His paternal uncle 
2 CONC reigned as Ariaramnes of Persia and his first cousin as Arsames of Persia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Herodotus, Cambyses was "a man of good family and quiet habits". He reigned under the overlordship of Astyages, King of Media. He was reportedly married to Princess Mandane of Media, a
2 CONC  daughter to Astyages and Princess Aryenis of Lydia. His wife was reportedly a granddaughter to both Cyaxares of Media and Alyattes II of Lydia. The result of their marriage was the birth of his succe
2 CONC ssor Cyrus the Great.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Herodotus, Astyages chose Cambyses as a son-in-law because he considered him to pose no threat to the Medean throne. This was not the case with Cyrus II who would grow to depose his gr

2 CONT <p>(relief from Persepolis; ©***) Media (Old Persian Mâda): old, tribal kingdom in the west of modern Iran; capital Ecbatana (modern Hamadan).
2 CONT <p>Media poses a problem to the scholar who tries to describe this ancient empire: the evidence is unreliable. It consists of the archaeological record, several references in Assyrian and Babylonian c
2 CONC uneiform texts, the Persian Behistun inscription, the Histories by the Greek researcher Herodotus of Halicarnassus, the Persian history by Ctesias of Cnidus, and a couple of chapters in the Bible. The
2 CONC  trouble is that the archaeological record is unclear, that the oriental texts offer not much information, that the Greek authors are unreliable, and that several Biblical books appear to have been in
2 CONC fluenced by Herodotus. But let's start with a description of the landscape itself.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The country</p>
2 CONT <p>Although the boundaries of Media were never completely fixed, it is more or less identical to the northwest of modern Iran. Its capital Ecbatana is modern Hamadan; its western part is dominated by 
2 CONC the Zagros mountains and border on Assyria; to the south are Elam and Persis; in the arid east, the Caspian Gate is the boundary with Parthia; and Media is separated from the Caspian Sea and Armenia b

2 CONT <p>The Nisaean plain (©***)</p>
2 CONT <p>The country was (and is) dominated by the east-west route that was, in the Middle Ages, known as the Silk road; it connected Media to Babylonia, Assyria, Armenia, and the Mediterranean in the west,
2 CONC  and to Parthia, Aria, Bactria, Sogdia, and China in the east. Another important road connected Ecbatana with the capitals of Persis, like Persepolis and Pasargada
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Media controlled the east-west trade, but was also rich in agricultural products. The valleys and plains in the Zagros are fertile, and Media was well-known for clover (which is still called medica
2 CONC go), sheep, goats, and the horses of the Nisaean plain. The country could support a large population and boasted many villages and a few cities (Ecbatana, Rhagae, Gabae). The Greek author Polybius of 
2 CONC Megalopolis correctly calls it the most powerful of all Asian countries, and it was generally recognized as one of the most important parts of the Seleucid and Parthian Empires.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Early history</p>
2 CONT <p>Media is archaeologically poorly understood. Often, researchers have simply called those objects Median that were discovered under the stratum they had identified as Achaemenid. It would have been 
2 CONC helpful if we could establish that certain types of archaeological remains (like house forms, ornaments, pottery, and burial rites) in the entire area of Media constantly recurred together, but until 
2 CONC now this definition of a material culture has not been possible.
2 CONT <p>Still, it is reasonably clear that in the first quarter of the first millennium, nomadic cattle-herders speaking an Indo-Iranian language infiltrated the Zagros and settled among the native populat
2 CONC ion. (The language of the newcomers can be reconstructed from loan words, personal names and toponyms.) The tribal warriors are mentioned for the first time in the Assyrian Annals as enemies of Shalma
2 CONC neser III (858-824). KUR Ma-da-a ("the land of the Medes") included the Zagros, "bordered on the salt desert" and "continued as far as the edge of Mount Bikni" (i.e., Mount Damavand, east of Tehran); 
2 CONC its inhabitants were divided into several smaller tribes, and although the Assyrian kings were able to subdue several of them, they never conquered all of Media.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In fact, it is likely that the Assyrians were themselves responsible for the unification of the Median tribes. The repeated Assyrian attacks forced the various inhabitants of the Zagros and the cou
2 CONC ntry beyond to cooperate and develop more effective leadership. The Assyrians also appreciated products from the east, like Bactrian lapis lazuli, and the east-west route through Media became increasi
2 CONC ngly important. Tribal chiefs along the road could make substantial profits if only they were willing to give up their nomadic way of life and settle in more permanent residences. Trade may explain th
2 CONC e rise of Ecbatana (Hâgmatâna, 'gathering place' ) as central town of Media, and may have been the trigger that started the process of unification. Other towns that may have grown as a response to t
2 CONC he demands of the Assyrian market are Hasanly and Ziwiye in the northwes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Empire?</p>
2 CONT <p>If we are to believe Herodotus, Media was unified by a man named Deioces, the first of four kings who were to rule a true empire that included large parts of Iran and eastern Anatolia. Their names 
2 CONC sound convincingly Median: a Daiaukku and a Uksatar (Deioces and Cyaxares) are mentioned in texts from the eighth century. Using the number of regnal years mentioned by the Greek researcher and counti
2 CONC ng backward from the year in which the last Median leader (who is mentioned in the Babylonian Nabonidus Chronicle) lost his throne, we obtain this list:
2 CONT <p>  Deioces 53 years 700/699 to 647/646</p>
2 CONT <p>Phraortes 22 years 647/646 to 625/624</p>
2 CONT <p>Cyaxares 40 years 625/624 to 585/584</p>
2 CONT <p>Astyages 35 years 585/584 to 550/549</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Unfortunately, there are several problems. In the first place, Ctesias offers another list of kings. Secondly, there is something wrong with the chronology: the Daiaukku and Uksatar mentioned above
2 CONC  lived in c.715. Even worse, Daiaukku lived near Lake Urmia, not in Ecbatana. Besides, the story of Deioces looks suspiciously like a myth or saga about the origins of civilization. Finally, Herodotus
2 CONC ' figures are suspect: (53+22) + (40+35) = 75+75 = 150 years. There is no need to doubt the existence of the two last rulers, who are also mentioned in Babylonian texts, but we may ask what kind of le
2 CONC aders they have been.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>One clue is a little list that Herodotus inserted in his Histories, in which he states that Deioces "united the Medes and was ruler of the tribes which here follow, namely, the Busae, Paretacenians
2 CONC , Struchates, Arizantians, Budians, and Magians" (1.102). But was Deioces the only leader to unite several tribes? It is not a strange or novel idea to interpret the various personal names we have as 
2 CONC an indication of a fluid, still developing central leadership.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Herodotus' list can be seen as an attempt to create order in a confused oral tradition about earlier leaders; his description of Median history probably projects back aspects of the later, Achaemen
2 CONC id empire upon a loose tribal federation. He took the stories told by his Persian informers about the early history of Iran a bit too literal. Which does not mean that the leaders of tribal federation
2 CONC s were nor capable of exercising great political influence.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although an Arbaces may have united several Median tribes too, Cyaxares and Astyages are generally recognized as the two last rulers of the federation of tribes. According to the so-called Fall of 
2 CONC Nineveh Chronicle, Cyaxares (called Umakishtar) destroyed the Assyrian religious center Aššur in the summer of 614:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Medes went along the Tigris and encamped against Aššur. They did battle against the city and destroyed it. They inflicted a terrible defeat upon a great people, plundered and sacked them. The
2 CONC  king of Babylonia and his army, who had gone to help the Medes, did not reach the battle in time.
2 CONT <p>From this moment on, Cyaxares and the Babylonian king Nabopolassar joined forces, and two years later, the Assyrian capital Nineveh was captured by the allies:
2 CONT <p>The king of Babylonia and Cyaxares [...] encamped against Nineveh. From the month Simanu [May/June] until the month Âbu [July/August] -for three months- they subjected the city to a heavy siege. O
2 CONC n the [lacuna] day of the month Abu they inflicted a major defeat upon a great people. At that time Sin-šar-iškun, king of Assyria, died. They carried off the vast booty of the city and the temple a
2 CONC nd turned the city into a ruin heap. [...] On the twentieth day of the month Ulûlu [10 August 612] Cyaxares and his army went home.
2 CONT <p>This proves that Cyaxares was more than just a tribal chief: he was a real king, capable of building an army that was strong enough to capture a city. Probably, the Persians, Armenians, Parthians, 
2 CONC and Arians all paid tribute to the Medes. In other words, he controlled a large part of the Silk Road and had expanded his realm to Persis and Armenia, which appears to have been brought in submission
2 CONC  after 609 and probably before 605.
2 CONT <p>Cyaxares' latest recorded act is the battle of the Halys, which he fought against the Lydian king Alyattes and can be dated to 30 May 585 BCE. This and the capture of Aššur in 614 fit within Hero
2 CONC dotus' framework, which gives 40 and 35 years to the two last kings, but it is remarkable that Cyaxares was still firmly in charge in 585/584, and had been succeeded by Astyages in 584/583.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>About the reign of Astyages, Herodotus tells an oriental fairy tale, which explains why he lost the throne. However, although the story may be more charming than reliable, the fact that Astyages lo
2 CONC st his kingdom is confirmed by the Chronicle of Nabonidus, where we read that in the sixth year of the Babylonian king Nabonidus (550/549)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>king Astyages called up his troops and marched against Cyrus, king of Anšan [i.e., Persia], in order to meet him in battle. The army of Astyages revolted against him and delivered him in fetters t
2 CONC o Cyrus. Cyrus marched against the country Ecbatana; the royal residence he seized; silver, gold, other valuables of the country Ecbatana he took as booty and brought to Anšan.
2 CONT <p>It is possible that the rise of Persia and the demise of Media had deeper, economic causes. It seems that in the mid-sixth century, qanats were dug in Persis, which gave this part of Iran a compete
2 CONC tive advantage compared to Media. However, dating the villages near qanats is not easy, and it may be that this development in fact postdates Cyrus' victory.
2 CONT <p>Anyhow, Cyrus took over the loosely organized Median empire, including several subject countries: Armenia, Cappadocia, Parthia, and perhaps Aria. They were probably ruled by vassal kings called sat
2 CONC raps. In 547, Cyrus added Lydia to his possessions, a state that had among its vassals the Greek and Carian towns in the west and southwest of what is now Turkey.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Eight years later, he captured Babylon, and Cyrus understood that cities were not only there to be looted by nomads -as Cyaxares had done with Nineveh- but could be integrated in an empire. The Per
2 CONC sian king also founded a city of his own, Pasargadae, and it is not exaggerated to say that the evolution from tribal society to early state that had started in Media, reached its conclusion in Persis

2 CONT <p>The evidence from Daniel</p>
2 CONT <p>In the Biblical book Daniel, we encounter a famous summary of the history of the ancient Near East: the vision of the four beasts (text), which all represent an eastern monarchy that dominated the 
2 CONC sacred city of Babylon.
2 CONT <p>The lion with eagle's wings: the Babylonian empire (which existed until 539 BCE). The image is well chosen, because animals like these were depicted in Babylonian art.
2 CONT <p>The bear: the Median empire.</p>
2 CONT <p>The four-headed leopard with fowl's wings: the Achaemenid empire (539-330).
2 CONT <p>The ten-horned beast with iron teeth: the empire of Alexander the Great (336-323). Alexander was often depicted with the ram's horns of his divine father Ammon.
2 CONT <p>There is little doubt about this interpretation, but there is one problem: the Medes were only an important world empire in the Histories of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, who is also the only author 
2 CONC who ignored the difference between Assyria and Babylonia. Elsewhere, the author of Daniel makes a king with the strange name "Darius the Mede" conquer Babylon. As we have already seen, the "real" Mede
2 CONC s were a tribal federation and never captured Babylon. It is very likely that the author of Daniel, who wrote in c.165 BCE, was influenced by the Greek view of history, and gave the Medes more importa
2 CONC nce than they deserved.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Media in the Behistun Inscription</p>
2 CONT <p>However this may be, after 550/549 Media was part of the empire of Cyrus the Great. There must have been resentments against the new rulers, and the Medes revolted when Cyrus's son and successor Ca
2 CONC mbyses had died in 522. He was succeeded by his brother Bardiya, the Smerdis of the Greek sources, who announced that the provinces were for three years released from their obligation to pay tribute a

2 CONT <p>This caused great indignation among the Persian elite, and a distant relative of Bardiya named Darius, together with six conspirators, assassinated the new king. Darius' own story can be read in th
2 CONC e Behistun inscription and is also known from Herodotus' Histories. Both men agree that the man who had been killed was not the lawful ruler Bardiya, but his double, a Magian named Gaumâta. As the "M
2 CONC agians" were not only a group of religious specialists, but also a Median tribe, and the killed man's policy seemed to favor Media, Darius may be right.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Phraortes on the</p>
2 CONT <p>Behistun relief (©**)</p>
2 CONT <p>Whatever Bardiya/Gaumâta's identity, his death meant the beginning of several revolts. In Babylonia, a man named Nidintu-Bêl proclaimed himself king, and when Darius had gone to Babylon, a new re
2 CONC bel leader stood up in Media, Phraortes, who descended from one of the Median kings of old, Cyaxares, and gained support in Sagartia, Parthia and Hyrcania. There were also insurrections in Armenia, El
2 CONC am, and Persis.
2 CONT <p>It looked like a formidable revolt, but Phraortes was defeated by the Persian general Hydarnes on 12 January 521. It was not a decisive Persian victory, however, and Phraortes managed to stand his 
2 CONC ground during the winter, until Darius took charge of the war personally: on 8 May, he defeated the Medians near Kunduruš, which seems to have been the ancient name of modern Kangâvar. The Persian v
2 CONC ictory was complete, and while Darius sacked Ecbatana, Phraortes fled to Rhagae (modern Tehrân), where he was intercepted; the rebel king was crucified in his former capital.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A Sagartian named Tritantaechmes, who also claimed to descend from the Median leader Cyaxares continued the rebellion, but was defeated by Darius' Median general Takhmaspâda. This rebel was crucif
2 CONC ied in Arbela.

2 CONT <p>This was the end of the latest Median insurrection. It seems that the Medes now acquiesced in the rule of their Persian overlord. They had a special position in the Achaemenid Empire, belonging to 
2 CONC the elite. Ecbatana was one of Darius's residences, and in another capital, Persepolis, the Medes are often depicted as equals of the Persians. In the Biblical book Esther, the two nations are juxtapo
2 CONC sed in the famous expression "laws of Medes and Persians". In Greek, the names of the two Iranian nations were used as synonyms: the conflict we know as "Persian war", was known to the Greeks as "Medi
2 CONC an war".
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Later history</p>
2 CONT <p>In the first years after the coup of Darius, the Persian general Hydarnes was satrap of Media. After this, the country more or less disappears from sight. The cuneiform archives of Babylon are less
2 CONC  informative after, say, 480 (which may have something to do with the repression of the revolt of Šamaš-eriba); there are no Assyrian archives; the Persepolis fortification tablets do not reach beyo
2 CONC nd 493; Herodotus's story ends in 479; other Greek authors (e.g., Ctesias of Cnidus, Xenophon) ignored Media; and -finally- of all Achaemenid kings,only Darius left a historical inscription.
2 CONT <p>Archaeological research is not easy, too. We know that Ecbatana was an important city in the Persian age, but not many excavations have been conducted. The Achaemenid kings Darius II Nothus (424-40
2 CONC 4) and Artaxerxes II Mnemon (404-358) have left inscriptions that prove that they were interested in this residence, but this is about everything we know.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Media becomes visible again during the war between the Macedonian king Alexander the Great and his ill-fated Persian opponent Darius III Codomannus. After the latter's defeat at Gaugamela (331), he
2 CONC  tried to reassemble an army at Ecbatana, but in the spring of 330, he was forced to retreat to the east, and was murdered. Alexander initially left control of Media, which was strategically important
2 CONC  as it controlled the Macedonian lines of contact, to his trusted general Parmenion, who, however, was assassinated when Alexander became suspicious of his son Philotas.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It is known that Parmenion and -later- two other Macedonian officers, Sitalces and Cleander, attacked native Zoroastrian sanctuaries. In 325, a local leader named Baryaxes revolted against the new 
2 CONC rulers, but his rebellion was suppressed by Alexander's satrap of Media, Atropates. To restore order, he also had to charge the two officers, who were indeed convicted by Alexander and eventually exec
2 CONC uted.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Alexander in 323, Atropates was removed from office and replaced by a man named Peithon, but he was able to keep the northern part of Media, which was called Atropatene. (Today, 
2 CONC Atropates' name lives on in the name Âzarbayjân, a province in the north of modern Iran that is not to be confused with the former Soviet republic with the same name.) Media Atropatene became one of

2 CONT <p>After the wars of the Diadochi, Media became part of the empire of Seleucus I Nicator, which included parts of Anatolia and Syria, all of Mesopotamia, and the Iranian platform. This meant that Medi
2 CONC a contined to be of the greatest importance: it was quite simply the heart of the Seleucid Empire, as it had been the core of the Achaemenid empire. There are monuments from this period along the Silk
2 CONC  Road (like the charming reclining Heracles at Behistun) and elsewhere.
2 CONT <p>In the course of the second half of the third century, the Parni nomads began to infiltrate Parthia, east of Media, and started to act increasingly independently, calling themselves after the regio

2 CONT <p>For centuries, Media was the center of the Parthian Empire: even though its capitals were at Hecatompylos in Parthia and Ctesiphon in Mesopotamia, the kings always had to pass through Media, and we

2 CONT <p>#I laid hold on the hem of the robe of Sin, king of the gods, night and daytime

2 CONT <p>#which (is) in Harran, the abode of his heart’s delight, he was reconciled, he had

2 CONT <p>#from the border of Egypt (on) the upper sea even to the lower sea</p>

2 CONT <p>#When in my dream, his two hands had been laid on, Sin, king of the gods,
2 CONT <p>#spoke to me thus, " With thee I will put into the hands of Nabu-na’id, thy son, the return of the gods and the habitation of Harran ;

2 CONT <p>#in E-hul-hul the abode of their hearts’ ease with gladness</p>
2 CONT <p>#and rejoicing he let them dwell. What from former times Sin, king of the gods,

2 CONT <p>#who had ever worshipped his godhead, laid hold on the hem of his robe-Sin, king of the gods,
2 CONT <p>#uplifted my head and set upon me a good name in the land,</p>

2 CONT <p>#From the time of Assurbanipal, king of Assyria, until the 9th year</p>

2 CONT <p>#104 years of happiness, with the reverence which Sin, king of the gods,

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the third millennium BCE until medieval times, Harran is mentioned as an important trade center in northern Mesopotamia, situated on the road from the Mediterranean Sea to the heart of Assyria
2 CONC . It is also mentioned as provincial capital in the Assyrian empire (until the late seventh century BCE) and sanctuary of the moon god Sin, well into the third century CE. Other gods venerated in Harr
2 CONC an were Sin's consort Nikkal, the Syrian goddess Atargatis and the Arabian goddess Allat ("Mrs. God"). In the Bible, it is mentioned as one of the towns where Abraham stayed on his voyage from Ur to t
2 CONC he promised land. The well where his grandson Jacob met Rachel is still shown today.

2 CONT <p>Although the town is mentioned as early as 2000 BCE, the city became famous at the end of the seventh century, when the Babylonian king Nabopolassar defeated an Assyrian force on the banks of the E
2 CONC uphrates, south of Harran (25 July 616). In these years, the Assyrian empire was disintegrating, and the Babylonians and the Median leader Cyaxares were unitedly attacking the ancient empire. In 614, 
2 CONC they captured Aššur, and two years later, Nineveh was destroyed.  The end of the two Assyrian capitals, however, was not the end of the war, however. A new king, Aššur-uballit, set up a kingdom in
2 CONC  Harran and defied the Babylonians.
2 CONT <p>But he was no match for Nabopolassar, who, according to the Fall of Nineveh Chronicle, 'marched to Assyria victoriously' in the fifteenth and sixteenth year of his reign (612-609). Aššur-uballit 
2 CONC was forced to leave Harran, but convinced the Egyptians that they had to support his hopeless cause. A large army under command of pharaoh Necho (610-595) advanced to the north. In June 609, Necho and
2 CONC  Aššur-uballit tried to recapture Harran and they close to victory, but they had to lift their siege of Harran in August. This was the end of Assyria, its last capital now being part of the Babyloni
2 CONC an empire.

2 CONT <p>The first half of the sixth century, Babylon was ruled by king Nebuchadnezzar (604-562). This was the age of Babylonian glory and splendor. However, not everything was fine, and in 555 a coup d' é
2 CONC tat took place, which led to the accession of king Nabonidus, an old man, who may in fact have been nothing more than a puppet for the real ruler, his son Belsassar.
2 CONT <p>Nabonidus shocked the religious authorities of Babylon by his dedication to Sin of Harran. A Babylonian king was expected to venerate the supreme god Marduk and take part in the Akitu festival. Nab
2 CONC onidus would have none of it. Instead, he left Babylon and started to live in the Arabian desert (more...). At the same time, he rebuilt the temple of Sin at Harran. Meanwhile, the Babylonians felt be
2 CONC trayed and started to sympathize with king Cyrus of Persia, who had already defeated the Medes and Lydians. When he announced to restore the cult of Marduk, the Babylonians sided with him (October 539
2 CONC ).

2 CONT <p>Harran was now part of the Achaemenid empire, which was replaced two centuries later by that of the Macedonian king Alexander the Great. The conqueror may have visited Harran in the late summer of 
2 CONC 331. After Alexander's death in 323, Harran was part of the empire of the Seleucids, the Macedonian dynasty ruling in Asia. They settled Macedonian veterans at Harran, which remained a recognizable en
2 CONC tity after the Seleucid empire had been replaced by that of the Parthians.
2 CONT <p>In 53 BCE, the Roman general Crassus invaded Parthia. The descendants of the Macedonians sided with him, but nonetheless, he was defeated by a Parthian commander who is called Surena in the Greek a
2 CONC nd Latin sources, and must have been a member of the Parthian Sûrên clan. The battle of Harran -or Carrhae as the Romans called it- was the beginning of a series of border wars that were to last for
2 CONC  almost three centuries.

2 CONT <p>In this period, Harran belonged to a small kingdom called Osrhoene, which was part of the larger Parthian empire and had nearby Edessa as its capital. The Roman emperor Lucius Verus (161-169) tried
2 CONC  to conquer this kingdom and nearby Nisibis and was successful, but an epidemic broke out and made annexation impossible. However, a victory monument was erected in Ephesus, and Harran is shown as one
2 CONC  of the subject towns.
2 CONT <p>The Roman emperor Septimius Severus finally added Osrhoene to his realms in 195. The conic domed houses of ancient Harran, which have remained unchanged until the present day, can be seen on the Ar

2 CONT <p>His successor Caracalla gave Harran the status of colonia (214) and visited the city in April 217, because he wanted to visit the temple of Sin. Instead, he was murdered by the prefect of the Praet
2 CONC orian guard, Macrinus, who was to be the new emperor.
2 CONT <p>The Roman emperor Julian the Apostate sacrificed to Sin in 363, at the beginning of his ill-fated campaign against the Sassanid Persians. From now on, the region was a battle zone between the Roman
2 CONC s and Sassanids. It remained Roman (or Byzantine) until 639, when the city was captured by the Muslim armies.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At that time, the cult of Sin still existed. Another late-antique religion of Harran was Sabianism. Its adherents worshipped Sin, Mars, and Shamal, the lord of the spirits. Women and men had equal 
2 CONC rights, and everyone lived ascetic, refraining from several kinds of meat and groceries. After the arrival of the Islam, they probably went to live in the marshes of the lower Tigris and Euphrates, an

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Cyrus I (Old Persian Kuruš) or Cyrus I of Anshan, was King of Anshan in Persia from c. 600 to 580 BC or, according to others, from c. 652 to 600 BC. He should not be confused with his
2 CONC  famous grandson Cyrus the Great, also known as Cyrus II. His name in Modern Persian is کوروش, while in Greek he was called Κῦρος, Kȳros.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus was an early member of the Achaemenid dynasty. He was apparently a grandson of its founder Achaemenes and son of Teispes, king of Anshan. Teispes' sons reportedly divided the kingdom among th
2 CONC em after his death. Cyrus reigned as king of Anshan while his brother Ariaramnes was king of Parsa.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The chronological placement of this event is uncertain. This is due to his suggested, but still debated identification, with the monarch known as "Kuras of Parsumas". Kuras is first mentioned c. 65
2 CONC 2 BC. At that year Shamash-shum-ukin, king of Babylon (668–648 BC) revolted against his older brother and overlord Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria (668–627 BC). Cyrus is mentioned being in a militar
2 CONC y alliance with the former. The war between the two brothers ended in 648 BC with the defeat and reported suicide of Shamash-shum-ukin.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cyrus is mentioned again in 639 BC. At that year Ashurbanibal managed to defeat Elam and became overlord to several of its former allies. Kuras was apparently among them. His elder son "Arukku" was
2 CONC  reportedly sent to Assyria to pay tribute to its King. Kuras then seems to vanish from historical record. His suggested identification with Cyrus would help connect the Achaemenid dynasty to the majo
2 CONC r events of the 7th century BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ashurbanipal died in 627 BC. Cyrus presumably continued paying tribute to his sons and successors Ashur-etil-ilani (627–623 BC) and Sin-shar-ishkun (623 BC – 612 BC). They were both opposed by 
2 CONC an alliance led by Cyaxares of the Medes (633–584 BC) and Nabopolassar of Babylon (626–605 BC). In 612 BC the two managed to capture the Assyrian capital Nineveh. This was effectively the end of t
2 CONC he Assyrian Empire though remnants of the Assyrian army under Ashur-uballit II (612–609 BC) continued to resist from Harran.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Media and Babylon soon shared the lands previously controlled by the Assyrians. Anshan apparently fell under the control of the former. Cyrus is considered to have ended his days under the overlord
2 CONC ship of either Cyaxares or his son Astyages (584 BC – 550 BC). Cyrus was succeeded by his son Cambyses I. His grandson would come to be known as Cyrus the Great, creator of the Persian Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It has been noted that this account of his life and reign would place his early activities more than a century before those of his grandson. This would place his fathering of Cambyses very late in 
2 CONC life and his death at an advanced age. It has been argued that Kuras and Cyrus were separate figures of uncertain relation to each other. The later would have then reigned in the early 6th century BC 
2 CONC and his reign would seem rather uneventful. Due to the current lack of sufficient records for this historical period it remains uncertain which theory is closer to the facts.

2 CONT <p>Reign</p>
2 CONT <p>Astyages succeeded his father in 585 BCE, following the Battle of Pteria which ended a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to s
2 CONC eal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Median throne upon his father's death later that year.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Astyages inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuc
2 CONC hadnezzar was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The reign of Astyages was noted for its both its stability and for the growth of the easten prophet-based religion, Zoroastrianism throughout his empire, at the same time that Croesus was overseein
2 CONC g an explosion of secular thought in the west (through the philosophers he patronized, Thales, Solon, Aesop...), and Nebuchadnezzar was turning his city of Babylon into the greatest metropololis the w
2 CONC orld had yet seen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After thirty-two years of relative stability, Astyages lost the support of his nobles during the war with Cyrus the Great, resulting in Astyages', Croesus' and Babylon's overthrow and the formation
2 CONC  of the Persian empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Herodotus' account</p>
2 CONT <p>Reported by Herodotus as a vain and superstious king, Astyages was said to have had a dream where his daughter, Mandane gave birth to a son who would destroy his empire. Fearing this to be true, As

2 CONC produce a child incapable of taking his throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When a second dream warned Astyages of the dangers of Mandane's offspring following her marriage to Cambyses I, Astyages sent his courtier and general Harpagus to kill the child, Cyrus II. Harpagus
2 CONC , unwilling to spill his own royal blood, gave the infant to a shepherd, Mitridates, who raised him as his own son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When, at age ten, Cyrus II was found alive, Astyages spared the boy on the advice of his Magi (Zoroastrian priest), returning him to Cambyses II and Mandane in Anshan. Harpagus, however, did not es

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Historical account</p>
2 CONT <p>In 553 BCE, King Cyrus the Great made war on Astyages' Media. After three years of fighting, Astyages' troops mutinied and Astyages was handed over to the enemy. Cyrus then went on to pillage Astya
2 CONC ges's capital of Ecbatana.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While Herodotus relates that the mutiny was instigated by Harpagus, as revenge for the king forcing him to eat his own son, there is no independent verification of such punishment being inflicted u
2 CONC pon Harpagus by Astyages.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Chronicle of Nabonidus of Babylon does refer to a mutiny on the battlefield as the cause for Astyages' overthrow, but does not mention Harpagus by name. However, as Harpagus was Astyages' gener
2 CONC al at the battle of Pasargadae, as his family were granted high positions in Cyrus' empire after the war, and as Harpagus went on to become Cyrus II's most successful general, it is possible he had so
2 CONC mething to do with the mutiny against Astyages.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Though Cyrus II is considered to be Astyages' grandson through his daughter, Mandane, it is not known whether Cyrus II made this claim in order to legitimize his overthrow of Astyages or if he real
2 CONC ly was Astyages' direct descendant.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Astyages' overthrow, Croesus marched on Cyrus II to avenge Astyages. Cyrus II, with Harpagus at his side, defeated Croesus, overthrew Lydia in 547 BCE. Cyrus II's conquests continued with Bab
2 CONC ylon a few years later, combining the three former empires into his new empire of Iran.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ancient sources agree that Astyages was treated with clemency after his capture, but differ in details. Herodotus says that he was imprisoned for the rest of his life, while according to Ctesias, h
2 CONC e was made a governor of a region of Parthia and was later murdered by a political opponent, Oebaras. The actual circumstances of Astyages' death are not known.

2 CONT <p>Two Medes</p>
2 CONT <p>(relief from Persepolis; ©***) Astyages (Akkadian Ištumegu): last king of  Media, son of king Cyaxares, dethroned 550 BCE.
2 CONT <p>Most information on Astyages can be found in the second part of the first book of the Histories by the Greek researcher Herodotus, who lived in the fifth century, hundred years after Astyages' reig
2 CONC n. However, he is almost our only source, and it is inevitable to follow Herodotus' lead and trying to check him where possible.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There is no need to doubt Herodotus' statement that Astyages was the son of the Median king Cyaxares. We know from a cuneiform text that the latter was already king in 614, when he destroyed the As
2 CONC syrian religious center Aššur. Cyaxares was still alive in the summer of 585, when he signed a peace treaty with the Lydians, with whom he had been fighting for five years. A diplomatic marriage was
2 CONC  arranged to celebrate the treaty: Aryenis, a sister of the Lydian king Croesus, was married to the Median crown prince Astyages.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aryenis was not Astyages' first wife. His daughter Mandane was married to the Persian king Cambyses before 576 BCE -when the future king Cyrus the Great was born- and Mandane must have been born be
2 CONC fore, say, 590. It seems inevitable to assume that Astyages had another wife. (There is some doubt about the truth of the marriage between Mandane and Cambyses. According to Ctesias of Cnidus, their s
2 CONC on Cyrus married to a daughter of Astyages. That would be his aunt, which is most unusual.)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There is another argument why Aryenis was not Astyages' first wife. His father had started to reign before 614. If we assume that he had become king at an age of thirty -which is not improbable- an
2 CONC d his son was born when he was twenty-five -which is possible-, we must assume that Astyages married Mandane at the age of at least thirty-four. This is very improbable.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Babylonian historian Berossus (third century BCE) tells us that after the fall of Aššur in 614, an alliance between the Medes and the Babylonians was cemented by another royal wedding: the Ba
2 CONC bylonian crown prince Nebuchadnezzar married Amytis, the daughter of Astyages. This is impossible, because it would suggest that Astyages was almost hundred years old when he was dethroned.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It is unclear when Astyages was elected king of the Medes. Herodotus tells us that he had reigned for thirty-five years when he was taken captive by the Persian king Cyrus. From the cuneiform text 
2 CONC that is known as the Chronicle of Nabonidus, we know that this happened in the sixth year of the Babylonian king Nabonidus, which is the period between 10 March 550 and 28 March 549 (a leap year with 
2 CONC thirteen moons). Counting backwards, we arrive at 585/584 as the year of Astyages' accession. This is not impossible, although we must assume that Astyages' father Cyaxares was still alive in 585, whe
2 CONC n he concluded a peace treaty with the Lydian
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, the regnal years of the Median kings mentioned by Herodotus are a bit suspect: the four kings reign exactly hundred and fifty years, in two pairs of each seventy-five years. It is obvious 
2 CONC that we must be cautious, but up till now, there is nothing to contradict his statement that Astyages reigned from 585/584 to 550/549 and his father Cyaxares from 625/624 to 585/585. (Although it shou
2 CONC ld be noted that there is one inscription that says that Astyages was dethroned in 554/553.)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Herodotus, Astyages had a dream about the son of his daughter Mandane and her husband Cambyses, Cyrus, which he took as an evil omen.  Therefore, Astyages ordered his courtier Harpagus
2 CONC  to kill the young boy, but Harpagus secretly gave it to a herdsman, who was to do the dreadful deed. Fortunately, the herdsman and his wife decided not to kill the baby, but to accept him as their ow
2 CONC n son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When the boy was ten years old, it became obvious that he was not a herdsman's son. His behavior was too noble, according to Herodotus. Astyages started to suspect what had happened when he intervi
2 CONC ewed the boy and noticed that his face resembled his own. He ordered Harpagus to explain what he had done with the baby, and when the courtier confessed that he had not killed Astyages' daughter's chi
2 CONC ld, the king forced him to eat his own son. Cyrus received a favorable treatment and was allowed to go to his own parents, Cambyses and Mandane.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Herodotus, Harpagus was looking for an opportunity to avenge himself. When Cyrus had come of age, Harpagus managed to convince the young man that the Medes were ready to revolt against
2 CONC  their king, who had become a despot. Cyrus organized a federation of ten Persian tribes and revolted, and Astyages 'armed all the Medes, and blinded by divine providence he appointed Harpagus to be t
2 CONC he leader of the army'. Of course, Harpagus did not hesitate to switch allegiance. The united army of Medes and Persians marched to the Median capital and seized Astyages, who was kept captive by Cyru
2 CONC s.

2 CONT <p>The Nabonidus chronicle</p>
2 CONT <p>(British Museum, London; ©***)</p>
2 CONT <p>The first part of Herodotus' story is, of course, an oriental fairy tale. However, the last part of it is confirmed by the Chronicle of Nabonidus, where we read that in the sixth year of the Babylo
2 CONC nian king Nabonidus
2 CONT <p>king Astyages called up his troops and marched against Cyrus, king of Anšan [i.e., Persia], in order to meet him in battle. The army of Astyages revolted against him and in fetters they delivered 
2 CONC him to Cyrus. Cyrus marched against the country Ecbatana; the royal residence he seized; silver, gold, other valuables of the country Ecbatana he took as booty and brought to Anšan.
2 CONT <p> It is possible that the deepest cause of the rebellion of Harpagus was dissatisfaction with Astyages' policy. In the sixth century, the Iranian tribes became more and more settled, and their kings
2 CONC  were no longer the first among equal tribal chiefs, but started to behave as real kings. When Astyages started to punish one of the other tribal chiefs, revolt was inevitable.
2 CONT <p>The fall of Astyages was not the end of the war, however, because Astyages' allies were prepared to help him. According to Herodotus, the
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>destruction of the kingdom of Astyages [...] and the increasing power of the Persians forced [the king of Lydia] Croesus to cut short the power of the Persians, if this were still possible, while i
2 CONC t was too late. (Histories 1.46)
2 CONT <p>In 547 BCE, Croesus launched an expedition against the Persians to avenge his brother-in-law. However, he was defeated; Cyrus added Lydia to his dominions.
2 CONT <p>The Greek historian Ctesias (c.400 BCE), as quoted by the Byzantine scholar Photius (Summaries 72, 36a9), calls Astyages 'Astuïgas', which is closer to the Babylonian rendering of his Iranian name
2 CONC  Ištumegu. The variant 'Astyages' means 'sacker of cities' in Greek.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hvakhshathra or Cyaxares or Kayxosrew (r. 625 - 585 BC) was the most capable king of Media (Iran).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He reorganized and modernized the Median Army, then joined with King Nabopolassar of Babylon. This alliance was formalized through the marriage of Cyaxares daughter, Amytis with Nabopolassar's son,
2 CONC  Nebuchadnezzar II, the king who constructed the Hanging Gardens of Babylon as a present for his Median wife to help with her homesickness for the mountainous country of her birth.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>These allies overthrew the Assyrian Empire and destroyed Nineveh in 612 BC. After this victory, the Medes conquered Northern Mesopotamia, Armenia and the parts of Asia Minor east of the Halys River
2 CONC , which was the border established with Lydia after a decisive battle between Lydia and Media, the Battle of Halys ended with an eclipse on May 28, 585 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The conflict between Lydia and the Medes was reported by Herodotus as follows:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"A horde of the nomad Scythians at feud with the rest withdrew and sought refuge in the land of the Medes: and at this time the ruler of the Medes was Kyaxares the son of Phraortes, the son of Deï
2 CONC okes, who at first dealt well with these Scythians, being suppliants for his protection; and esteeming them very highly he delivered boys to them to learn their speech and the art of shooting with the
2 CONC  bow. Then time went by, and the Scythians used to go out continually to the chase and always brought back something; till once it happened that they took nothing, and when they returned with empty ha
2 CONC nds Kyaxares (being, as he showed on this occasion, not of an eminently good disposition) dealt with them very harshly and used insult towards them. And they, when they had received this treatment fro
2 CONC m Kyaxares, considering that they had suffered indignity, planned to kill and to cut up one of the boys who were being instructed among them, and having dressed his flesh as they had been wont to dres
2 CONC s the wild animals, to bear it to Kyaxares and give it to him, pretending that it was game taken in hunting; and when they had given it, their design was to make their way as quickly as possible to Al
2 CONC yattes the son of Sadyattes at Sardis. This then was done; and Kyaxares with the guests who ate at his table tasted of that meat, and the Scythians having so done became suppliants for the protection 
2 CONC of Alyattes.
2 CONT <p>After this, since Alyattes would not give up the Scythians when Kyaxares demanded them, there had arisen war between the Lydians and the Medes lasting five years; in which years the Medes often dis
2 CONC comfited the Lydians and the Lydians often discomfited the Medes (and among others they fought also a battle by night): and as they still carried on the war with equally balanced fortune, in the sixth
2 CONC  year a battle took place in which it happened, when the fight had begun, that suddenly the day became night. And this change of the day Thales the Milesian had foretold to the Ionians laying down as 
2 CONC a limit this very year in which the change took place. The Lydians however and the Medes, when they saw that it had become night instead of day, ceased from their fighting and were much more eager bot
2 CONC h of them that peace should be made between them. And they who brought about the peace between them were Syennesis the Kilikian and Labynetos the Babylonian: these were they who urged also the taking 
2 CONC of the oath by them, and they brought about an interchange of marriages; for they decided that Alyattes should give his daughter Aryenis to Astyages the son of Kyaxares, since without the compulsion o
2 CONC f a strong tie agreements are apt not to hold strongly together." (Histories, 1.73-74, trans. Macaulay)
2 CONT <p>Cyaxares died soon after the battle and was succeeded by his son, Astyages, who was the maternal grandfather of Cyrus the Great through his daughter Mandane of Media.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 CONT <p>Cyaxares (Persian Uvakhšatara, Akkadian Umakishtar): name of a king of the Medes, who may have reigned from c.625 to c.585.
2 CONT <p>The only narrative about the reign of Cyaxares can be found in the first book of the Histories by the Greek researcher Herodotus (c.480-c.429). He writes that the Median leader Phraortes
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>was succeeded by his son Cyaxares, grandson of Deioces. This prince had a far greater military reputation than his father or grandfather. It was he who first organized the Asiatic armies by dividin
2 CONC g them into separate units - spearmen, archers, and cavalry. Previously the different arms had all been mixed up in a mob. [...] It was he who united all Asia beyond the Halys under his rule.
2 CONT <p>   The first act of his reign was to march against [the Assyrian capital] Nineveh at the head of all his subject nations, with the object of destroying the town and avenging his father [who had bee
2 CONC n killed during a campaign against the Assyrians]. He fought a successful battle against the Assyrians, but while he was besieging the town he was attacked by a large Scythian army under the command o
2 CONC f king Madyas, son of Protothyes. [...] A battle was fought, in which the Medes were defeated and lost their power in Asia, which was taken over in its entirety  by the Scythians.
2 CONT <p>[Histories 1.103;</p>
2 CONT <p>tr. Aubrey de Selincourt]</p>
2 CONT <p>The reign of the Scythians in Asia was to last twenty-eight years, according to Herodotus. This is very unlikely; the Scythians were nomads from modern Ukraine and although they were fierce warrior
2 CONC s, they were incapable of ruling large territories for a long period. This does not mean that the Scythian invasion is unhistorical; Herodotus tells that they reached Ascalon in Palestine, where the E
2 CONC gyptian pharaoh Psammetichus (664-610) bribed them to turn back. There is nothing implausible about this story, except for the duration of the Scythian invasion (which will be explained below).
2 CONT <p>At last Cyaxares and the Medes invited the greater number of the Scythians to a banquet, at which they made them drunk and murdered them, and in this way recovered their former power and dominion. 
2 CONC They captured Nineveh [...] and subdued the Assyrians. [...] Then Cyaxares died, after a reign [...] of forty years. He was succeeded by his son Astyages.
2 CONT <p>[Herodotus, Histories 1.106]</p>
2 CONT <p>We possess a cuneiform text about the final days of the Assyrian empire. According to this so-called Fall of Nineveh Chronicle, Cyaxares (called Umakishtar) destroyed the Assyrian religious center 
2 CONC Aššur in the summer of 614.
2 CONT <p>The Medes went along the Tigris and encamped against Aššur. They did battle against the city and destroyed it. They inflicted a terrible defeat upon a great people, plundered and sacked them. The
2 CONC  king of Babylonia and his army, who had gone to help the Medes, did not reach the battle in time.
2 CONT <p>From this moment on, Cyaxares and the Babylonian king Nabopolassar joined forces. The Babylonian historian Berossus (third century BCE) writes that the alliance was cemented by a marriage: the Baby
2 CONC lonian crown prince Nebuchadnezzar married Amytis, the daughter of Cyaxares' son Astyages. This is impossible (Astyages was too young); probably, Amytis was a daughter of Cyaxares himself. Two years l
2 CONC ater, Nineveh was captured by the two armies:
2 CONT <p>The king of Babylonia mustered his army and marched to [lacuna]. The king of the Medes marched towards the king of Babylonia. They met one another. The king of Babylonia and Cyaxares [...] encamped
2 CONC  against Nineveh. From the month Simanu [May/June] until the month Âbu [July/August] -for three months- they subjected the city to a heavy siege. On the [lacuna] day of the month Abu they inflicted a
2 CONC  major defeat upon a great people. At that time Sin-šar-iškun, king of Assyria, died. They carried off the vast booty of the city and the temple and turned the city into a ruin heap. [...] On the tw
2 CONC entieth day of the month Ulûlu [10 August 612] Cyaxares and his army went home.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Halys (©***) In the first fragment of this article (above), Herodotus tells us that 'it was Astyages who united all Asia beyond the Halys under his rule.' The reality behind this remark is tha
2 CONC t the Persians, Armenians, Parthians, and Arians all paid tribute to the Medes. Their vassal kings were called 'satraps' (khšaçapavan, 'protectors of the realm'). Only the conquest of Armenia can be
2 CONC  dated: it took place after 609 and probably before 605.
2 CONT <p>The growth of the Median power worried king Alyattes of Lydia, a kingdom in the west of modern Turkey. Herodotus writes that there was a diplomatic incident in which some Scythians were involved, a
2 CONC nd continues:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p> War continued for five years, during which both Lydians and Medes won a number of victories. On one occasion they had an unexpected battle in the dark, an event which occurred after five years of 
2 CONC indecisive warfare: the two armies had already engaged and the fight was in progress, when the day was suddenly turned into night.  This change of daylight into darkness had been foretold to the Ionia
2 CONC ns by Thales of Miletus, who fixed the date for it in the year in which it did, in fact, take place.
2 CONT <p>   Both Lydians and Medes broke off the engagement when they saw this darkening of the day; they were more anxious than they had been to conclude peace, and a reconciliation was brought about by Sy
2 CONC ennesis, a Cilician, and Labynetus of Babylon, who were the men responsible both for the pact to keep the peace and for the exchange of marriages between the two kingdoms. They persuaded Alyattes to g
2 CONC ive his daughter Aryenis to Astyages, son of Cyaxares - knowing that treaties seldom remain intact without powerful sanctions.
2 CONT <p>[Histories 1.74]</p>
2 CONT <p>Syennesis was the title of the king of Cilicia; the Labynetus mentioned in this fragment probably is the later king of Babylon, Nabonidus (ruled 556-539). The solar eclipse can be dated to 28 May 5
2 CONC 85 BCE.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It may be noted that this battle took place in the twenty-eighth year after the fall of Nineveh. It is likely that Herodotus' statement that the Scythians ruled Asia for twenty-eight years is deriv
2 CONC ed from confusion of two pieces of information: a Scythian raid during the war against Assyria and the diplomatic incident that led to the war between the Medes and the Lydians.
2 CONT <p>All in all, we can be certain about three events during Cyaxares' reign: the destruction of Aššur in the summer 614, the capture of Nineveh in July 612 and the battle against the Medes on 28 May 
2 CONC 585.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This fits neatly into the chronological framework of Herodotus' Histories, where we read that Cyaxares reigned for forty years and his son Astyages for thirty-five. We know for certain that Astyage
2 CONC s was defeated by the Persian king Cyrus the Great in the sixth year of his Babylonian colleague Nabonidus, i.e., between 10 March 550 and 28 March 549. Counting backward, we arrive at 625/624 to 585/
2 CONC 584 as the regnal years of Cyaxares. This suggests that Cyaxares died almost immediately after the battle against the Medes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under Cyaxares, the Median empire reached its greatest extent, but under his son Astyages, it was destroyed. When in 522 BCE a Mede with the name Phraortes and a Sagartian named Tritantaechmes revo
2 CONC lted against the Persian king Darius I the Great, they both claimed to be a descendant of Cyaxares, even though the great king was dead for more than sixty years.

2 CONT <p>=From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenes Wikipedia]=</p>
2 CONT <p>Achaemenēs (/əˈkɛməniːz/; from Ancient Greek: Ἀχαιμένης, Old Persian: ��𐎧𐎠𐎶𐎴𐎡𐏁 Haxāmaniš) was the eponymous ancestor of the Achaemenid Dynasty, who ruled sou
2 CONC thern Iran between 705 BC and 675 BC.
2 CONT <p>==History==</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ancient Greek writers provide some legendary information about Achaemenes: they call his tribe the Pasargadae, and say that he was "raised by an eagle". Plato, when writing about the Persians, iden
2 CONC tified Achaemenes with Perses, ancestor of the Persians in Greek mythology. '''According to Plato, Achaemenes/Perses was the son of the Ethiopian queen Andromeda and the Greek hero Perseus, and a gran
2 CONC dson of Zeus.''' Later writers believed that Achaemenes and Perses were different people, and that Perses was an ancestor of the king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Persian and Greek sources state that Achaemenes was succeeded by his son Teispes, who would lead the Persians to conquer and settle in the Elamite city of Anshan in southern Iran. Teispes' great-gr
2 CONC andson Cyrus conquered the Medes and established the Persian Empire. Teispes is referred to as a son of Achaemenes in the Old Persian texts at Behistun.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As the eponymous ancestor of the clan, Achaemenes is very often held to be legendary. Achaemenes is generally known as the leader of one of the clans, known to the Greeks as the Pasargadae (althoug
2 CONC h this identification may been due to a confusion with the Persian Imperial capital city Pasargadae begun by [https://www.geni.com/people/Cyrus-II-the-Great-King-of-Persia/6000000003897579982   '''Cyr
2 CONC us the Great] around 546 BC), that was one of the some ten to fifteen Persian tribes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Persian royal inscriptions such as the Behistun Inscription place him five generations before [https://www.geni.com/people/Darius-I-the-Great-King-of-Persia/6000000006131567298    '''Darius the Gre
2 CONC at]. Therefore, according to the Inscriptions, Achaemenes may have lived around 700 BC. The inscriptions do label him as a "king", which may mean that he was the first official king of the Persians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Apart from Persian royal inscriptions, there are very limited historical sources on Achaemenes; therefore very little, if anything at all, is known for certain about him. It has been proposed that 
2 CONC Achaemenes may merely have been a "mythical ancestor of the Persian royal house". The "Babylonian" Cyrus Cylinder, ascribed to Cyrus the Great, does not mention Achaemenes in an otherwise-detailed gen
2 CONC ealogy. Some historians hold that perhaps Achaemenes was a retrograde creation of Darius the Great, made in order to legitimize his connection with Cyrus the Great, after Darius rose to the position o
2 CONC f Shah (i.e. King) of Persia in 522 BC (by killing the usurper Gaumata, the so-called "False Smerdis", who had proclaimed himself King upon the death of Darius' predecessor, Cambyses II; according to 
2 CONC Darius, Gaumata was an impostor pretending to be Cambyses II's younger, deceased brother Bardiya). Darius certainly had much to gain in having an ancestor shared by Cyrus and himself, and may have fel
2 CONC t the need for a stronger connection than that provided by his subsequent marriage to Cyrus' daughter Atossa. An inscription from Pasargadae, also ascribed to Cyrus, does mention Cyrus' descent from A
2 CONC chaemenes; however, historian Bruce Lincoln has suggested that these inscriptions of Cyrus in Pasargadae were engraved during the reign of Darius in c. 510.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Persian royal dynasty from Darius onward revered Achaemenes and credited him as the founder of their dynasty. Very little, however, was remembered about his life or actions. Assuming he existed
2 CONC , Achaemenes was most likely a 7th-century BC warrior-chieftain, or the probable first king, who led the Persians, or a tribe of Persians, as a vassal of the Median Empire. An Assyrian inscription fro
2 CONC m the time of King Sennacherib in 691 BC, mentions that the Assyrian king almost repelled an attack by Parsuamash and Anzan, with the Medians and others on the city of Halule. Historians contend that 
2 CONC if he existed, Achaemenes had to be one of the commanders, leading his Persians with the independent troops of Anshan, during the indecisive Battle of Halule in 691 BC.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Achaemenes (Hakaimanish) was the eponymous ancestor of the royal house of the first Persian Empire, the Achaemenid dynasty. He lived about 2,700 years ago. His name comes from the Old Persian Hakha
2 CONC manish, meaning "friendly in nature." The name's Hellenized form is Achaimenes, which has become rendered in English as Achaemenes. Achaemenes did not rule all of Iran, but a small place in the northw
2 CONC estern part of the country near Lake Urmia, which Assyrian inscriptions call Parsumash, or land of the Parsu or Persians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Achaemenes' royal descendants revered him and credited him as the founder of their dynasty, but very little was ever remembered about his specific achievements. Most likely he was a warrior chiefta
2 CONC in who led the Persians, or a tribe of Persians, as a vassal of the Median Empire. An Assyrian inscription from the time of King Sennacherib mentions that the Assyrian king repelled a raid by the Pars
2 CONC u, who may have been led by Achaemenes. Ancient Greek writers provide some other legendary information: they call his tribe the Pasargadae and say that he was raised by an eagle. Plato, when writing a
2 CONC bout the Persians, oddly speculated that Achaemenes was the son of the Greek hero Perseus and a grandson of Zeus. He might have confused Achaemenes with Perses, son of Perseus by Andromeda and ancesto
2 CONC r of the Persians in Greek mythology. Perses was probably a legendary ancestor of Achaemenes himself from the viewpoint of later writers.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Achaemenes was succeeded by his son Teispes, who would lead the Persians to conquer and settle in the city of Anshan. His great-grandson was Cyrus II, who conquered the Medes and established the Pe
2 CONC rsian Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Due to the lack of hard information on Achaemenes, it has been contended that epigraphic evidence for his existence and rule is highly suspect; in fact, he may have been a Persian legend or an inve
2 CONC ntion of Darius the Great.

2 CONT <p>Shamash-shum-ukin</p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Shamash-shum-ukin was king of Babylon from 669-648 BC. He was the second son of the Assyrian King Esarhaddon. His elder brother, crown prince Sin-iddina-apla had died in 672, and in his stead the t
2 CONC hird son Assurbanipal was invested as crown prince and later king of Assyria, while Shamash-shum-ukin remained crown prince of Babylonia. Provincial governors and vassals had to take an oath to accept
2 CONC  this and to help the brothers gain their respective thrones in the event of Esarhaddon's death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Esarhaddon unexpectedly died on a campaign against rebellious Egypt in 669, it was only the decisive action of Naqi'a-Zakutu, widow of Sennacherib, that got Assurbanipal on the throne, in the 
2 CONC face of opposition by court officials and parts of the priesthood. Shamash-shum-ukin, the older brother, became viceroy of Babylonia. The arrangement was evidently intended to flatter the Babylonians 
2 CONC by giving them once more the semblance of independence. But it failed to work, as Shamash-shum-ukin became more Babylonian than his subjects, and claimed to be the successor of the monarchs whose empi
2 CONC re had once stretched to the Mediterranean.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Babylonian territory consisted of Babylon, Borsippa, Kutha and Sippar. While Shamash-shum-ukin was sovereign ruler of the south in theory, Assyria maintained a garrison in Nippur, and some of t
2 CONC he provincial governors tried to get into Assyrian favour. Letters by Sin-balassu-iqbi, governor of Ur show how he tried to ingratiate himself with Assurbanipal.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Assurbanipal took an active part in the restoration of sanctuaries in the south. A stela now in London commemorates his help in restoring E-sagila (the tower of Babel), another tells of how he rest
2 CONC ored the Nabu-temple in Borsippa. Even the Sumerian language was revived as the official tongue.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In May 652, Shamash-shum-ukin rose in rebellion. The reasons for this are completely unknown, as no Babylonian sources have been preserved. He was joined by Nabu-bel-shumate, king of the sea-countr
2 CONC y, the Elamites, the Chaldean tribes of the South, the kings of Guti, Amurru and Melukka and tribes from the Arab desert. After two years Babylon and Borsippa were besieged, and Elam was beaten. Babyl
2 CONC on yielded in June 648 because of starvation. The sources describe cases of cannibalism. Shamash-shum-ukin threw himself into his burning palace, to be remembered by the Greeks in the story of Sardana
2 CONC pal. His successor on the throne of Babylon was Kandalanu (647-627). Kandalanu, however, may have been a throne name taken by Assurbanipal himself.

2 CONT <p>Median Empire</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Median Empire, was the first Iranian dynasty corresponding to the northeastern section of present-day Iran, Northern-Khvarvarana and Asuristan (now days known as Iraq), and South and Eastern An
2 CONC atolia. The inhabitants, who were known as Medes, and their neighbors, the Persians, spoke Median languages that were closely related to Aryan (Old Persian). Historians know very little about the Iran
2 CONC ian culture under the Median dynasty, except that Zoroastrianism as well as a polytheistic religion was practiced, and a priestly caste called the Magi existed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Traditionally, the creator of the Median kingdom was one Deioces, who, according to Herodotus, reigned from 728 to 675 BCE and founded the Median capital Ecbatana (Hâgmatâna or modern Hamadan). A
2 CONC ttempts have been made to associate Daiaukku, a local Zagros king mentioned in a cuneiform text as one of the captives deported to Assyria by Sargon II in 714 BCE, with the Deioces of Herodotus, but s
2 CONC uch an association is highly unlikely. To judge from the Assyrian sources, no Median kingdom such as Herodotus describes for the reign of Deioces existed in the early 7th century BCE; at best, he is r
2 CONC eporting a Median legend of the founding of their kingdom.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Herodotus (History of Herodotus), Deioces was succeeded by his son Phraortes (675-653 BCE), who subjugated the Persians and lost his life in a premature attack against the Assyrians. S
2 CONC ome of this tale may be true. Assyrian texts speak of a Kashtariti as the leader of a conglomerate group of Medes, Scythians, Mannaeans, and miscellaneous other local Zagros peoples that seriously thr
2 CONC eatened the peace of Assyria's eastern borderlands during the reign of Esarhaddon (680-669 BCE). It is possible that Phraortes is this Kashtariti, though the suggestion cannot be proved either histori
2 CONC cally or linguistically. That a Median king in this period exerted political and military control over the Persians is entirely reasonable, though it cannot be proved.

2 CONT <p>The lion of Ecabtana, Hephaestion's tomb</p>
2 CONT <p>Beginning as early as the 9th century, and with increasing impact in the late 8th and early 7th centuries, groups of nomadic warriors entered western Iran, probably from across the Caucasus. Domina
2 CONC nt among these groups were the Scythians, and their entrance into the affairs of the western plateau during the 7th century may perhaps mark one of the important turning points in Iron Age history. He
2 CONC rodotus speaks in some detail of a period of Scythian domination, the so-called Scythian interregnum in Median dynasty history. His dating of this event remains uncertain, but traditionally it is seen
2 CONC  as falling between the reigns of Phraortes and Cyaxares and as covering the years 653 to 625 BCE. Whether such an interregnum ever actually occurred and, if it did, whether it should not be dated lat
2 CONC er than this are open questions. What is clear is that, by the mid-7th century BCE, there were a great many Scythians in western Iran, that they, along with the Medes and other groups, posed a serious
2 CONC  threat to Assyria, and that their appearance threw previous power alignments quite out of balance.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Herodotus reports how, under Cyaxares of Media (625-585 BCE), the Scythians were overthrown when their kings were induced at a supper party to get so drunk that they were then easily slain. It is m
2 CONC ore likely that about this time either the Scythians withdrew voluntarily from western Iran and went off to plunder elsewhere or they were simply absorbed into a rapidly developing confederation under
2 CONC  Median hegemony. Cyaxares is a fully historical figure who appears in the cuneiform sources as Uvakhshatra. Herodotus speaks of how Cyaxares reorganized the Median army into units built around specia
2 CONC lized armaments: spearmen, bowmen, and cavalry. The unified and reorganized Medes were a match for the Assyrians. They attacked one of the important Assyrian border cities, Arrapkha, in 615 BCE, surro
2 CONC unded Nineveh in 614 BCE but were unable to capture it, and instead successfully stormed the Assyrian religious capital, Ashur. An alliance between Babylon and the Medes was sealed by the betrothal of
2 CONC  Cyaxares' granddaughter to Nabopolassar's son, Nebuchadrezzar II (605-562 BCE). In 612 BCE the attack on Nineveh was renewed, and the city fell in late August (the Babylonians arrived rather too late
2 CONC  to participate fully in the battle). The Babylonians and the Medes together pursued the fleeing Assyrians westward into Syria. Assyrian appeals to Egypt for help came to nought, and the last Assyrian
2 CONC  ruler, Ashur-uballit II, disappeared from history in 609 BCE.

2 CONT <p>The problem, of course, was how to divide the spoils among the victors. The cuneiform sources are comparatively silent, but it would seem that the Babylonians fell heir to all of the Assyrian holdi
2 CONC ngs within the fertile crescent, while their allies took over all of the highland areas. The Medes gained control over the lands in eastern Anatolia that had once been part of Urartu and eventually be
2 CONC came embroiled in war with the Lydians, the dominant political power in western Asia Minor. In 585 BCE, probably through the mediation of the Babylonians, peace was established between Media and Lydia
2 CONC , and the Halys (Kizil) River was fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms. Thus a new balance of power was established in the Middle East among Medes, Lydians, Babylonians, and, far to the sout
2 CONC h, Egyptians. At his death, Cyaxares controlled vast territories: all of Anatolia to the Halys, the whole of western Iran eastward, perhaps as far as the area of modern Tehran, and all of south-wester
2 CONC n Iran, including Fars. Whether it is appropriate to call these holdings a kingdom is debatable; one suspects that authority over the various peoples, Iranian and non-Iranian, who occupied these terri
2 CONC tories was exerted in the form of a confederation such as is implied by the ancient Iranian royal title, king of kings.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Astyages followed his father, Cyaxares, on the Median throne (585-550 BCE). Comparatively little is known of his reign. All was not well with the alliance with Babylon, and there is some evidence t
2 CONC o suggest that Babylonia may have feared Median power. The latter, however, was soon in no position to threaten others, for Astyages was himself under attack. Indeed, Astyages and the Medians were soo
2 CONC n overthrown by the rise to power in the Iranian world of Cyrus II the Great.

2 CONT <p>[edit] Rise to power Victory stele.When, despite being the youngest son, he was named successor by his father, his elder brothers tried to discredit him. Oracles had named Esarhaddon as the person 
2 CONC to free the exiles and rebuild Babylon, the destruction of which by Sennacherib was felt to be sacrilegious. Esarhaddon remained crown prince, but was forced into exile at an unknown place beyond Hani
2 CONC lgalbat (Mitanni), that is, beyond the Euphrates, most likely somewhere in what is now southeastern Turkey.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib was murdered in 681 BC, some[who?] claim at the instigation of Esarhaddon, though this seems hardly likely, as he was not in a situation to exploit unrest arising from the death of his 
2 CONC father. The biblical account is that his brothers killed their father after the failed attempt to capture Jerusalem and fled to the land of Ararat (2 Kings 19:37). He returned to the capital of Nineve
2 CONC h in forced marches and defeated his rival brothers in six weeks of civil war. He was formally declared king in spring of 681 BC. His brothers fled the land, and their followers and families were put 
2 CONC to death. In the same year he began the rebuilding of Babylon, including the well-known Esagila and the Ekur at Nippur (structures sometimes identified with Tower of Babel).[3] The statues of the Baby
2 CONC lonian gods were restored and returned to the city. In order not to appear too biased in favor of Babylonia, he ordered the reconstruction of the Assyrian sanctuary of Esharra in Ashur as well. Foreig
2 CONC ners were forbidden to enter this temple. Both buildings were dedicated almost at the same date, in year two of his reign.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Military campaignsThe first military campaigns of Esarhaddon were directed against nomadic tribes of southern Mesopotamia, the Dakkuri and Gambulu, who had been harassing the peasants. In 67
2 CONC 9 BC the Cimmerians, who had already killed his grandfather Sargon II, reappeared in Cilicia and Tabal under their new ruler Teushpa. Esarhaddon defeated them near Hubushna, and defeated the rebelliou
2 CONC s inhabitants of Hilakku as well. The Cimmerians withdrew to the west, where, with Scythian and Urartuan help, they were to destroy the kingdom of Phrygia in 676 BC .

2 CONT <p>The Sidonian king Abdi-Milkutti, who had risen up against the Assyrian king, was defeated in 677 BC and beheaded. The town of Sidon was destroyed and rebuilt as Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina, the "Harbor of

2 CONT <p>In 676 BC Esarhaddon took the towns of Sissu and Kundu in the Taurus Mountains. The Mannaeans, the Scythians under their king Ishpakaia, and the "Gutians" of the Zagros proved to be a nuisance as w

2 CONC  the horse trade between Parsuash and Assyria and refused to pay further tribute. After the fall of Phrygia, a daughter of Esarhaddon was wedded to the Scythian prince Partatua of Sakasene in order to
2 CONC  improve relations with the nomads. The Medes under Khshathrita (Phraortes) had been the target of a campaign as well, the date of which is unclear (possibly before 676 BC). Later, Assyrian hosts reac

2 CONT <p>In 672 BC, crown prince Sin-iddina-apla died. He had been the oldest son and designated as king of Assyria, while the second son Shamash-shum-ukin was to become the ruler of Babylon. Now, the young
2 CONC er Ashurbanipal became crown prince, but he was very unpopular with the court and the priesthood. Contracts were made with leading Assyrians, members of the royal family and foreign rulers, to assure 
2 CONC their loyalty to the crown prince.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 671 BC Esarhaddon went to war against Pharaoh Taharqa of Egypt. Part of his army stayed behind to deal with rebellions in Tyre, and perhaps Ashkelon. The remainder went south to Rapihu, then cro
2 CONC ssed the Sinai, a desert inhabited by dreadful and dangerous animals, and entered Egypt. In the summer he took Memphis, and Taharqa fled to Upper Egypt. Esarhaddon now called himself "king of Egypt, P
2 CONC atros and Kush", and returned with rich booty from the cities of the delta; he erected a victory stele at this time, showing the son of Taharqa in bondage, Prince Ushankhuru. Almost as soon as the kin
2 CONC g left, Egypt rebelled against Assyrian rule.

2 CONT <p>[edit] DeathEsarhaddon had to contend with court intrigues at Nineveh that led to the execution of several nobles, and sent his general, Sha-Nabu-shu, to restore order in the Nile Valley. In 669 BC
2 CONC , he went to Egypt in person, but suddenly died in autumn of the same year, in Harran. He was succeeded by Ashurbanipal as king of Assyria and Shamash-shum-ukin as king of Babylonia.

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Esarhaddon (Greek and Biblical form; Akkadian Aššur-aha-iddina "Ashur has given a brother to me"), was a king of Assyria who reigned 681 BC-669 BC), the youngest son of Sennacherib and the Aramai
2 CONC c queen Naqi'a (Zakitu), Sennacherib's second wife. When, despite being the youngest son, he was named successor by his father, his elder brothers tried to discredit him. Oracles had named Esarhaddon 
2 CONC as the person to free the exiles and rebuild Babylon, the destruction of which by Sennacherib was felt to be sacrilegious. Esarhaddon remained crown prince, but was forced into exile at an unknown pla
2 CONC ce beyond Hanilgalbat (Mitanni), that is, beyond the Euphrates, most likely somewhere in what is now southeastern Turkey.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib was murdered in 681 BC, some claim at the instigation of Esarhaddon, though this seems hardly likely, as he was not in a situation to exploit unrest arising from the death of his father
2 CONC . He returned to the capital of Nineveh in forced marches and defeated his rival brothers in six weeks of civil war. He was formally declared king in spring of 681 BC. His brothers fled the land, and 
2 CONC their followers and families were put to death. In the same year he began the rebuilding of Babylon, including the well-known Esagila (sometimes identified with Tower of Babel). The statues of the Bab
2 CONC ylonian gods were restored and returned to the city. In order not to appear too biased in favor of Babylonia, he ordered the reconstruction of the Assyrian sanctuary of Esharra in Ashur as well. Forei
2 CONC gners were forbidden to enter this temple. Both buildings were dedicated almost at the same date, in year two of his reign.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The first military campaigns of Esarhaddon were directed against nomadic tribes of southern Mesopotamia, the Dakkuri and Gambulu, who had been harassing the peasants. In 679 BC the Cimmerians, who 
2 CONC had already killed his grandfather Sargon, reappeared in Cilicia and Tabal under their new ruler Teushpa. Esarhaddon defeated them near Hubushna, and defeated the rebellious inhabitants of Hilakku as 
2 CONC well. The Cimmerians withdrew to the west, where they were to destroy the kingdom of Phrygia in 676, together with Scythian and Urartian help.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Sidonian king Abdi-Milkutti, who had risen up against the Assyrian king, was defeated in 677 BC and beheaded. The town of Sidon was destroyed and rebuilt as Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina, the Harbor of 
2 CONC Esarhaddon. The population was deported to Assyria. A share of the plunder went to the loyal king of rival Tyre. The partly conserved text of a treaty with Tyre mentions the kings of Judah, Edom, Moab
2 CONC , Gaza, Ashkelon, Ekron, Byblos, Arvad, Samsi-muruna, Ammon, Ashdod, ten kings from the coast of the sea, and ten kings from the middle of the sea (usually identified with Cyprus), as Assyrian allies.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 676 BC Esarhaddon took the towns of Sissu and Kundu in the Taurus mountains. The Mannaeans, the Scythians under their king Ishpakaia, and the Guti of the Zagros proved to be a nuisance as well, 
2 CONC as is attested by numerous oracle-texts. The Mannaeans, former vassals of the Assyrians, were no longer restricted to the area around Lake Urmia, but had spread into Zamua, where they interrupted the 
2 CONC horse trade between Parsuash and Assyria and refused to pay further tribute. After the fall of Phrygia, a daughter of Esarhaddon was wedded to the Scythian prince Partatua of Sakasene in order to impr
2 CONC ove relations with the nomads. The Medes under [Khshathrita (Phraortes) had been the target of a campaign as well, the date of which is unclear (possibly before 676 BC). Later, Assyrian hosts reached 
2 CONC the border of the "salt-desert" near the mountain Bikni, that is, near Teheran. A number of fortresses secured the Zagros: Bit-Parnakki, Bit-kari and Harhar (Kar-Sharrukin).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A certain Mugallu had taken possession of parts of Meliddu (Melitene), and associated himself with the king of Tabal. Meliddu was besieged in 675 BC, but without success. That same year, Humban-Hal
2 CONC tash II of Elam began a campaign against Sippar, but was defeated by the Babylonians, and died soon afterwards. His brother and successor Urtaki restored peace with Assyria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A preliminary campaign against Egypt begun by Esarhaddon the next year seems to have failed. Meanwhile, Esarhaddon was waging war in the land of Bazu, situated opposite of the island of Dilmun (Bah
2 CONC rain), probably Qatar, "where snakes and scorpions cover the ground like ants" - a dry land of salt deserts. In 673 BC, Esarhaddon waged war against Urartu under king Rusas II, that had strengthened a
2 CONC gain after the ravages of Sargon and the Cimmerians.

2 CONT <p>In 672 BC, crown prince Sin-iddina-apla died. He had been the oldest son and designated as king of Assyria, while the second son Shamash-shum-ukin was to become the ruler of Babylon. Now, the young
2 CONC er Assurbanipal became crown prince, but he was very unpopular with the court and the priesthood. Contracts were made with leading Assyrians, members of the royal family and foreign rulers, to assure

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Assyrians ruled Upper Asia[110] for five hundred and twenty years,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>and from them the Medes were the first who made revolt. These having</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>fought for their freedom with the Assyrians proved themselves good</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>men, and thus they pushed off the yoke of slavery from themselves and</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>were set free; and after them the other nations also did the same as</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>the Medes: and when all on the continent were thus independent, they</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>returned again to despotic rule as follows:--96. There appeared among</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>the Medes a man of great ability whose name was Deïokes, and this man</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>was the son of Phraortes. This Deïokes, having formed a desire for</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>despotic power, did thus:--whereas the Medes dwelt in separate</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>villages, he, being even before that time of great repute in his own</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>village, set himself to practise just dealing much more and with</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>greater zeal than before; and this he did although there was much</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>lawlessness throughout the whole of Media, and although he knew that</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>injustice is ever at feud with justice. And the Medes of the same</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>village, seeing his manners, chose him for their judge. So he, since</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>he was aiming at power, was upright and just, and doing thus he had no</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>little praise from his fellow-citizens, insomuch that those of the</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>other villages learning that Deïokes was a man who more than all</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>others gave decision rightly, whereas before this they had been wont</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>to suffer from unjust judgments, themselves also when they heard it</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>came gladly to Deïokes to have their causes determined, and at last</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>they trusted the business to no one else. 97. Then, as more and more</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>continually kept coming to him, because men learnt that his decisions</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>proved to be according to the truth, Deïokes perceiving that</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>everything was referred to himself would no longer sit in the place</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>where he used formerly to sit in public to determine causes, and said</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>that he would determine causes no more, for it was not profitable for</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>him to neglect his own affairs and to determine causes for his</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>neighbours all through the day. So then, since robbery and lawlessness</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>prevailed even much more in the villages than they did before, the</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Medes having assembled together in one place considered with one</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>another and spoke about the state in which they were: and I suppose</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>the friends of Deïokes spoke much to this effect: "Seeing that we are</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>not able to dwell in the land under the present order of things, let</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>us set up a king from among ourselves, and thus the land will be well</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>governed and we ourselves shall turn to labour, and shall not be</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ruined by lawlessness." By some such words as these they persuaded</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>themselves to have a king. 98. And when they straightway proposed the</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>question whom they should set up to be king, Deïokes was much put</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>forward and commended by every one, until at last they agreed that he</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>should be their king. And he bade them build for him a palace worthy</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>of the royal dignity and strengthen him with a guard of spearmen. And</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>the Medes did so: for they built him a large and strong palace in that</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>part of the land which he told them, and they allowed him to select</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>spearmen from all the Medes. And when he had obtained the rule over</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>them, he compelled the Medes to make one fortified city and pay chief</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>attention to this, having less regard to the other cities. And as the</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Medes obeyed him in this also, he built large and strong walls, those</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>which are now called Agbatana, standing in circles one within the</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>other. And this wall is so contrived that one circle is higher than</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>the next by the height of the battlements alone. And to some extent, I</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>suppose, the nature of the ground, seeing that it is on a hill,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>assists towards this end; but much more was it produced by art, since</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>the circles are in all seven in number.[111] And within the last</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>circle are the royal palace and the treasure-houses. The largest of</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>these walls is in size about equal to the circuit of the wall round</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athens; and of the first circle the battlements are white, of the</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>second black, of the third crimson, of the fourth blue, of the fifth</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>red: thus are the battlements of all the circles coloured with various</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>tints, and the two last have their battlements one of them overlaid</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>with silver and the other with gold. 99. These walls then Deïokes</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>built for himself and round his own palace, and the people he</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>commanded to dwell round about the wall. And after all was built,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Deïokes established the rule, which he was the first to establish,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>ordaining that none should enter into the presence of the king, but</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>that they deal with him always through messengers; and that the king</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>should be seen by no one; and moreover that to laugh or to spit in</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>presence is unseemly, and this last for every one without</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>exception.[112] Now he surrounded himself with this state[113] to the</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>end that his fellows, who had been brought up with him and were of no</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>meaner family nor behind him in manly virtue, might not be grieved by</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>seeing him and make plots against him, but that being unseen by them</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>he might be thought to be of different mould. 100. Having set these</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>things in order and strengthened himself in his despotism, he was</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>severe in preserving justice; and the people used to write down their</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>causes and send them in to his presence, and he determined the</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>questions which were brought in to him and sent them out again. Thus</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>he used to do about the judgment of causes; and he also took order for</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>this, that is to say, if he heard that any one was behaving in an</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>unruly manner, he sent for him and punished him according as each act</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>of wrong deserved, and he had watchers and listeners about all the</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>land over which he ruled.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>101. Deïokes then united the Median race alone, and was ruler of this:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>and of the Medes there are the tribes which here follow, namely,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Busai, Paretakenians, Struchates, Arizantians, Budians, Magians: the</p>
2 CONT <p></p>

2 CONT <p>[edit] Rise to powerAs the crown prince, Sennacherib was placed in charge of the Assyrian Empire while his father, Sargon II, was on campaign. Unlike his predecessors, Sennacherib's reign was not l
2 CONC argely marked by military campaigns, but mainly by architectural renovations, constructions, and expansions. After the violent death of his father, Sennacherib encountered numerous problems in establi
2 CONC shing his power and faced threats to his domain. However, he was able to overcome these power struggles and ultimately carry out his building projects. During his reign, he moved the empire's capital 
2 CONC from his father's newly-constructed city of Dur-Sharrukin to the old city and former capital of Nineveh. It is considered striking that Sennacherib not only left his father's city, but also doesn’t 
2 CONC name him in any official inscription during his reign.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] War with Babylon  Assyrian warriors armed with slings from the palace of Sennacherib, 7th century BCEDuring his reign Sennacherib encountered various problems with Babylonia. His first campa
2 CONC ign took place in 703 BC against Marduk-apla-iddina II who had seized the throne of Babylon and gathered an alliance supported by Chaldeans, Aramaeans, and Elamites. We can date the visit of Babylonia
2 CONC n ambassadors to Hezekiah of Judah in this period. The allies wanted to make use of the unrest that arose at the accession of Sennacherib. Sennacherib split his army and had one part attack the statio
2 CONC ned enemy at Kish while he and the rest of the army proceeded to capture the city Cutha. After that was done the king returned swiftly to aid the rest of his army. The rebellion was defeated and Mardu
2 CONC k-apla-iddina II fled. Babylon was taken, and its palace plundered but its citizens were left unharmed. The Assyrians searched for Marduk-apla-iddina II, especially in the southern marshes, but he was
2 CONC  not found. The rebellion forces in the Babylonian cities were wiped out and a Babylonian named Bel-ibni who was raised at the Assyrian court was placed on the throne. When the Assyrians left, Marduk-
2 CONC apla-iddina II started to prepare another rebellion. In 700 BC the Assyrian army returned to fight the rebels in the marshes again. Not surprisingly, Marduk-apla-iddina II fled again to Elam and died 
2 CONC there.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Bel-Ibni proved to be disloyal to Assyria and was taken back a prisoner. Sennacherib tried to solve the problem of the Babylonian rebellion by placing someone loyal to him on the throne, namely his
2 CONC  son Ashur-nadin-shumi. It didn’t help. Another campaign was led six years later, in 694 BC, to destroy the Elamite base on the shore of the Persian Gulf. To accomplish this, Sennacherib had obtaine
2 CONC d Phoenician and Syrian boats which sailed with the rest of his army down the Tigris to the sea. The Phoenicians were not used to the tide of the Persian Gulf which caused a delay. The Assyrians battl
2 CONC ed the Chaldeans at the river Ulaya and won the day. While the Assyrians were busy at the Persian Gulf, the Elamites invaded northern Babylonia in a complete surprise. Sennacherib's son was captured a
2 CONC nd taken to Elam and his throne was taken over by Nergal-ushezib. The Assyrians fought their way back north and captured various cities, in the meanwhile a year had passed as it was now 693 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A large battle was fought against the Babylonian rebels at Nippur, their king was captured and in turn taken to Nineveh. For the loss of his son Sennacherib launched another campaign into Elam wher
2 CONC e his army started to plunder cities. The Elamite king fled to the mountains and Sennacherib was forced to return home because of the coming winter. Another rebellion leader, named Mushezib-Marduk cla
2 CONC imed the Babylonian throne and was supported by Elam. The last great battle was fought in 691 BC with an uncertain result which enabled Mushezib-Marduk to remain on the throne for another two years. T
2 CONC his was only a brief respite because shortly afterwards Babylon was besieged which led to its fall in 689 BC. Sennacherib claimed to have destroyed the city and indeed the city was unoccupied for seve
2 CONC ral years.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] War with Judah[edit] BackgroundIn 701 BC, a rebellion backed by Egypt and Babylonia broke out in Judah, led by King Hezekiah. In response Sennacherib sacked a number of cities in Judah. He l
2 CONC aid siege to Jerusalem, but soon returned to Nineveh, with Jerusalem not having been sacked, in order to put down an attempted coup. This event was recorded by Sennacherib himself, by Herodotus, Josep
2 CONC hus, and by several Biblical writers. According to the Bible, Sennacherib also withdrew because the "angel of Yahweh went out and put to death a 185,000 in the Assyrian camp" (2 Kings 19:35).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Sennacherib's account  Assyrian siege ramp at Lachish.Some of the Assyrian chronicles, such as the baked-clay Taylor prism now preserved in the British Museum, and the similar Sennacherib pr
2 CONC ism, preserved in the Oriental Institute, Chicago, date from very close to the time. (see also: Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire)[1] (The Taylor Prism itself bears the date "the month of Ta
2 CONC mmuz; eponym of Galihu, governor of Hatarikka" which is Tammuz in the year 689 BC, according to the Assyrian Eponym List). Assyrian accounts do not treat it as a disaster, but a great victory — they
2 CONC  maintain that the siege was so successful that Hezekiah was forced to give a monetary tribute, and the Assyrians left victoriously, without losses of thousands of men, and without sacking Jerusalem. 
2 CONC Part of this is contained in the Biblical account, but it is still debated fiercely by historians. In the Taylor Prism, Sennacherib states that he had shut up Hezekiah the Judahite within Jerusalem, h
2 CONC is own royal city, like a caged bird.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib first recounts several of his previous victories, and how his enemies had become overwhelmed by his presence. He was able to do this to Great Sidon, Little Sidon, Bit-Zitti, Zaribtu, Ma
2 CONC halliba, Ushu, Akzib and Akko. After taking each of these cities, Sennacherib installed a puppet leader named Ethbaal as ruler over the entire region. Sennacherib then turned his attention to Beth-Dag
2 CONC on, Joppa, Banai-Barqa, and Azjuru, cities that were ruled by Sidqia and also fell to Sennacherib.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Egypt and Nubia then came to the aid of the stricken cities. Sennacherib defeated the Egyptians and, by his own account, single-handedly captured the Egyptian and Nubian charioteers. Sennacherib ca
2 CONC ptured and sacked several other cities, including Lachish (the second most-strongly fortified city in the Kingdom of Judah). He punished the "criminal" citizens of the cities, and he reinstalled Padi,

2 CONT <p>After this, Sennacherib turned to King Hezekiah of Judah, who refused to submit to him. Forty-six of Hezekiah's cities (cities in 1st millennium BC terms ranged in size from large modern-day towns 
2 CONC to villages) were conquered by Sennacherib, but Jerusalem did not fall. His own account of this invasion, as given in the Taylor prism, is as follows:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>“ Because Hezekiah, king of Judah, would not submit to my yoke, I came up against him, and by force of arms and by the might of my power I took 46 of his strong fenced cities; and of the smaller 
2 CONC towns which were scattered about, I took and plundered a countless number. From these places I took and carried off 200,156 persons, old and young, male and female, together with horses and mules, ass
2 CONC es and camels, oxen and sheep, a countless multitude; and Hezekiah himself I shut up in Jerusalem, his capital city, like a bird in a cage, building towers round the city to hem him in, and raising ba
2 CONC nks of earth against the gates, so as to prevent escape... Then upon Hezekiah there fell the fear of the power of my arms, and he sent out to me the chiefs and the elders of Jerusalem with 30 talents 
2 CONC of gold and 800 talents of silver, and diverse treasures, a rich and immense booty... All these things were brought to me at Nineveh, the seat of my government. ”
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Biblical accountThe Biblical account of Sennacherib's siege of Jerusalem begins with the destruction of the Northern Kingdom of Israel and its capital Samaria. According to the Hebrew Bible,
2 CONC  the ten northern tribes came to be known as the Ten Lost Tribes, because as recorded in II Kings 17, they were carried off and settled with other peoples as was the Assyrian policy. II Kings 18-19 (a
2 CONC nd parallel passage II Chronicles 32:1-23) details Sennacherib's attack on Judah and capital Jerusalem. Hezekiah had rebelled against the Assyrians, so they had captured all of the towns in Judah. Hez
2 CONC ekiah realized his error and sent great tribute to Sennacherib. But the Assyrians nevertheless marched toward Jerusalem. Sennacherib sent his supreme commander with an army to besiege Jerusalem while 
2 CONC he himself went to fight with the Egyptians. The supreme commander met with Hezekiah's officials and threatened them to surrender; while hailing insults so the people of the city could hear, blasphemi
2 CONC ng Judah and particularly Jehovah. When the King Hezekiah heard of this, he tore his clothes (as was the custom of the day for displaying deep anguish) and prayed to Jehovah in the Temple. Isaiah the 
2 CONC prophet told the king that Jehovah would take care of the whole matter and that he would return to his own lands. That night, the Angel of Jehovah killed 185,000 Assyrian troops. Jewish tradition main
2 CONC tains that the angel Gabriel (along with Michael in the Targum's version) was the angel sent to destroy the Assyrian troops, and that the destruction occurred on Passover night.[2][3][4] Sennacherib s
2 CONC oon returned to Nineveh in disgrace. Some years later, while Sennacherib was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, two of his sons killed him and fled to Armenia. Some[who?] suggest that Psalm 
2 CONC 46 was composed as a Song of Deliverance that was led by the Korahite Levitical singers and accompanied by the Alamoth (maidens with tambourines) and sung by the inhabitants of Jerusalem after their s
2 CONC uccessful defense of the city from the siege.

2 CONT <p>[edit] Disaster in Egypt according to HerodotusThe Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote his Histories ca. 450 BC, speaks of a divinely-appointed disaster destroying an army of Sennacherib (2:141):
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>“ when Sanacharib, king of the Arabians and Assyrians, marched his vast army into Egypt, the warriors one and all refused to come to his (i.e., the Pharaoh Sethos) aid. On this the monarch, great
2 CONC ly distressed, entered into the inner sanctuary, and, before the image of the god, bewailed the fate which impended over him. As he wept he fell asleep, and dreamed that the god came and stood at his 
2 CONC side, bidding him be of good cheer, and go boldly forth to meet the Arabian host, which would do him no hurt, as he himself would send those who should help him. Sethos, then, relying on the dream, co
2 CONC llected such of the Egyptians as were willing to follow him, who were none of them warriors, but traders, artisans, and market people; and with these marched to Pelusium, which commands the entrance i
2 CONC nto Egypt, and there pitched his camp. As the two armies lay here opposite one another, there came in the night, a multitude of field-mice, which devoured all the quivers and bowstrings of the enemy, 
2 CONC and ate the thongs by which they managed their shields. Next morning they commenced their fight, and great multitudes fell, as they had no arms with which to defend themselves. There stands to this da
2 CONC y in the temple of Vulcan, a stone statue of Sethos, with a mouse in his hand, and an inscription to this effect - 'Look on me, and learn to reverence the gods.' ”
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to F. Ll. Griffith, an attractive hypothesis is to identify the Pharaoh as Taharqa before his succession, and Sethos as his Memphitic priestly title, "supposing that he was then governor 
2 CONC of Lower Egypt and high-priest of Ptah, and that in his office of governor he prepared to move on the defensive against a threatened attack by Sennacherib. While Taharqa was still in the neighbourhood
2 CONC  of Pelusium, some unexpected disaster may have befallen the Assyrian host on the borders of Kingdom of Judah and arrested their march on Egypt." (Stories of the High Priests of Memphis: The Sethon of
2 CONC  Herodotus and the Demotic Tales of Khamuas (1900), p. 11.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] As recorded by JosephusJosephus' Jewish Antiquities, book ten, verses 21-23 relate an account by the Babylonian historian Berossus, in which Berosus claims a disease befell an Assyrian army 
2 CONC led by Rabshakeh, and one-hundred and eighty thousand men were lost. Earlier in the book, the account of Herodotus is also mentioned. [5]

2 CONT <p>[edit] Building projects  View of ancient Nineveh, Description de L'Univers (Alain Manesson Mallet, 1719).During Sennacherib's reign, Nineveh evolved into the leading Metropolis of the empire. His 
2 CONC building projects started almost as soon as he became king. Already in 703 BC he had built a palace complete with park and artificial irrigation he called his new home ‘The palace without rival’. 
2 CONC For this ambitious project an old palace was torn down to make more room. In addition to his own large gardens, several small gardens were made for the citizens of Nineveh. He also constructed the fir
2 CONC st ever aqueduct, at Jerwan in 690 BCE,[6] which supplied the large demand of water in Nineveh. The narrow alleys and squares of Nineveh were cleaned up and enlarged, and a royal road and avenue were 
2 CONC constructed, which crossed a bridge on its approach to the park gate and which was lined on both sides with stelae. Temples were restored and built during his reign, as is the duty of the king. Most n
2 CONC otable is his work on the Assur (god) and the new year (Akitu) temples. He also expanded the city defences which included a moat surrounding the city walls. Some of his city walls have been restored a
2 CONC nd can still be seen nowadays. The labour for his giant building project was performed by people of Que, Cilicia, Philistia, Tyre, and Chaldeans, Aramaeans, and Mannaeans who were there involuntarily.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib has been credited with the invention of the Archimedes screw for the purpose of irrigation, although evidence for this is contentious.[7]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] PatricideSennacherib was killed by two of his sons for his desecration of Babylon.[8][9] One story tells of one of Sennacherib's sons toppling a giant lamassu onto him, crushing him to death
2 CONC . He was ultimately succeeded by another son, Esarhaddon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] In popular cultureAn 1813 poem by Lord Byron, The Destruction of Sennacherib, commemorates Sennacherib's campaign in Judea from the Hebrew point of view. Written in anapestic tetrameter, the
2 CONC  poem was popular in school recitations.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib is briefly mentioned in the science-fiction novel Children of Dune by Frank Herbert, and in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib is also mentioned in the science-fiction novel The War of the Worlds by author H. G. Wells. Chapter 8: "I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that God had re
2 CONC pented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night."

2 CONT <p>Sennacherib</p>
2 CONT <p>This entry incorporates text from Easton's Bible Dictionary, 1897, with some modernisation.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib (In Akkadian Sin-ehhe-erib, "Sin (the moon god) has taken the place of brothers to me") was the son of Sargon II, whom he succeeded on the throne of Assyria in (705–681 BC). His reign
2 CONC  was tested several times by revolts – each of which was brought down.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 701 BC, an Egyptian-backed rebellion broke out in Judah and was led by Hezekiah. Sennacherib was able to sack many cites in Judah; however, he was not able to take its capital, Jerusalem. This f
2 CONC amous event was recorded by Sennacherib himself, by Herodotus, and by several biblical writers.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"And the Lord sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria" (2 Chronicles 32:21). There is no mention of this great dis
2 CONC aster in the Assyrian annals.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib's account</p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib first recounts several of his previous victories, and how his enemies had become overwhelmed by his presence. He was able to do this to Great Sidon, Little Sidon, Bit-Zitti, Zaribtu, Ma
2 CONC halliba, Ushu, Akzib and Akko. After taking each of these cities, Sennacherib installed a puppet leader named Ethbaal as ruler over the entire region. Sennacherib then turned his attention to Beth-Dag
2 CONC on, Joppa, Banai-Barqa, and Azjuru, cities that were ruled by Sidqia and also fell to Sennacherib.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Egypt and Nubia then came to the aid of the stricken cities. Sennacherib defeated the Egyptians and, by his own account, single-handedly captured the Egyptian and Nubian charioteers. Sennacherib ca
2 CONC ptured and sacked several other cities, including Lachish. He punished the "criminal" citizens of the cities, and he reinstalled Padi their leader, who had been held as a hostage in Jerusalem.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After this, Sennacherib turned to King Hezekiah of Judah, who stubbornly refused to submit to him. Forty-six of Hezekiah's cities were conquered by Sennacherib, but Jerusalem did not fall. His own 
2 CONC account of this invasion, as given in the Assyrian annals, is as follows:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Because Hezekiah, king of Judah, would not submit to my yoke, I came up against him, and by force of arms and by the might of my power I took 46 of his strong fenced cities; and of the smaller town
2 CONC s which were scattered about, I took and plundered a countless number. From these places I took and carried off 200,156 persons, old and young, male and female, together with horses and mules, asses a
2 CONC nd camels, oxen and sheep, a countless multitude; and Hezekiah himself I shut up in Jerusalem, his capital city, like a bird in a cage, building towers round the city to hem him in, and raising banks 
2 CONC of earth against the gates, so as to prevent escape... Then upon Hezekiah there fell the fear of the power of my arms, and he sent out to me the chiefs and the elders of Jerusalem with 30 talents of g
2 CONC old and 800 talents of silver, and divers treasures, a rich and immense booty... All these things were brought to me at Nineveh, the seat of my government.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Isaiah's account</p>
2 CONT <p>Isaiah's account of Sennacherib's siege of Jerusalem is rather long. It starts with the obvious, about Sennacherib's march against the cities of Judah, and simply states that Sennacherib takes them
2 CONC . Isaiah then recounts how Hezekiah prayed to the God of Israel to save Jerusalem. His account then ended in the way the God of Israel defeats Sennacherib's army: many of Sennacherib's troops are simp
2 CONC ly killed in their sleep.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The disaster according to Herodotus</p>
2 CONT <p>The Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote his Histories ca. 440 BC, also speaks of a Divinely-appointed disaster destroying an army of Sennacherib in this same campaign (2:141):
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>when Sanacharib, king of the Arabians and Assyrians, marched his vast army into Egypt, the warriors one and all refused to come to his [ie., the Pharoah Sethos'] aid. On this the monarch, greatly d
2 CONC istressed, entered into the inner sanctuary, and, before the image of the god, bewailed the fate which impended over him. As he wept he fell asleep, and dreamed that the god came and stood at his side
2 CONC , bidding him be of good cheer, and go boldly forth to meet the Arabian host, which would do him no hurt, as he himself would send those who should help him. Sethos, then, relying on the dream, collec

2 CONC Egypt, and there pitched his camp. As the two armies lay here opposite one another, there came in the night, a multitude of field-mice, which devoured all the quivers and bowstrings of the enemy, and 
2 CONC ate the thongs by which they managed their shields. Next morning they commenced their fight, and great multitudes fell, as they had no arms with which to defend themselves. There stands to this day in
2 CONC  the temple of Vulcan, a stone statue of Sethos, with a mouse in his hand, and an inscription to this effect - "Look on me, and learn to reverence the gods."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Detailed analysis</p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib's first act was to break up the powerful combination of princes who were in league against him, among whom was Hezekiah, who had entered into an alliance with Egypt. Sennacherib accordi
2 CONC ngly led a very powerful army (reportedly 200,000 men in size) into Judah, and devastated the land on every side, taking and destroying many cities (2 Kings 18:13-16; compare Isaiah 22, 24, 29, and 2 
2 CONC Chronicles 32:1-8).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(See Isa. 22:1-13 for a description of the feelings of the inhabitants of Jerusalem at such a crisis.)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hezekiah was not disposed to become an Assyrian vassal. He accordingly at once sought help from Egypt (2 Kings 18:20-24). Sennacherib, hearing of this, marched a second time into Palestine (2 Kings
2 CONC  18:17, 37; 19; 2 Chr. 32:9-23; Isa. 36:2-22. Isa. 37:25 should be rendered "dried up all the Nile-arms of Matsor", i.e., of Egypt, so called from the "Matsor" or great fortification across the isthmu
2 CONC s of Suez, that protected it from invasions from the east). Sennacherib sent envoys to try to persuade Hezekiah to surrender, but in vain. He next sent a threatening letter (2 Kings 19:10-14), which H
2 CONC ezekiah carried into the temple and spread before the Lord. Isaiah again brought an encouraging message to the pious king (2 Kings 19:20-34). "In that night" the angel of the Lord went forth and smote
2 CONC  the camp of the Assyrians. In the morning, "behold, they were all dead corpses". The Assyrian army was annihilated.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sennacherib did not campaign again against Jerusalem. He was murdered by two of his own sons (Adrammelech and Sharezer), and was succeeded by another son, Esarhaddon (681 BC), after a reign of twen
2 CONC ty-four years.

2 CONT <p>In this relief Naqi'a-Zakutu is behind her son King Esarhaddon of Assyria in the temple of Marduk. The relief commemorates the restoration of Babylon by Esarhaddon. Naqi’a (c. 680–627 BC, Assyr
2 CONC ia) held an advisory position to the throne under the title of queen mother during the reigns of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, her son and grandson.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Biography	Edit</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Naqi’a joined Sennacherib’s harem and bore a son, Esarhaddon, in c. 713 BC.[1] After the murder of Sennacherib’s eldest son, Assur-nadin-sumi, in 694, Sennacherib waited almost eleven years b
2 CONC efore designating another heir. Eventually he named Esarhaddon, his youngest son, to the post, thus supplanting his eldest son, Urad-Mullissu, who as eldest son had expected to succeed his father. Dur
2 CONC ing the brief two-year period when Esarhaddon was crown prince, he and his mother had to strive constantly to maintain their positions. Eventually, Esarhaddon was forced to go into hiding. Naqi'a does
2 CONC  not appear in our sources until Esarhaddon’s promotion and it is not certain when, if at all, Naqi'a achieved first wife status.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>She was at court in Nineveh when her husband was murdered and remained there through the ensuing troubles, during which time she sought news of the future from prophetesses. Most of our information
2 CONC  dates to the reign of her son, Esarhaddon. To this period belong the letters addressed to her and those in which she is mentioned. We also have the building inscription from a palace that she had bui
2 CONC lt for Esarhaddon, two dedicatory inscriptions, and administrative and economic documents indicating that she was very wealthy and supported a large household staff. When her son died she imposed a lo
2 CONC yalty oath on behalf of her grandson, Ashurbanipal, and, although she may have lived longer, that is the last evidence we have of her.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Origins	Edit</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The only thing we know of Naqi'a's family is that she had a sister, Abi-rami.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Because Naqia sometimes adopted the Akkadian name Zakutu, a translation of Naqi'a, scholars have assumed that she was not native to Assyria. Some scholars suggest that Naqia was Hebrew while others
2 CONC  contend that she was one of the women that Hezekiah sent to Sennacherib in 701 BC.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Naqia was probably born in Babylonia, but her family may have originated in the Harran area. The suggestion that Naqia originally came from the West is based on the fragment of a bronze relief now 
2 CONC in the Louvre, where Naqia is depicted standing behind the king. She holds a mirror in her left hand and a plant in her right hand. Scholars point out that the motif of a woman holding a mirror is Syr
2 CONC ian/Anatolian in origin and appears in Assyrian art here for the first time. [1]

2 CONT <p>Herodotus – Candaules, his wife and Gyges</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed by William Etty. This image illustrates Herodotus's version of the tale of Gyges. According to
2 CONC  The Histories of Herodotus,[4] Candaules bragged of his wife's incredible beauty to his favorite bodyguard, Gyges of Lydia. "It appears you don't believe me when I tell you how lovely my wife is," sa
2 CONC id the King. "A man always believes his eyes better than his ears; so do as I tell you—contrive to see her naked."[5]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gyges refused; he did not wish to dishonor Nyssia, the Queen, by seeing her nude body.[6] He also feared what the King might do to him if he did accept.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Candaules was insistent, and Gyges had no choice but to obey. The King detailed a plan by which Gyges would hide behind a door in the royal bedroom to observe Nyssia disrobing before bed. Gyges wou
2 CONC ld then leave the room while the Queen's back was turned.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>That night, the plan was executed. However, the Queen saw Gyges as he left the room, and recognized immediately that she had been betrayed and shamed by her own husband. She silently swore to have 
2 CONC her revenge, and began to arrange her own plan.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The next day, the Queen summoned Gyges to her chamber. Although Gyges thought nothing of the routine request, she confronted him immediately with her knowledge of his misdeed and her husband's. "On
2 CONC e of you must die," Nyssia declared. "Either my husband, the author of this wicked plot; or you, who have outraged propriety by seeing me naked."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gyges pleaded with the Queen not to force him to make this choice. She was relentless, and eventually he chose to betray the King so that he should live.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Queen prepared for Gyges to kill Candaules by the same manner in which she was shamed. Gyges hid behind the door of the bedroom chamber with a knife provided by the Queen, and killed him in his
2 CONC  sleep. Gyges married the Queen and became King, and father to the Mermnad Dynasty.

2 CONT <p>Added by Janet Milburn 10/23/20</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Candaules (died c.687 BC; Greek: Κανδαύλης, Kandaulēs), also known as Myrsilos (Μυρσίλος),[1] was a king of the ancient Kingdom of Lydia in the early years of the 7th century BC. 
2 CONC According to Herodotus, he succeeded his father Meles as the 22nd and last king of Lydia's Heraclid dynasty. He was assassinated and succeeded by Gyges.[1][2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Based on an ambiguous line in the work of the Greek poet Hipponax, it was traditionally assumed that the name of Candaules meant "hound-choker" among the Lydians.[3] J. B. Bury and Russell Meiggs (
2 CONC 1975) say that Candaules is a Maeonian name meaning "hound-choker" and that Aryan conquerors (the Heraclids in Greek tradition) had occupied the Lydian throne for centuries.[2] More recently, however,
2 CONC  it has been suggested that the name or title Kandaules is cognate with the Luwian hantawatt(i)– ("king") and probably has Carian origin.[4] The name or title Candaules is the origin of the term can
2 CONC daulism, for a sexual practice attributed to him by legend.[5]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Several stories of how the Heraclid dynasty of Candaules ended and the Mermnad dynasty of Gyges began have been related by different authors throughout history, mostly in a mythical sense. In Plato
2 CONC 's Republic, Gyges used a magical ring to become invisible and usurp the throne, a plot device which reappeared in numerous myths and works of fiction throughout history.[6] The earliest story, relate
2 CONC d by Herodotus in the 5th century BC, has Candaules betrayed and executed by his wife, Nyssia, in a cautionary tale against pride and possession.[7]

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Candaules often told his favourite bodyguard, Gyges, how beautiful the queen was and, thinking Gyges did not believe him, urged Gyges to contrive to see her naked. Gyges initially refused as he did
2 CONC  not wish to dishonor the queen. Nevertheless, Candaules was insistent and Gyges had no option but to obey his king. So Gyges hid in Candaules' bedroom and, when the queen entered, watched her undress
2 CONC . As she was getting into bed, he quietly left the room, but the queen saw him and realised what had happened.[9] Herodotus commented: "For with the Lydians, as with most barbarian (i.e., non-Greek) r
2 CONC aces, it is thought highly indecent even for a man to be seen naked".[10]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The queen silently swore revenge for her shame. Next day, she summoned Gyges to her chamber. Gyges thought it was a routine request, but she confronted him immediately and presented him with two ch
2 CONC oices. One was to kill Candaules and seize the throne with Nyssia as his wife. The second was to be executed immediately by her trusted servants. Gyges pleaded with her to relent but she would not. He
2 CONC  decided to take the first course of action and assassinate the king. The plan was that he should hide in the royal bedroom as before but this time from the king. After Candaules fell asleep, Gyges cr
2 CONC ept forward and stabbed him to death.[10]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gyges married the queen as she had insisted but many Lydians did not at first accept him as their ruler. In order to prevent a civil war, Gyges offered to have his position confirmed or refused by 
2 CONC the Delphic Oracle. He agreed that he would restore the throne to the Heracleidae if the Oracle declared against him. The Oracle supported him and his dynasty was established. The Priestess of the Shr

2 CONT <p>Gyges of Lydia</p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gyges was the founder of the third or Mermnad dynasty of Lydian kings and reigned from 687 BC to 652 BC (some claim 690 BC-657 BC). He was succeeded by his son Ardys II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Authors throughout history have told differing stories of Gyges rise to power. Gyges was the son of Dascylus. Dascylus was recalled from banishment in Cappadocia by the Lydian king Sadyates, called
2 CONC  Candaules, or "the Dog-strangler" by the Greeks, and sent his son back to Lydia instead of himself.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Nicolaus of Damascus, Gyges soon became a favourite of Sadyates and was dispatched by him to fetch Tudo, the daughter of Arnossus of Mysia, whom the Lydian king wished to make his quee
2 CONC n. On the way Gyges fell in love with Tudo, who complained to Sadyates of his conduct. Forewarned that the king intended to punish him with death, Gyges assassinated Sadyates in the night and seized t
2 CONC he throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Plutarch, Gyges seized power with the help of Arselis of Mylasa, the captain of the Carian bodyguard, whom he had won over to his cause.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the account of Herodotus, which may be traced to the poet Archilochus of Paros, Candaules insisted upon showing Gyges his wife when unrobed, which so enraged her that she gave Gyges the choice o
2 CONC f murdering her husband and making himself king, or of being put to death himself.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Finally, in the more allegorical account of Plato, Gyges was a shepherd, who discovered a magic ring by means of which he murdered the King and won the affection of the Queen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In all cases, civil war ensued on the death of the King, which was only ended when Gyges sought to justify his ascendence to the throne by petitioning for the approval of the Oracle at Delphi.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Herodotus, he plied the Oracle with numerous gifts, notably six mixing bowls minted of gold extracted from the Pactolus river weighing thirty talents— an amount which would fetch ove
2 CONC r US$13 million at 2006 prices. The Oracle confirmed Gyges as the rightful Lydian King, gave moral support to the Lydians over the Asian Greeks, and also claimed that the dynasty of Gyges would be pow
2 CONC erful, but due to his usurpation of the throne would fall in the fifth generation. This claim was later proven true, though perhaps by the machination of the Oracle's successor. Gyges 4th descendant, 
2 CONC Croesus, lost the kingdom after misunderstanding a prophecy of the later Oracle, and fatefully attacking the Persian armies of Cyrus the Great.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Once established on the throne, Gyges devoted himself to consolidating his kingdom and making it a military power. The Troad was conquered, Colophon captured from the Greeks, Smyrna besieged and al
2 CONC liances entered into with Ephesus and Miletus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The armies of Gyges beat back the Cimmerii, who had ravaged Asia Minor. An embassy was sent to Assur-bani-pal at Nineveh circa 650 BC in the hope of obtaining his help against the barbarians. The A
2 CONC ssyrians were otherwise engaged, and Gyges turned to Egypt, sending his faithful Carian troops along with Ionian mercenaries to assist Psammetichus in shaking off the Assyrian yoke circa 660 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gyges later fell in battle against the Cimmerii under Dugdamme (called Lygdamis by Strabo i. 3. 21), who took the lower town of Sardis. Gyges was succeeded by his son Ardys.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Many Bible scholars believe that Gyges of Lydia was the Biblical figure of Gog, ruler of Magog, who is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Revelation.

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Sargon II (Akkadian Šarru-ukin "he [= the god] made firm the king"; reigned 722 – 705 BC) was an Assyrian king. Sargon II became the ruler of the Assyrian Empire in 722 BC after the

2 CONT <p>Sargon II, captor of Samaria, with a dignitarySargon II (r. 721 BC-705 BC) was an Assyrian king. He took the throne from Shalmanassar V in 722 BC. It is not clear if he was the son of Tiglatpilesar
2 CONC  III or a usurper unrelated to the royal family. In his inscriptions, he styles himself as a new man, rarely referring to his predecessors, and he took the name Sharru-kinu, true king, after Sargon of
2 CONC  Akkad, a mighty king who had been found in a wicker basket, a child of a temple prostitute and an unknown father. Sargon is the name given by the Bible.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Beset by difficulties at the beginning of his rule, Sargon made a pact with the Chaldean Marduk-apla-iddin. He freed all temples, as well as the inhabitants of the towns of Assur and Harran from ta
2 CONC xes. While Sargon was thus trying to gain support in Assyria, Marduk-apla-iddin conquered Babylon with the help of the new Elamite king Ummanigash and was crowned king in 721.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 720 Sargon moved against Elam, but the Assyrian host was defeated near Der. Later this year, Sargon defeated a Syrian coalition at Qarqar, which gained him control of Arpad, Simirra and Damascus
2 CONC . Sargon conquered Gaza in Palestine, destroyed Raphia and won a victory over Egyptian troops. On his way back, he had Samaria rebuilt as the capital of the new province of Samerina and settled it wit
2 CONC h Arabs.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 717 he conquered parts of the Zagros mountains and the Hittite city of Carchemish on the Upper Euphrates. In 716 he moved against the kingdom of Mannai, where the ruler Aza, son of Iranzu, had b
2 CONC een deposed by Ullusunu with the help of the Urartians. Sargon took the capital Izirtu, and stationed troops in Parsuash (original home of Persian tribe, on lake Urmia) and Kar-Nergal (Kishesim). He b
2 CONC uilt new bases in Media as well, the main being Harhar and Kar-Sharrukin. In 715, others were to follow: Kar-Nabu, Kar-Sin and Kar-Ishtar, all named after Babylonian gods and resettled by Assyrian sub
2 CONC jects.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The 8th campaign of Sargon against Urartu in 714 is well known from a letter from Sargon to the god Ashur (found in the town of Assur, now in the Louvre, Paris) and the bas-reliefs in the palace of
2 CONC  Dur-Sharrukin. The campaign was probably motivated by the fact that the Urartians had been weakened by incursions of the Cimmerians, a nomadic steppe tribe. One Urartian army had been completely anni
2 CONC hilated, and the General Qaqqadanu taken prisoner.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Cimmerians were mentioned a number of times in letters by the crown-prince Sennacherib, who ran his father's intelligence service, that unfortunately cannot be dated exactly, but are believed t
2 CONC o have been composed before 713. The letters relate how Sargon crossed the upper and lower Zab and moved over the mountains of Kullar in the direction of Lake Urmia, crossing the country of Zikirtu, w
2 CONC hose ruler Metatti had fled to Uishdish, the provinces of Surikash, Allabria and parts of Parsuash. The reliefs show the difficulties of the terrain: the war-chariots had to be dismantled and carried 
2 CONC by soldiers (with the king still in the chariot), the latter describes how ways had to be cut into the intractable forests.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After reaching Lake Urmia he turned east and entered Zikirtu and Andia on the Caspian slopes of the Caucasus. When news reached him that king Rusas I of Urartu (730-713 BC) was moving against him, 
2 CONC he turned back to Lake Urmia in forced marches and defeated an Urartian army in a steep valley of the Uaush (probably the Sahend, east of Lake Urmia, or further to the South, in Mannaean country), a s
2 CONC teep mountain that reached the clouds and whose flanks were covered by snow. The battle is described as the usual carnage, but King Rusas managed to escape. The horses of his chariot had been killed b
2 CONC y Assyrian spears, forcing him to ride a mare in order to get away, very unbecoming for a king.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sargon plundered the fertile lands at the southern and western shore of Lake Urmia, felling orchards and burning the harvest. In the royal resort of Ulhu, the wine-cellar of the Urartian kings was 
2 CONC plundered; wine was scooped up like water. The Assyrian host then plundered Sangibuti and marched north to Van without meeting resistance, the people having retreated to their castles or fled into the
2 CONC  mountains, having been warned by fire-signals. Sargon claims to have destroyed 430 empty villages.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After reaching Lake Van, Sargon left Urartu via Uaiaish. In Hubushkia he received the tribute of Nairi. While most of the army returned to Assyria, Sargon went on to sack the Urartian temple of the
2 CONC  god Haldi and his wife Bagbartu at Musasir (Ardini). The loot must have been impressive; its description takes up 50 columns in the letter to Assur. More than 1 ton of gold and 5 tons of silver fell 
2 CONC into the hands of the Assyrians; 334,000 objects in total. A relief from Dur Sharrukin depicted the sack of Musasir as well (that unfortunately fell into the Tigris in 1846 when Botta transported his 
2 CONC loot to Paris). Musasir was annexed. Sargon claims to have lost only one charioteer, 2 horsemen and three couriers on this occasion. King Rusa was understandably despondent when he heard of the loss o
2 CONC f Musasir, and fell ill. According to the imperial annals, he took his own life with his own iron sword, like a pig.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 713 Sargon stayed at home; his troops took, among others, Karalla, Tabal and Cilicia. Some Mede rulers offered tribute. In 711, Gurgum was conquered. A rising in Ashdod, supported by Judah, Moab
2 CONC , Edom and Egypt was suppressed, and Ashdod became an Assyrian province.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 710 Sargon felt safe enough in his rule to move against his Babylonian arch-enemy. One army moved against Elam and her new king Shutruk-Nahhunte II (Shutur-Nahundi); the other, under Sargon hims
2 CONC elf, against Babylon. Sargon laid siege to Babylon, and Marduk-apla-iddin fled. He was finally captured in the swamps of the Shatt-el-Arab (though as he seems to have proven a thorn in the side of Sen
2 CONC nacherib later on, this might not have been quite true). Southern Babylonia, settled by nomadic Aramaic tribes, was conquered and turned into the province of Gambulu.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the capture of Marduk-apla-iddin, Babylon yielded to Sargon and he was proclaimed king of Babylonia in 710, thus restoring the dual monarchy of Babylonia and Assyria. He remained in Babylon f
2 CONC or three years. In 709, he led the new-year procession as king of Babylon. He had his son, crown-prince Sennacherib, married to the Aramaic noblewoman Naqi'a, and stayed in the south to pacify the Ara
2 CONC maic and Chaldean tribes of the lower Euphrates as well as the Suti nomads. Some areas at the border to Elam were occupied as well.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 710, the seven kings of Ia' (Cyprus) had accepted Assyrian sovereignty; in 709 Midas, king of Phrygia, beset by the nomadic Cimmerians, submitted to Assyrian rule and in 708, Kummuhu (Commagene)
2 CONC  became an Assyrian province. Assyria was at the apogee of its power. Urartu had almost succumbed to the Cimmerians, Elam was weakened, Marduk-apla-iddin was momentarily powerless, and the Egyptian in
2 CONC fluence in Syria was temporarily waning as well.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sargon preferred Niniveh to the traditional capital at Ashur. In 713 he ordered the construction of a new palace and town called Dur-Sharrukin (House of Sargon, Khorsabad), 20 km north of Niniveh a
2 CONC t the foot of the Gebel Musri. Land was bought, and the debts of construction workers were nullified in order to attract a sufficient labour force. The land in the environs of the town was taken under
2 CONC  cultivation, and olive groves were planted to increase Assyria's deficient oil-production. The town was of rectangular layout and measured 1760 by 1635 m. The length of the walls was 16,280 Assyrian 
2 CONC units, corresponding to the numerical value of Sargon's name. The town was partly settled by prisoners of war and deportees under the control of Assyrian officials ,who had to assure they were paying 
2 CONC sufficient respect to the gods and the king. The court moved to Dur-Sharrukin in 706, although it was not completely finished yet.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 705, Sargon fell in a campaign against the Cimmerians, who were later to destroy the kingdoms of Urartu and Phrygia before moving even further west. Sargon was followed by his son Sennacherib (S
2 CONC in-ahhe-eriba, 704-681 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Under his rule the Assyrians completed the defeat of the Kingdom of Israel, capturing Samaria after a siege of three years and dispersing the inhabitants. This became the basis of the legend of the
2 CONC  Lost Ten Tribes.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tiglath-pileser III (reigned 745-727 bc), considered the founder of the last Assyrian Empire, which stretched from present-day Iran to Israel. Tiglath-pileser reestablished the Assyrian Empire as a
2 CONC  dynamic power after half a century of anarchy and stagnation. He is also significant for implementing a centralized system of government that allowed him and his successors to rule vast stretches of 
2 CONC territory—a formidable challenge at the time. Little is known about his background or early life, but he likely seized rather than inherited the throne of Assyria in 745 bc. He took the name Tiglath
2 CONC -pileser III in the tradition of Tiglath-pileser I (ruled 1115-1076 bc), a heroic Assyrian warrior king. Tiglath-pileser III conquered the Syrian kingdoms, including Damascus, in 732 bc. He then broug
2 CONC ht the Phoenician coastal cities, Israel, and Gaza into the empire, and extended his influence as far west as the Anatolian Plateau in modern-day Turkey. His conquests were consolidated through a dras
2 CONC tic administrative reorganization, which involved the establishment of Assyrian provinces with Assyrian local governors and the deportation and resettlement of as many as 200,000 people.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 729 bc, after a struggle for the throne of Babylon following the death of Babylon's king, Tiglath-pileser took the throne of the holy city himself. Babylon already lay within Tiglath-pileser's k
2 CONC ingdom, but he had allowed a lesser king to rule the city—probably out of respect for its religious importance. Rather than reduce Babylon to the status of other conquered provinces, Tiglath-pileser
2 CONC  took the name of Pulu and ruled the city as a separate-but-equal entity within his kingdom. He was succeeded by his son Shalmaneser V.

2 CONT <p>[edit] OriginsFormer governor of Kalhu (Biblical Calah/Nimrud)[3] and a general, Pulu was a usurper who assumed his Assyrian throne name from two more legitimate predecessors. He described himself 
2 CONC as a son of Adad-nirari III in his inscriptions, but it is uncertain if this is truthful. He seized the throne in the midst of civil war on 13 Ayaru, 745 BC.[5][1] As a result of Pulu seizing the thro

2 CONT <p>[edit] Reign  Tiglath-Pileser III besieging a townAssyrian power in the Near East greatly increased as the result of Tiglath-Pileser's military reforms (see "Reforms" below) and his campaigns of co
2 CONC nquest. Upon ascending the throne, he claimed (in Annal 9, which dates to 745 BC, his first regnal year) to have annexed Babylonia, from "Dur-(Kuri)galzu, Sippar of Shamash, ... the cities [of Ba]bylo
2 CONC nia up to the Uqnu river [by the shore of the Lo]wer [Sea]"[6] (which referred to the Persian Gulf), and subsequently placed his eunuch over them as governor. Also in his first year of reign he defeat
2 CONC ed the powerful kingdom of Urartu (modern Armenia), whose hegemony under the rulership of Sarduri II had extended to Asia Minor, northern Mesopotamia,western Iran and Syria; there he found unrivalled 
2 CONC horses for his war-chariots.[7] He also defeated the Medes before making war on and conquering the Neo-Hittites, Syria and Phoenicia. He took Arpad in 740 BC after three years of siege, annexed it as 
2 CONC a province (over which he placed one of his eunuchs as governors), and subjected Hamath to tribute. Assyrian inscriptions record in 740 BC, the fifth year of his reign, a victory over Azariah (Uzziah)
2 CONC , king of Judah, whose achievements are described in 2 Chronicles 26.He also subjugated Damascus, the Arabs under Queen Zabibe, Menahem of Israel and Sam'al's king Azriyau, who all paid him tribute.[8
2 CONC ] In 737 and 736 BC he turned his attention again to Iran, conquering the Medes and Persians and occupying a large part of Iran.[8] According to the royal inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser many of the i
2 CONC nhabitants were enslaved and deported to other parts of the Assyrian empire, as commonly done by his predecessors. At sieges captives were slaughtered and their bodies raised on stakes and displayed b

2 CONT <p>In October 729 BC, Tiglath-Pileser assumed total control of Babylon, capturing the Babylonian king Nabu-mukin-zeri (ABC 1 Col.1:21) and having himself crowned as "King Pulu of Babylon".

2 CONC  thousands of people all over the empire.[9]Biblical records, corroborated by Assyrian ones, describe how Tiglath-Pileser III exacted 1000 talents of silver tribute from King Menahem of Israel (2 King
2 CONC s 15:19) and defeated his successor Pekah (15:29). Pekah had allied with Rezin, king of the Arameans against Ahaz (known to the Assyrians as Yahu-khazi), king of Judah, who responded by appealing for 
2 CONC the Assyrian monarch's help with the Temple gold and silver. Tiglath-Pileser complied by seizing Damascus, executing Rezin, and deporting the Aramaean inhabitants to Kir (16:9). He also seized the nor
2 CONC thern half of Israel, and deported the Reubenites, Gadites, and Manasseh to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the Gozan river (1 Chron. 5:26). Beyond this, the alliance was not beneficial to Ahaz. (2 Chron 28:2

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] ReformsUpon ascending the throne, Tiglath-Pileser instituted several reforms to different sectors of the Assyrian state, which arguably revived Assyria's hegemony over the Near East.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The first of such reforms entailed thwarting the powers of the high Assyrian officials, which during the reigns of his predecessors had become excessive. Officials such as Šamši-ilu, who was turt
2 CONC anu and a prominent official since the time of Adad-Nirari III, often led their own campaigns and erected their own commemorative stelae, often without mentioning the king at all.[10] Since his earlie
2 CONC st inscriptions (and thus from the beginning of his reign), he gave regular mention of appointing eunuchs as governors of (newly conquered) provinces; this removed the threat of provincial rule becomi
2 CONC ng a dynastic matter. He also sought to reduce the power of his officials by reducing the size of the provinces (in some cases the northern provinces were increased to include newly conquered territor
2 CONC ies), thus decreasing their resources, should they have desired to incite a revolt. Subsequently, there were more provinces, more governors (most of which were eunuchs), and less power per governor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The second reform targeted the army. Instead of a largely native Assyrian army which normally campaigned only in the summer time, Tiglath-Pileser incorporated large numbers of conquered people into
2 CONC  the army, thus adding a substantial foreign element. This force mainly comprised the infantry, whereas the native Assyrians comprised the cavalry and chariotry. As a result of Tiglath-Pileser's milit
2 CONC ary reforms, the Assyrian Empire was armed with a greatly expanded army which could campaign throughout the year. The addition of the cavalry and the chariot contingents to the army was mostly due to 
2 CONC the steppe cultures lurking nearby to the north, which sometimes invaded their northern lands, using mainly cavalry and primitive chariots.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] LegacyTiglath-Pileser III's conquests and reforms led to the establishment of the Neo-Assyrian Kingdom as a true empire. He built a royal palace in Nimrud (the so-called "central palace"), l
2 CONC ater dismantled by Esarhaddon. He had his royal annals engraved across the bas-reliefs depicting his military achievements on the sculptured slabs decorating his palace.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On his death he was succeeded by his son Ululayu, who took the name Shalmaneser V and further campaigned in the Levant, and captured Samaria.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tiglath-Pileser III — stela from the walls of his palace (British Museum, London)Tiglath-Pileser III or IV (or Tilgath-Pil-neser or Tiglatpilesar III), was a prominent king of Assyria in the 8th 
2 CONC century BC (ruled 744–727 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The name Tiglath-Pileser was a throne-name — that is, one given to the king on his accession to the throne, rather than a name given at birth. In translation, it means "my confidence is the son o
2 CONC f Esarra." It is given in several different forms in historical records. The Bible records him as Tillegath-pilneser (2 Chronicles 28:20) and the much-abbreviated Pul (1 Chronicles 5:26 and 2 Kings 15
2 CONC :19,20). In Assyrian cuneiform, his name is given as Tukulti-apil-esarra, which has been rendered into modern languages as Tiglath-Pileser - a great cat name.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His origins are unknown but he may have been a usurper who assumed the name of a more legitimate predecessor. Under his rule, Assyrian power in the Near East greatly increased as the result of camp
2 CONC aigns of conquest mounted against western kingdoms. Assyrian inscriptions record, in the fifth year of his reign (739 BC), a victory over Azariah (Uzziah), king of Judah, whose achievements are descri
2 CONC bed in 2 Chronicles 26:6-15. In 733 BC his armies conquered Philistia on the Mediterranean coast, destroyed Damascus and occupied most of Israel, with its northern regions becoming Assyrian provinces.
2 CONC  Many of the inhabitants were impaled or deported to other parts of the Assyrian empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>These events were recorded in the Bible, which describes how Tiglath-Pileser III defeated Pekah, king of Israel, and Rezin, king of the Arameans, who had allied against him. He executed Rezin and P
2 CONC ekah was murdered by Hoshea, who took control of the rump Israelite kingdom as a vassal paying tribute to the Assyrians. (2 Kings 15:29; 16:5-9; 1 Chronicles 5:6, 26) Ahaz (known to the Assyrians as Y
2 CONC ahu-khazi), the king of Judah, was also forced to pay tribute to the Assyrian conqueror (2 Kings 16:10-16).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tiglath-Pileser III's conquests paved the way for the establishment of the Second Assyrian Empire. On his death, the Assyrian throne was seized by Ululai, the governor of Babylon, who assumed the n

2 CONT <p>Adad-nirari III (also Adad-narari) was a King of Assyria from 811 to 783 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] FamilyAdad-nirari was a son and successor of king Shamshi-Adad V and was apparently quite young at the time of his accession, because for the first five years of his reign his mother Shammur
2 CONC amat[2] acted as regent, which may have given rise to the legend of Semiramis.[3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It is widely rejected that his mother acted as regent, but she was surprisingly influential for the time period.[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was a father of kings Ashur-nirari V, Shalmaneser IV and Ashur-dan III.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tiglath-Pileser III described himself as a son of Adad-nirari in his inscriptions, but it is uncertain if this is truthful.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] BiographyAdad-nirari's youth, and the struggles his father had faced early in his reign, caused a serious weakening for the Assyrian rulership over Mesopotamia, and gave way to the ambitions
2 CONC  of the most officers, governors and the local rulers.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Adad-nirari's inscriptions, he led several military campaigns with the purpose of regaining the strength Assyria enjoyed in the times of his grandfather Shalmaneser III.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the eponym canon, he campaigned in all directions until the last of his 28 years of reign, and he was the builder of the temple of Nabu at Nineveh. Among his actions was a siege of Dam
2 CONC ascus in the time of Ben-Hadad III in 796 BCE, which led to the eclipse of the Aramaean Kingdom of Damascus and allowed the recovery of Israel under Jehoash (who paid the Assyrian king tribute at this
2 CONC  time) and Jeroboam II. Additionally, he is thought by some to be the "King of Nineveh" who, upon receiving Jonah's prophecy of forthcoming doom, dressed himself in sackcloth and ordered a fast throug

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Adad-nirari III (also Adad-narari) was King of Assyria from 811 to 783 BC. He was the son and successor of Shamshi-Adad V, and was apparently quite young at the time of his accession, because for t
2 CONC he first five years of his reign his mother Sammuramat acted as regent, which may have given rise to the legend of Semiramis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Adad-nirari's youth, and the struggles his father had faced early in his reign, caused a serious weakening for the Assyrian rulership over Mesopotamia, and gave way to the ambitions of the most hig
2 CONC h officers, the governors and the local rulers.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Adad-nirari's inscriptions, he led several military campaigns with the purpose of regaining the strength Assyria enjoyed in the times of his grand-father, Shalmaneser III. According to
2 CONC  the eponym canon, he campaigned in all directions until the last of his 28 years of reign, and he was the builder of the temple of Nabu at Nineveh. Among his actions was a siege of Damascus in the ti
2 CONC me of Ben-Hadad III in 796 BC, which led to the eclipse of the Aramaean Kingdom of Damascus and allowed the recovery of Israel under Jehoash (who paid the Assyrian king tribute at this time) and Jerob
2 CONC oam II.

2 CONT <p>In spite of Adad-nirari's vigor, Assyria entered a several decades long period of weakness following his death.

2 CONT <p>The historical Assyrian queen Shammuramat (Semiramis), wife of Shamshi-Adad V of Assyria, certainly existed. After her husband's death, she served as regent from 810 - 806 BC for her son, Adad-nira

2 CONT <p>Legend</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Legend tells that she was born in the desert and raised by doves. Sammuramat, or Semiramis, was the Queen of Assyria and the legendary wife of Nimrod. She was famed for her beauty, and even more so
2 CONC  for her military insight that won many battles and conquered many cities. Some believe her to have begun goddess worship, with herself as the original Ishtar. Legend and truth are hard to distinguish
2 CONC .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Other legends have it that she was born of the goddess Atargatis, that her army attacked and killed the sun-god Er, or that she was born because a vengeful Astarte caused the goddess Derceto (a mer
2 CONC maid-goddess) to fall in love with a Syrian boy named Caystrus, so that Derceto abandoned the child to the doves in shame.
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Historical View</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>All of these things aside, historical fact mentions that the widow of King Shamshi-Adad V reigned for three years on the throne of Babylon. Everything else is based in Greek lore and historically u
2 CONC nreliable.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The way the Greeks have it, Semiramis was the wife of Biblical Nimrod of Assyria/Sumeria, and was astoundingly beautiful. She always wore around her neck a silver charm in the shape of a very arrow
2 CONC -like dove, given to her by her first husband, and men were driven to madness by the sight of her beauty. She was discovered by shepherds after being raised by the doves, and the Kin'’s advisor, Men
2 CONC os, passing through for inspections, noticed her charms and took her and married her. In some versions, they have twins, Hyapate and Hydaspe.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Menos had one day sent for her on the battlefield, Semiramis displayed her military genius by attacking the flank of the besieged city with mountaineers, therefore winning the city for the ki
2 CONC ng. King Ninus was so impressed that he first coaxed and then coerced Menos to give Semiramis to him, after which he committed suicide. With Ninus she had a son named Ninyas. Ninus was much older and 
2 CONC extremely jealous, and after many years under his roof, Semiramis, the apple of his eye, asked permission to rule for just one day. After Ninus agreed and Semiramis was crowned over him, she had him e
2 CONC xecuted and continued to rule forcefully and intelligently for the next 42 years.
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Other Views</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In other versions, after Sammuramat had an illegitimate son whom she named Damu (Dammuzi, Tammuz, Adonis) and was enstranged from her husband Nimrod (Ninus), she was nonetheless given permission to
2 CONC  oversee a religious festival of a cult that she herself had started. In the ceremony, a ram was traditionally torn to pieces at the bare hands of high (read: drugged-out) priesthood, however Sammuram
2 CONC at slyly switched Nimrod for the ram, and he was killed instead. She then crowned her infant son and reigned as his regent for 42 years.
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Legacy</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During her reign she is credited with both numerous military conquests and the hanging gardens of Babylon. Her life ended when her son (either Ninyas or Damu, depending on the legend) came against 
2 CONC her and killed her, taking over the throne. The mythology of Queen Semiramis is so intertwined with that of her husband, Alexander the Great, future and previous rulers of Babylon and other great peop
2 CONC le, that it is difficult to determine how much the Greeks made up for our enjoyment. Whatever the case, it is possible to discern that Semiramis/ Sammu-ramat was an Angel of Light, described in many l
2 CONC egends as both exceedingly beautiful and exceedingly cruel. She was deified by the ancient Chaldeans, and led them down a path increasingly dark and corrupt. The Queen of Babylon did a good imitation 
2 CONC of the Woman of Babylon, found it Revelation 17:5 (KJV) “And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” She became rege
2 CONC nt after the death of her husband, King Shamshi-Adad V and left a powerful impression of splendor and prosperity. She is credited with rebuilding the city of Babylon and many monuments and personal in
2 CONC scriptions.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Shalmaneser III (Šulmānu-ašarēdu, "the god Shulmanu is pre-eminent")''' was king of Assyria (859 BC – 824 BC), and son of the previous ruler, Ashurnasirpal II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His long reign was a constant series of campaigns against the eastern tribes, the Babylonians, the nations of Mesopotamia and Syria, as well as Kizzuwadna and Urartu. His armies penetrated to Lake 
2 CONC Van and the Taurus Mountains; the Hittites of Carchemish were compelled to pay tribute, and the kingdoms of Hamath and Aram Damascus were subdued.

2 CONC t tribute to him in 841 BC. Babylonia had already been conquered as far as the marshes of the Chaldaeans in the south, and the Babylonian king put to death. It was the Assyrian king who defeated the W
2 CONC estern coalition at Qarqar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Against TibareniIn 836 BC, Shalmaneser sent an expedition against the Tibareni (Tabal) which was followed by one against Cappadocia, and in 832 BC came another campaign against Urartu. In the follo
2 CONC wing year, age required the king to hand over the command of his armies to the Tartan (turtānu commander-in-chief) Dayyan-Assur, and six years later, Nineveh and other cities revolted against him und
2 CONC er his rebel son Assur-danin-pal. Civil war continued for two years; but the rebellion was at last crushed by Shamshi-Adad V, another son of Shalmaneser. Shalmaneser died soon afterwards.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Significance to the BibleHis reign is significant to the Bible (See: Hebrew Bible / Old Testament) because two of his monuments name Biblical figures. The Black Obelisk names Jehu son of Omri and t

2 CONC on the Black Obelisk from Calah.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Black Obelisk is a significant artifact from his reign. It is a black limestone, bas-relief sculpture from Nimrud (ancient Kalhu), in northern Iraq. It is the most complete Assyrian obelisk yet
2 CONC  discovered, and is historically significant because it displays the earliest ancient depiction of an Israelite. On the top and the bottom of the reliefs there is a long cuneiform inscription recordin
2 CONC g the annals of Shalmaneser III. It lists the military campaigns which the king and his commander-in-chief headed every year, until the thirty-first year of reign. Some features might suggest that the
2 CONC  work had been commissioned by the commander-in-chief, Dayyan-Assur.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The second register from the top includes the earliest surviving picture of an Israelite: the Biblical Jehu, king of Israel. Jehu severed Israel’s alliances with Phoenicia and Judah, and became s
2 CONC ubject to Assyria. It describes how Jehu brought or sent his tribute in or around 841 BC. The caption above the scene, written in Assyrian cuneiform, can be translated:

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Shalmaneser III (Šulmanu-ašaredu, "the god Shulmanu is pre-eminent") was king of Assyria (859 BC-824 BC), and son of the previous ruler, Ashurnasirpal II.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His long reign was a constant series of campaigns against the eastern tribes, the Babylonians, the nations of Mesopotamia and Syria, as well as Kizzuwadna and Urartu. His armies penetrated to Lake 
2 CONC Van and the Taurus Mountains; the Hittites of Carchemish were compelled to pay tribute, and the kingdoms of Hamath and Damascus were subdued.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 853 BC a coalition which was formed by the kingdoms of Egypt, Hamath, Arvad, the Ammonites, "Ahab of Israel" and other neighboring states, under the leadership of king Hadadezer of Damascus, inf
2 CONC licted a temporary defeat upon the Assyrian king at Karkar (Qarqar). However, the Assyrian king perservered in his attempts to subjugate Canaan and Syria. Other battles soon followed in 849 BC and 846
2 CONC  BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 842 BC, Shalmaneser campaigned against Hadadezer's successor Hazael, forcing him to take refuge within the walls of his capital. While Shalmaneser was unable to capture Damascus, he devastated i
2 CONC ts territory, and Jehu of Israel (whose ambassadors are represented on the Black Obelisk now in the British Museum), together with the Phoenician cities, prudently sent tribute to him in 841 BC. Babyl
2 CONC onia had already been conquered as far as the marshes of the Chaldaeans in the south, and the Babylonian king put to death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 836 BC, Shalmaneser sent an expedition against the Tibareni (Tabal) which was followed by one against Cappadocia, and in 832 BC came another campaign against Urartu. In the following year, age r
2 CONC equired the king to hand over the command of his armies to the Tartan (turtanu commander-in-chief) Dayyan-Assur, and six years later, Nineveh and other cities revolted against him under his rebel son 
2 CONC Assur-danin-pal. Civil war continued for two years; but the rebellion was at last crushed by Shamshi-Adad V, another son of Shalmaneser. Shalmaneser died soon afterwards. He had built a palace at Cala
2 CONC h, and left several editions of the royal annals recording his military campaigns, the last of which is engraved on the Black Obelisk from Calah.

2 CONC ia from 883 to 859 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ashurnasirpal II succeeded his father, Tukulti-Ninurta II, in 883 BC. During his reign he embarked on a vast program of expansion, first conquering the peoples to the north in Asia Minor as far as 
2 CONC Nairi and exacting tribute from Phrygia, then invading Aram (modern Syria) conquering the Aramaeans and neo Hittites between the Khabur and the Euphrates Rivers. His harshness prompted a revolt that h
2 CONC e crushed decisively in a pitched, two-day battle. According to his monument inscription while recalling this massacre he says "their men young and old I took prisoners. Of some I cut off their feet a
2 CONC nd hands; of others I cut off the ears noses and lips; of the young men's ears I made a heap; of the old men's heads I made a marinet. I exposed their heads as a trophy in front of their city. The mal
2 CONC e children and the female children I burned in flames; the city I destroyed, and consumed with fire." Following this victory, he advanced without opposition as far as the Mediterranean and exacted tri
2 CONC bute from Phoenicia. On his return back home he moved his capital to the city of Kalhu (Nimrud).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ashurnasirpal II's father was Tukulti-Ninurta II. His son and successor was Shalmaneser III.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Reign The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth and art. He was renowned for his brutality, using enslaved captives to build a new 
2 CONC Assyrian capital at Kalhu (Nimrud) in Mesopotamia where he built many impressive monuments. He was also a shrewd administrator who realised that he could gain greater control over his empire by instal

2 CONT <p>Tiglath-pileser III (Tukulti-apil-Esharra, 'my trust is the son of Esharra') came to the throne of Assyria in 745 BC following a revolt that may have been prompted by the threat of invasion from th

2 CONT <p>'''Aššūr-reš-iši II''', inscribed maš-šur-SAG-i-ši, meaning "(the god) Aššur has lifted my head," was the king of Assyria, 971–967 BC, the 96th to be listed on the Assyrian Kinglist.[i

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He succeeded his father, Aššur-rabi II, who had a long 41 year reign. He was probably fairly elderly when the accession took place. He is given in the Synchronistic Kinglist[i 3] as the counterpa
2 CONC rt of the Babylonian king Mâr-bîti-apla-uṣur (983-978 BC), the sole member of the 7th or Elamite dynasty of Babylon, although conventional chronology would suggest the subsequent king, Nabû-mukin
2 CONC -apli (978–943 BC), might be a more likely candidate.[1] The part of the eponym list Cc[i 4] which would have displayed his limmu officials, was at the top of column V, and is obliterated.

2 CONT <p>Apart from the references to him in later copies of the Assyrian Kinglists and in the filiation of his grandson, Aššur-dān II, the only contemporary inscriptions referring to him are from his st

2 CONC  (MAN.KUR aš-šur), son of [A]ššur-[r]abi, king of Assyria," where the term ṣalam is taken to mean "statue."[3] Bēl-eriš, the šangû-priest of the temple of the god Samnuha, in the city of Ša

2 CONT <p>Ashur-rabi IIFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, search Aššur-rabi II, inscribed maš-šur-GAL-bi, “(the god) Aššur is great,”[1] was king of Assyria 1012–972 BC. De
2 CONC spite his lengthy reign (41 years), one of the longest of the Assyrian monarchs, his tenure seems to have been an unhappy one judging by the scanty and laconic references to his setbacks from later so
2 CONC urces.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] BiographyHe was a younger son of the earlier Assyrian monarch, Aššurnaṣirpal I. He succeeded his nephew, Aššur-nerari IV’s brief six year rule, and if this succession was like earlie
2 CONC r usurpations by uncles of their nephews, it would have been a violent affair. The Assyrian Kinglist[i 1][i 2][i 3] records his accession and genealogy but provides no further information. His constru
2 CONC ction of the Bit-nathi, part of the temple of Ištar in Nineveh, was recalled in a dedicatory clone of Aššur-nāṣir-apli II (883–859 BC) commemorating his own repair work.[i 4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some Assyrian settlements on the Middle Euphrates were lost to the Arameans as they were able to cross the river and establish a network of autonomous but interrelated settlements that began to enc
2 CONC roach on the Assyrian heartland.[2] Šulmānu-ašarēdu III recalled the loss of Ana-Aššur-utēr-aṣbat (Pitru, possibly Tell Aushariye) and Mutkinu, two towns close to Til Barsip, which had origin
2 CONC ally been taken and colonized by Tukultī-apil-Ešarra I around a hundred years earlier, in one of his inscriptions: "At the time of Aššur-rabi (II), king of Assyria, the king of Aram (Syria) took [
2 CONC two cities] by force — I restored these cities. I installed the Assyrians in their midst."[i 5] The king of Aram (šar4 KUR-a-ru-mu) is unlikely to have been Hadadezer of Zobah, in southern Syria, b
2 CONC ut a northern Aram in or near Ḫanigalbat.[3] His authority continued to stretch as far west as the Ḫārbūr river as recorded on the cylinder[i 6] of Bel-ereš, a šangû or governor of Šadikanni
2 CONC ,[4] somewhat contradicting the picture of Assyrian retreat and decline painted elsewhere.[5]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His era must have stretched from the reigns of his Babylonian contemporaries, Simbar-Šipak (1025-1008 BC) to Nabû-mukin-apli (978–943 BC), although there is no extant contemporary proof of cont
2 CONC act which might help fix this chronology more precisely. The Synchronistic Kinglist[i 7] gives his contemporary as Širikti-šuqamuna, a king of Babylonia who reigned just 3 months ca. 985 BC. Severe 
2 CONC distress and famine was recorded under Kaššu-nādin-aḫi (ca 1006–1004 BC), the midpoint in Aššur-rabi's reign, and this possibly points to the underlying cause of the Aramean migration.[6]

2 CONT <p>[edit] BiographyAccording to a royal hymn composed in his honor, he was born “in the mountains that nobody knows,” suggesting he may have been born in exile, or perhaps a literary device, as it
2 CONC  continues: “I was without understanding and I prayed not of your majesty.” It relates that, when Ištar appointed him to the kingship, he had restored her overthrown cult. Known from a single cop

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A single short brick-inscription comes from his palace in Assur,[i 2] which was located between the south-west front of the ziggurat and the Anu-Adad temple. The White Obelisk[i 3] is sometimes att
2 CONC ributed to him by historians, but more usually to his later namesake, Aššur-nāṣir-apli II, because its internal content (hunting, military campaigns, etc.) better matches what is known about his 
2 CONC reign.[3] The Synchronistic Kinglist[i 4] gives his Babylonian counterpart as Kaššu-nādin-aḫi (ca 1006–1004 BC), but probably only for stylistic purposes as there seems to have been no recorded

2 CONT <p>Shamshi-Adad IVFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, search Šamši-Adad IV, inscribed mdšam-ši-dIM, was the king of Assyria, 1054/3–1050 BC, the 91st to be listed on the As
2 CONC syrian Kinglist.[i 1][i 2] He was a son of Tukultī-apil-Ešarra I (1114–1076 BC), the third to have taken the throne, after his brothers Ašarēd-apil-Ekur and Ashur-bel-kala, and he usurped the ki
2 CONC ngship from the latter’s son, the short-reigning Erība-Adad II (1055–1054 BC). It is quite probable that he was fairly elderly when he seized the throne.

2 CONT <p>[edit] BiographyThe Assyrian kinglist recalls that he “came up from Karduniaš (i.e. Babylonia). He ousted Erība-Adad, son of Aššur-bêl-kala, seized the throne and ruled for 4 years.” The k

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} ====From ''Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arik-den-ili Arik-den-ili]:====
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Arik-den-ili, inscribed mGÍD-DI-DINGIR, “long-lasting is the judgment of god,”[2] was King of Assyria c. 1317–1306 BC, ruling the Middle Assyrian Empire. He succeeded Enlil-nirari, his fathe
2 CONC r, and was to rule for twelve years and inaugurate the tradition of annual military campaigns against Assyria’s neighbors.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>====Biography====</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The sources are slim for his reign, less than ten inscriptions, a fragmentary chronicle and references to his affairs in those of his son Adad-nirari I’s accounts. He seems to have been the first
2 CONC  of the Assyrian kings to have institutionalized the conduct of annual military campaigns,[3] some of which appear to be little more than livestock-rustling expeditions, as the chronicle mentions “a
2 CONC  hundred head of sheep and goats and a hundred head of their cattle [...] he brought to Aššur.”[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Arik-den-ili’s first victories were against his eastern neighbours (the Pre-Iranic inhabitants of what was to become Persia), Turukku and Nigimhi, and all the chiefs of the (Zagros) mountains and
2 CONC  highlands in the broad tracts of the Gutians to subdue the nomadic tribes on Assyria's northern and eastern frontiers. The Gutians had been vassals of the Kassites who ruled in Babylon and may have a
2 CONC cted as their agents.[5] Nigimhi’s ruler was Esini. The Assyrians had invaded and carried off their harvest and in retaliation Esini led a force into Assyria which resulted in a massacre of his forc
2 CONC es. Arik-den-ili besieged the town of Arnuna, in which Esini was holed up. Destruction of the gate and walls forced Esini’s capitulation and so he swore allegiance to his Assyrian overlord.[6]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The chronicle then lists Habaruha, Kutila, Tarbiṣu, Kudina, Remaku and Nagabbilhi. Of these only Tarbiṣu is known, a town a short distance from Nineveh. The residents of Halahhu seem to have bo
2 CONC rne the brunt of his wrath as he claimed to have killed 254,000 of them,[4] a fairly preposterous boast even for the period. He then turned westward into The Levant (modern Syria and Lebanon), where h
2 CONC e subjugated the Suteans, the Aḫlamû and the Yauru, the nomadic West Semitic tribesmen who would become the Arameans, in the region of Katmuḫi in the middle Euphrates.[6]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But his activities were not limited to warfare. The temple of Šamaš at Aššur, as a mud-brick construction, had decayed into a mound of dirt surrounded by ad hoc shrines. “In order that the ha
2 CONC rvest of my land might prosper,” he had them cleared and rebuilt the temple, laying its foundation during the eponym year of Berutu, a son of the earlier king Eriba-Adad I. His own son credited him 
2 CONC with the construction of the great Ziggurat of Aššur in one of his own building dedications.[6]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Like his father, Enlil-nirari, before him he had to battle inconclusively against Babylonia, in this case against king Nazi-Maruttaš. His son was to recall “my father could not rectify the calam
2 CONC ities inflicted by the army of the king of the Kassite land” in a contemporary Assyrian epic.[5] That dispute was finally resolved with his son, Adad-nirari I's victory over the Babylonians at the B
2 CONC attle of Kār Ištar.

2 CONC 1308 BC (short chronology). He was the son of '''Aššur-uballiṭ I''' .[2] He was apparently the earliest king to have been identified as having held eponym, or limmu, office.[3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] BiographyHe recorded on clay cones his repairs to a dilapidated stretch of the wall from the Craftsman’s Gate to the Sheep Gate around his capital, the city of Assur, now the tell-site of

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His sister, Muballiṭat-Šērūa, was married to the Kassite king Burna-Buriaš II, and his nephews, Kara-ḫardaš and Kurigalzu would succeed to the Babylonian throne, separated by a short-lived
2 CONC  revolt which was put down by Aššur-uballiṭ and the Assyrian army.[5] Around this time, there is evidence of the exchange of gifts of textiles and votive ornaments between the Kassite and Assyrian
2 CONC  ruling classes.[6]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Despite their earlier close ties, he fought against Kurigalzu, who grew to become one of the mightiest and most belligerent kings of the Kassite dynasty, in the battle of Sugagu to establish the bo
2 CONC undary between both states. The two extant chronicles which record the battle provide contradictory accounts of the outcome.[7] The Assyrian version describes the division of land from Shasili of Suba
2 CONC rtu, which was a region thought to be northeast of Assyria and possibly their vassal during this time. A second battle may have taken place at Kilizi as recorded on a poorly preserved chronicle fragme

1 NOTE {geni:about_me}      Bel-bani or Bēl-bāni, inscribed mdEN-ba-ni, “the Lord is the creator,” was the king of Assyria ca. 1700 BC (short chronology) and was the first ruler of what was later to be
2 CONC  called the dynasty of the Adasides. His reign marks the inauguration of a new historical phase following the turmoil of the competing claims of the seven usurpers who preceded him. He was the 48th ki
2 CONC ng to appear on the Assyrian King List and reigned for ten years.     He was the son of Adasi, the last of the seven monarchs who were “sons of nobody,” i.e. unrelated to previous kings, and who h
2 CONC ad competed for the throne over a period of six years. He was to be revered by later monarchs, notably Esarhaddon (681 – 669 BC) but also his second and third sons Shamash-shum-ukin and Ashurbanipal
2 CONC , for restoring stability and founding a dynasty which endured and where he assumed semi-mythical status as their ancestor figure. Esarhaddon described himself as "a lasting offspring (liplippi dārû
2 CONC ) of Belu-bani the son of Adasi, precious scion of Baltil (pir'i BAL.TIL sûquru)." Baltil, the “city of wisdom,” was the name of the ancient precincts of the god Ašshu in the innermost part of t
2 CONC he city of Assur.      He was succeeded by Libaya, which the Assyrian King List gives as his son, although Landsberger has suggested that he was in fact his brother.
