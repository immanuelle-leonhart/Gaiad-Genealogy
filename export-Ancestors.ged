1 NOTE Deianira
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
2 CONT <p>Jump to: navigation, search</p>
2 CONT <p>Like many mortal women in Greek mythology, Deianira (also Deianeira) occupied a perilous threshold position between the daylit world of Olympian gods and heroes and the dark chthonic primordial wor
2 CONC ld of primitive earth magic.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>She was the daughter of Althaea and Oeneus ('wine-man' and thus civilized), the king of Calydon, and the sister of Meleager. However, according to R. Graves, her father was in fact Dionysus. Her fa
2 CONC ther betrothed her to the fearsome river god Achelous, horned and bull-like. Now Deianira was no passive blushing princess. "This Deianira drove a chariot and practised the art of war", noted Apollodo
2 CONC rus (Library and Epitome, book i, 8:1) But she wanted nothing to do with her suitor, who was able to take the form of a sepent or a bull. Heracles, the greatest hero of the dawning Olympian world of g
2 CONC ods and men, had to defeat the river god to win her as his bride.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Deianira's own struggle with the chthonic forces was not over. Later, a wild centaur named Nessus attempted to kidnap Deianira as he was ferrying her across the river Evenus, but she was rescued by
2 CONC  Heracles, who shot the centaur with a poisoned arrow. As he lay dying, Nessus lied to Deianira, telling her that a mixture of the semen that he had dropped on the ground and his heart's blood would e
2 CONC nsure that Heracles would love her forever. Deianira believed his words and kept a little of the potion by her. Heracles fathered illegitimate children all across Greece. When she became uncertain if 
2 CONC Heracles would remain true to her in his fashion, Deianira smeared some of the blood on Heracles' famous hide shirt. Heracles' servant, Lichas, brought him the shirt and he put it on. The centaur's to
2 CONC xic blood killed Heracles. In despair, Deianira committed suicide.

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Heracles was a divine hero in Greek mythology, the son of Zeus and Alcmene, foster son of Amphitryon and great-grandson (and half-brother) of Perseus. He was the greatest of the Greek 
2 CONC heroes, a paragon of masculinity, the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be Heracleidae (Ἡρακλεῖδαι) and a champion of the Olympian order against chthonic monsters. In Rome and the mod
2 CONC ern West, he is known as Hercules.

2 CONT <p>Hera and Zeus are married, although they were always falling in love with mortals. Obviously, neither of them liked it when the other fell in love. One of Zeus's half-blood children was Hercules. (
2 CONC of course this means Hercules's mother was mortal) Hercules' mother Alcmena had no interest in Zeus and did not know that Zeus was the person she thought was her husband. Nine months later Alcmena gav
2 CONC e birth to Hercules, son of Zeus. Zeus was thrilled, but Hera was very unhappy. Angry Hera sent 2 large snakes after Hercules to crush him in his sleep. The snakes glided soundlessly across the floor.
2 CONC  They got ready to attack Hercules. Then, out of nowhere, Hercules jumped out of his crib. He grabbed the snakes and strangled them both. The next morning, servants entered the room. They were very su
2 CONC rprised at what they saw. Two huge snakes lay dead upon the floor and baby Hercules was laughing in his crib. Zeus Hera failed to kill Hercules as a child. That did not stop her from trying again and 
2 CONC again as he grew up. Hera learned that Hercules was hard to kill. He had inherited amazing strength from his father, Zeus. Once Hera realized that she couldn't defeat Hercules by herself, she asked ot
2 CONC her gods to help her. Many of the gods were jealous of Hercules' strength and agreed to help Hera. Zeus knew what Hera was planning. He asked the rest of the gods to help him protect Hercules. Zeus On
2 CONC e of Hercules' first battles was against Cyncus, the cruel son of the war god, Ares. He lived in Thessaly in northern Greece. Cyncus was building a temple to his father. He attacked pilgrims on their 
2 CONC way to the temple, killed them, and stole their belongings. Their skulls became building blocks of the temple of Ares. Hercules was passing the temple when Cyncus dared him to a fight. Their battle di
2 CONC dn't last long. Hercules won. Hera Next, Hercules fought Syleus, a cruel outlaw. Syleus grabbed passing strangers and forced them to work in his vineyards. When they finished their jobs, he murdered t
2 CONC hem. Hercules killed Syleus and brought an end to his reign of terror. Athena Hercules was strong enough to fight against armies of men. The Lapiths were a fierce tribe. Their name means "men of stone
2 CONC  or flint." They were the enemies of the centaurs and fought many battles with these half-men, half-horse creatures. The centaurs asked Hercules to defeat the Lapiths. Hercules did in a huge bloody fi
2 CONC ght. In thanks, the centaurs gave Hercules one third of their kingdom.  Athena Hercules' next big battle was against the cruel King Erginus. A group of Greeks from the city of Thebes had killed King E
2 CONC rginus's father, Clymenus. In revenge, Erginus captured Thebes.He captured Thebes. He demanded a payment of 100 oxen each year for 20 years from its people. This injustice angered the goddess Athena. 
2 CONC She knew Hercules was strong enough to fight Erginus, so she sent him to free Thebes. Hercules cleverly ambushed Erginus and defeated him. The king of Thebes, Creon, was grateful to Hercules. When Her
2 CONC cules fell in love with Creon's daughter, the king happily gave his blessing to the marriage. Hercules married Megara (Creon's daughter) in a royal wedding at Thebes. They had three sons. For a time H
2 CONC ercules was very happy but when Pyraechmus attacked Hercules' new home, Thebes, that changed. Pyraechmus was king of the Euboeans. He wanted to kill Hercules in revenge for the death of his friend Erg
2 CONC inus. Hercules' easily beat the Euboeans. As punishment he tied King Pyraechmus between two horses. Hercules then watched as the horses then tore the king's body in two. This cruel act horrified the p
2 CONC eople of Greece. Pyraechmus' body was left on the banks of the river Heracleius not buried. This was a terrible crime. The gods had ruled that the people should be given a proper burial! When Pyraechm
2 CONC us was defeated, Hera became filled with anger. She put a magic spell upon Hercules. This spell made Hercules think his family was enemy warriors. He killed his wife and his children. Hercules regrett
2 CONC ed his actions the instant the madness wore off. Full of grief, he locked himself away to think about what to do next. Hercules made up his mind to ask the gods for help. He went to Apollo's temple to
2 CONC  see the oracle. Hercules asked her what he could do to make up for his crimes. Hercules did not know Hera controlled the oracle and influenced her words. The oracle told Hercules to be the slave of K
2 CONC ing Eurystheus for 12 years. Artemis Eurystheus had become king of the Tiryns, an important land because of Hera's help. Therefore, whatever Hera asked him to do, he did. Hera and Eurystheus planned t
2 CONC o kill Hercules. They would assign him to dangerous tasks no one could complete and live. If he survived there would be one labor for each of Hercules 12 years of slavery. The twelve tasks are as foll
2 CONC ows:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>1 - King Eurystheus demanded that Hercules killed the lion of Nemea. The creature had magical skin and was huge and cruel. No arrow or spear could pierce his thick hide.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>2 - Hercules was sent to kill the nine headed water snake, the Hydra. Every time a head grew in, two more grew in it's place.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>3 - Hercules had to capture a golden hind alive. This animal is special to Artemis.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>4 - A giant wild boar was attacking the people in the countryside of Erymanthus and Hercules was sent to capture it.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>5 - Hercules was sent to clean out the stables of King Augeas. The stables had never been cleaned before, they were covered in manure. Hercules was given only one day to clean them.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>6 - Hercules was ordered to kill a flock of killer birds called Stymphalian Birds. Stymphalian Birds had beaks, talons, and wings made of iron. They also had arrow-tipped feathers.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>7 - Hercules was ordered to trap a fire breathing bull. The bull was supposed to be sacrificed, but it wasn't so the gods drove it crazy.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>8 - Hercules was sent to capture a herd of man-eating horses and bring them to King Eurystheus.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>9 - Princess Admete wanted to wear the golden belt worn by Hippolyte (the Amazons queen). Eurystheus sent Hercules to get the belt. When Hercules arrived and asked for the belt Queen Hippolyte agre
2 CONC ed to his request. Hera didn't want Hercules to finish another task so she disguised herself to get in his way. She disguised herself as an Amazon and spread stories that Hercules was going to kidnap 
2 CONC the queen. The warriors were angry and attacked Hercules. During the battle, Hercules killed Hippolyte and took the belt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>10 - Hercules was told to kill Geryon, a three headed monster. He had to steal the red cattle that belonged to Geryon.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>11 - Hercules was sent to steal the golden apples that were a wedding present to Hera. Atlas' daughters guard the apples. Atlas was the titan that held up the sky and only his daughters could pick 
2 CONC the apples. Hercules offered to help Atlas by holding up the sky if Atlas ordered his daughters to pick apples. When Atlas' daughters were finished, Atlas would not take back the sky. Hercules then ha
2 CONC d to lie to him in order to escape with the apples.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>12 - King Eurystheus ordered Hercules to bring him the three headed dog, Cerberus from the underworld (where he guards dead people). Even though Eurystheus wanted Cerberus, he was terrified when He
2 CONC rcules brought Cerberus to him because he is a dangerous dog. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hermes Hercules was finally free. Before long Hercules had married Deianira, a wonderful woman. After Hercules got married, the centaur, Nessus attacked Deianira, trying to ruin Hercules' happiness
2 CONC . But, Naturally, Hercules killed him. Deianira had been given drops of Nessus' blood before he died. He promised her it was magic and would keep Hercules in love with her. After many years, Deianira 
2 CONC became worried that Hercules no longer loved her. She put some of The blood on his shirt. But the blood was poison. When Hercules put on his shirt, the poison burned his flesh. Hermes The dying Hercul
2 CONC es lye on a burning funeral pyre. But he did not die, Zeus sent his magic thunderbolts to rescue him. Hercules rode on Zeus's chariot away from Earth. He traveled to Olympus, were Zeus made him immort
2 CONC al. When she realized Hercules was no threat to her, Hera forgave him. From then on Hercules live a peaceful life with the gods.
1 NOTE BIOGRAPHY: Heracles fell in love with Iole, daughter of Eurytus, king of Oechalia. Deianeira, realizing that Iole was a dangerous rival, sent Heracles a garment smeared with the blood of Nessus the Ce
2 CONC ntaur. The blood proved to be a powerful poison instead, and Heracles died.  He killed Megara and their children in a fit of madness sent by Hera and, consequently, was obliged to become the servant o
2 CONC f Eurystheus, the Perseid King of Greece.  He was traditionally said to be the son of Zeus and Alcmene, granddaughter of Perseus.  He was deprived of the kingdom of Mycenæ, by Hera, the jealous wife 
2 CONC of Zuen, in favor of his father's cousin Eurystheus, yet another grand-son of Perseus, who later subjected him to his famous labors.  He was born in Thebes, Greece.  His body was placed on a pyre on M
2 CONC t. Oeta (modern Greek Oiti), his mortal part consumed and his divine part ascending to heaven. There he was reconciled to Hera and married Hebe.  He was the most famous Greco-Roman legendary hero, and
2 CONC  behind his very complicated mythology, probably a real man, perhaps a chieftain-vassal of the kingdom of Argos in Greece.  Alcides was the first name of Heracles until a Pythian priestess first calle
2 CONC d him Heracles. This priestess told him to serve Eurystheus for twelve years and to perform the labours imposed on him, and when the tasks were accomplished he would become immortal.  Also called Herc

2 CONT <p>Zeus was born on Crete</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Greek mythology, Zeus was born on Crete. Two caves high in the Cretan mountains contest the honour of being known as the birthplace of the greatest god of ancient Greece: the Dikteon C
2 CONC ave in south-central Crete and the Ideon Cave on the highest mountain in Crete, Mount Ida or Psiloritis. There is no information describing exactly where Zeus was born, and each cave has its own adher
2 CONC ents. The important thing, however, is that Crete is the birthplace of Zeus, in a way which has many points of similarity to the birth of Christ, many centuries later, in another cave in what is now t
2 CONC he state of Israel. Uranus, Gaia and Cronus

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But let’s start at the beginning... According to Hesiod’s Theogony, the first gods at the beginning of the world were Uranus (the Sky) and Gaia (the Earth). Uranus, fearful of losing his power 
2 CONC to his descendants, cast his children into the depths of the earth. Gaia, who was not  keen on her husband’s behaviour, hid her son Cronus in the marriage bed and later helped him to overthrow his f
2 CONC ather. According to myth, on Gaia’s advice Cronus took a sickle and castrated Uranus, throwing his genitals into the sea. Thus was born the beautiful goddess of love Aphrodite. Cronus and Rhea, the 
2 CONC birth of Zeus on Crete

2 CONT <p>But Cronus was to share his father’s fate. Afraid of his father’s prophetic curse, he swallowed his children sothey would not be able to take his place. rhea and cronus  Rhea gives to Cronus a 
2 CONC fake baby</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cronus and Rhea had had five children before Zeus, who all ended up in their father’s stomach. When Rhea became pregnant with Zeus, she did not want him to share their fate, so she asked for the 
2 CONC help of her parents, Uranus and Gaia. Following their advice, she went to Crete and hid in a cave inthe Cretan mountains to bring forth the child in secret, unknown to her child-eating husband. As she
2 CONC  gave birth, Rhea tried to stifle her cries by sinking her fingers into the earth. From each finger arose one of the ten Dactyls, benevolent inhabitants of the Cretan mountains. Throughout the birth, 
2 CONC the entrance to the cave was guarded by the legendary Curetes, whom many myths identify with the Dactyls. As soon as Rhea gave birth to Zeus, the healthy boy who was to become the Father of the Gods o
2 CONC f Olympus, she gave him to the Curetes to look after. They danced and stamped, beat their drums and clashed their shields to cover the baby’s crying. In order to deceive her husband Cronus, Rhea gav
2 CONC e him a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead of the baby. He swallowed the supposed infant at once and relaxed once more in the certainty that his throne was not at risk from his children.

2 CONT <p>Zeus grows up hidden in the mountains of Crete</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the meantime, little Zeus was growing up in the cave where he remained hidden in the mountains of Crete. The goat Amalthea and the nymph Melissa played an important part in his upbringing. Amalt
2 CONC hea, a goat or, according to others, a nymph, suckled the holy infant and from her horn, the cornucopia or horn of plenty, came all manner of good things. The nymph Melissa nursed Zeus and looked afte

2 CONT <p>When Zeus eventually grew up and came of age, he overthrew Cronus and assumed his divine authority, either bloodlessly or after a terrible war, the Titanomachy, referred to in a different version o
2 CONC f the myth. According to the version of the Titanomachy or War of the Titans, when Zeus went to find his father and take over from him, he sliced open Cronus’s belly and out leapt all the children h
2 CONC e had swallowed in the past: Hera, Poseidon, Hestia, Demeter and Pluto (Hades). With their help, Zeus fought the Titans who controlled the universe, led by Cronus. The war was long and cruel but it wa

2 CONT <p>We all know the story of how Christ was born in a manger, with animals whose breath and bodies offered some warmth in the frozen cave, according to Orthodox tradition. But how many of us know that 
2 CONC this story is not original, but had also taken place many centuries earlier in ancient Greece, specifically on the island of Crete? According to Greek mythology, Dias or Zeus, the father of the gods o
2 CONC f Olympus, was born in a cave on Crete. No myth gives the precise location of the cave; Hesiod’s Theogony, for instance, refers to a cave near the ancient city of Lyktos in south-central Crete. This
2 CONC  led to confusion and so today there are two contenders for the title of Zeus’s birthplace: the Ideon Cave on Mount Ida or Psiloritis near the village of Anoyia, and the Dikteon Cave on Mount Dicte,
2 CONC  near the village of Psychro on the Lassithi Plateau. In both caves, excavations have brought archaeological finds to light showing that these were important cult places, but there is not enough evide
2 CONC nce to choose one of the two as the birthplace of Zeus. Similarities between the stories of Christ and Zeus

2 CONC  in Spring, following the eternal cycle of nature. Christ was crucified, died and was resurrected. From the cave of Zeus to the manger of Christ
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>birth of ChristAccording to the experts, religions evolve down the ages, adapting to new conditions. However, they always cover basic human needs, needs which do not change significantly through hi
2 CONC story. Just as our ancestors, thousands of years ago, prayed to Zeus (the Hymn to the Dictaean Zeus) for their families, their crops, their flocks and their ships, for peace and prosperity in their so
2 CONC cieties, so too do we pray to God today for exactly the same things. The only difference is that most of us are no longer farmers or shepherds, but businesspeople, employees and scientists. In Crete w
2 CONC e also have a further example of ancient practices being carried over to the new religion. When the shepherds of Mount Psiloritis accuse each other of stealing sheep, they go to the monastery of Diosk
2 CONC ourios and, before the holy icons, swear a solemn oath - not to Christ, as one would expect, but to Za (derived from the name of Zeus). Especially concerning the births of Christ and Zeus, we see coll
2 CONC ective memories and universal truths which still apply, unchanged, despite the millennia separating the two stories. Christ, according to Orthodox tradition, was born in a cave, like Zeus long before.
2 CONC  Why a cave? Perhaps because caves were the first refuges for humans, offering shelter from bad weather and wild animals. Perhaps because caves are ancient symbols of the womb, the wombs of the Earth,
2 CONC  Gaia, the Great Mother. Animals were at the side of the newborn Zeus and Christ and helped them to survive at the beginning of their lives, just as animals have helped people survive for thousands of
2 CONC  years, with their meat, milk, wool or companionship. The exercise of power by cruel rulers has led to thousands of victims in every age. Both Cronus and Herod are expressions of the bottomless human 
2 CONC thirst for power, a thirst which overcomes all law and conscience: Cronus swallowed his children alive, while Herod slaughtered all the male infants in his district. Both Zeus and Christ, in their fir
2 CONC st moments of life, faced these ruthless tyrants and were hidden in caves to survive. Just to make things clear: this article does not aim to equate Zeus with Christ. There are certainly similarities 
2 CONC in their stories, but there are even more differences, particularly in their lives and personalities. This article was not written by an expert on religions, nor is it a scientific text. These are jus
2 CONC t some simple observations whose intention is more to entertain than to teach. I hope we have managed to do so.

2 CONT <p> Zeus' grave</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Much has been written about Zeus’ grave. According to the Cretans the father of gods and people who was born in Crete was burried in the same place as well. But where is his grave? Some people lo
2 CONC ok for it in Giouchta, some others on the mountains of Lasithi and others on Mount Ida (Psiloritis). Kallinikos (or Callinicus), yet for others Epimenides of Knossos is said to have accused the Cretan
2 CONC s as being liars because they showed visitors around Zeus’ grave while he considered him immortal since he never died. As I heard by elderly people who lived between the end of 1800 until 1950-60, s
2 CONC everal Greeks but in particular foreign visitors of the village asked where was ZOU, POULOU and MAKARIA. Let us begin with ZOU. In the south-eastern side of the hill named Kefalas, opposite Nikiforian
2 CONC a or Metochi, and 100 metres west of  Amalthea’s Water, there is a cave whose roof has fallen over probably by some earthquake*.  The legend says that an old king is buried in that cave and that it 
2 CONC is full of gold. (According to Diodoros Siculos, Zeus was the first King of Crete.) This cave is called ZOU’s cave (another name for Zeus). Consequently the inhabitants of Zouliana, Zoulakkiana or Z
2 CONC oniana are entitled to claim that Zeus’ grave is situated in their territory until a further investigation on the matter is carried out and also to sing the following couplets:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Zoniana is the favourite place of Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>That is why he is still buried in its guts.</p>

2 CONT <p>* Statistics by N. Stavrakis, p. 107, “Earthquakes in Crete”: July 21, 365 BC. According to Von Hoff, ten towns were destroyed in Crete. “But if it  is true”,  says Dapper (p. 399), “that
2 CONC  in Crete there was Zeus’ grave, it becomes clear that it must have been destroyed by an earthquake which took place during the first consulship of Flavius Iulius Valens and Valentinian I in the yea
2 CONC r 360 BC during which year more than one hundred towns of this island collapsed. Lacroix adds that in 368 BC, during the time of Gratian the Great (Flavius Gratianus Augustus), a part of the island wa

2 CONT <p>Makaria</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>500 metres away from the last house in Agouriana there is a location called Makaria. The legend says that there was an ancient city, Makaria, and this is not only manifested by the legend but also 
2 CONC by the presence of more than ten, half-destroyed wine-presses with their pots, built with a special kind of lime, that is mud made by grated tile and lime. There is also a stone of 1.5 m. X 0.5 m. hav
2 CONC ing an engraved circle and at its edges two parallel holes of 0.1 m. X 0.2 m. which was probably used as a press (see picture below). In many places there are extant walls (see picture below), others 
2 CONC made by clay and others not, built with rough stones, which means that they are very old. In the “History of Crete” by V. Psilakis, Vol. 1, p. 56, footnote 1, it is cited that: Hogarth says that �
2 CONC ��the private dwellings of that time (before 2000 BC ) were modestly built with rough stones and clay and were painted on the inside with plaster”. There are also graves on that spot but I am not su
2 CONC re of which era, probably not very old ones.

2 CONT <p>Diogenis' foot </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before we reach Makaria from the old road, at the location of Gagles there is a footprint on a stone which is called ‘Diogenis foot’ or Digenis’ foot’. When I asked Fragostelis (Stylianos P
2 CONC arassiris) why it is called Digenis’ foot and he explained to me, as we will see later, I noticed that he called him Diogeni rather than Digeni and I smiled ironically because, being a high school s
2 CONC tudent at the time, I thought he pronounced it wrong. Fifty years later, while reading some book I found out that the Idaean Dactyls (or Dactyli) and the Curetes were called “D – i – o –geneis
2 CONC ”, which means that they had been created by Dias (Zeus) and the descent of Dias or something like that. It was then when I remembered my uncle Fragostelis and I thought that he should be laughing i
2 CONC ronically at me. Because as we know, Digenis was the Acritan, that is the frontiersman who pursued the Apelats from the borders of the Byzantine Empire. Here in Crete Talos, the Idaean Dactyls and the
2 CONC  Curetes, who were called Diogeneis had taken on the role of Digenis centuries before him. The legend says that Diogenis or Digenis stepped on that stone, threw away his stick and cut one of the highe
2 CONC st peaks of Koukoulonas. That is why it is called Koutsotroulis (which means without a peak).

2 CONT <p>The Island </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>An ancient town is referred to with that name. Next to Garazo there is a location with that name, which is uninhabited today, but which is said to have had six Greek Families in 1894, according to 
2 CONC the ‘Topography of Crete’ by Kalomenopoulos. In addition, Ms. Argini Frangouli has written on the same matter where she expresses the opinion –having reservations though- that maybe on that loca
2 CONC tion there had been one of the most ancient towns, Lasos, Panonia or Dion. Also in Chania there was a village with that name. Moreover, at a distance of 5-6 chilometres far away from Zoniana towards P
2 CONC siloritis there is a location called the “Island”. This name is justified in every sense since from the east and north there was once lake Roussa, today a desiccated one, from the west the river O
2 CONC axis and from the south a small tributary.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In that tributary at the location of Macha high in the middle of the steep rock there is a part of a wall which makes it difficult to explain how or why it was built. In the same area a stone cutti
2 CONC ng tool resembling an axe has been found. The place on the Island has several small pieces from earthen pots. Today it is a seat inside a mitato1 of “Bouchourides” (a common Cretan family name). T
2 CONC hat seat was used for making cheese and resting.

2 CONT <p>The Idaean Dactyls - Poulou</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to mythology the Idaean Dactyls or Dactyli used to be giants who were born on Mount Ida. That is why they are called Idaean, whose mission was to protect Zeus when he was little. There ar
2 CONC e many versions as to how and where they were born, which can be found in the “Cretan Mythology” by N. Psilakis. However, I will cite two of them which are related to our village. One of them says
2 CONC  that when Rhea was in labour to Zeus, she stack her fingers into the Earth so as not to scream and let Cronus hear her. From each of her fingers, which left their fingerprints, sprang a giant, in tot
2 CONC al ten of them, who were named Idaean because they were born on Mount Ida and also Dactyls (or Dactyli), the Greek equivalent of fingers, which derives from Rhea’s fingers. It was them who committed
2 CONC  themselves with the protection of Zeus.  The other version says that a nymph called Anchiale touched with her fingers Land Oaxia and from it sprang ten men who were called Idaean Dactyls. But what is
2 CONC  Land Oaxia?  As it is widely spread, the river Milopotamos crosses Zoniana, from which river the province took its name. The river was named Oaxis in antiquity (also Virgil mentions it, see Encyclope
2 CONC dia “HELIOS”). It starts from Psiloritis, crosses Zoniana, Diskouri, next to Garazo, Mourtzana, Perama and flows into the mouth between Panormos and Skaleta. It is nowadays called Geropotamos. Anc
2 CONC hiale touched the Land of Oaxis and this took place near Mount Ida in Zoniana. But even if we suppose that when we say Land Oaxia we mean the Earth of the ancient Oaxos (Axos), nothing really changes 
2 CONC because in antiquity the entire province of Zoniana and Anogeia belonged to the kingdom of Oaxos (or Axos). Therefore, Oaxia was also the Land of Zoniana. But now another question rises: Where did Rhe
2 CONC a stack her fingers and which are her fingerprints? One hand is surely situated at the location of Poulou. It is the place where the river Oaxis ends (Mesokourouno) and five streamlets begin to mount 
2 CONC up Psiloritis. If one happens to see them from a high place, one is given the impression that they look like an open, gigantic hand (a common Greek gesture which shows contempt or abuse) and this in t
2 CONC he Cretan dialect is called poulos, from which word derived the name of the location Poulou. These streamlets –fingerprints- belong to the Island, to Kavdelio, Zouridospilia, Pelekato and Lagoperama
2 CONC . To sum up, the Dactyls are called Idaean because the place is located on Mount Ida, Dactyls and Poulou because the streamlets look like open fingers, the river is called Oaxis – Land Oaxia consequ
2 CONC ently: this is the place where the ancient Cretans thought that Rhea had stack her hand.

2 CONT <p>At a close distance from Zou’s cave and Amalthea’s Water there is what is depicted in the picture below. What can it be?</p>
2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The God of the Sky Zeus of Greek Myth caused The Flood in the age of Deucalion 1529 B.C..1 He was born at a cave of Dicte, Crete. Both Gaia and Uranus foretold Cronos that he would be dethroned by 
2 CONC his own son. So to avoid this he used to swallow his children at birth. This enraged Rhea, who being pregnant with Zeus, went to Crete and gave him birth in a cave of Dicte. Nymphs fed the child Zeus 
2 CONC on the milk of Amalthea and the Curetes in arms guarded the child in the cave, clashing their spears on their shields in order to prevent Cronos to hear his voice. In the meantime Rhea wrapped a stone

1 NOTE Zeus 
2 CONT <p>Gudarnas och himmelsens gud, avbildad med en åskvigg eller blixt i sin hand. Zeus var den mäktigaste guden, och hade tagit makten från sin far Kronos. Zeus var en vädergud, liksom lagens, state
2 CONC ns, samhällets, stadens, familjens och främlingarnas gud.
2 CONT <p>Zeus huvudhelgedom låg i Dodona, där man trodde att man kunde höra framtiden viskas av vinden som blåste genom löven i gudens heliga ekar som växte där. I Olympia hedrades han vart fjärde �
2 CONC �r med de olympiska spelen, och Feidias staty av honom där ansågs vara en av den antika världens sju underverk.  De nemeiska spelen hölls också till hans ära. Fåglarna, särskilt örnen, ansåg
2 CONC s vara hans budbärare och därför försökte hans präster förutsäga framtiden genom att betrakta deras flykt. Berg uppkallades ofta efter Zeus, och än idag finns det Zeusberg över hela Grekland
2 CONC , till exempel på Kreta och Naxos.  På Kreta dyrkades Zeus särskilt eftersom det ansågs att han växt upp där, gömd från sin far som skulle ha ätit upp honom om han hade vetat att han existera
2 CONC de. På Kreta ansåg man att han fötts där, och också att det var där han dog. Det fanns tillochmed en grav där som sades vara hans.
2 CONT <p>Namnet Zeus anses komma ifrån det sanskritiska "dyaus" vilket betyder himmel. De antika grekerna kallade honom också Dias, och detta namn har genom latinets deus kommit att bli ett vanligt ord f�
2 CONC �r gud i många språk.  Vid sidan av att vara den högsta guden var Zeus också en stygg gud. Han var ständigt otrogen mot sin svartsjuka hustru och syster Hera, och han hade många barn både med d
2 CONC ödliga och odödliga kvinnor. Med Hera hade han Ares, Hebe, Hefaistos och Eileithyia.
2 CONT <p>I en svans skepnad hade han förfört drottning Leda av Sparta, och hon födde honon den sköna Helena och Polydeukes. I ens tjurs skepnad borförde han den feniciska prinsessan Europa, och hon fö
2 CONC dde honom Minos och Rhadamanhus.  Med minnes gudinna Mnemosyne blev han de nio musernas far, och med andra gudinnor och dödliga kvinnor hade han Apollon, Artemis, Dionysos och Herakles.  Zeus var ock
2 CONC så den ende föräldern till Athena, vars märkvärdiga födsel skedde efter att han haft en fruktansvärd huvudvärk. Hefaistos drämde en slägga i hans huvud, och ur sprang gudinnan fullvuxen och 
2 CONC i rustning.  Inte bara kvinnor var hans offer. Den unge rojanske prins Ganymedes borfördes av Zeus och togs till Olympen där han blev gudarnas tjänare. 
2 CONT <p>I Rom dyrkades Zeus under namnet Jupiter.</p>

2 CONT <p>Prehistory</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus is the continuation of Dyeus, the supreme god in Indo-European religion, also continued as Vedic Dyaus Pitar (cf. Jupiter), and as Tyr (Ziu, Tiw, Tiwaz) in Germanic and Norse mythology. Tyr wa
2 CONC s however supplanted by Odin as the supreme god among the Germanic tribes and they did not identify Zeus/Jupiter with either Tyr or Odin, but with Thor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In addition to his Indo-European inheritance, the classical Zeus also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient Near East, such as the scepter.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Role and epithets</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus played a huge role in the Greek Olympic pantheon. He fathered many of the heroes and heroines (see list at bottom of article) and was featured in many of their stories. Though he was the god o
2 CONC f the sky and thunder, he was also the most supreme cultural artifact; in some senses, he was the embodiment of Greek religious beliefs and the archetypal Greek deity.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The epithets or titles applied to Zeus emphasized different aspects of his wide-ranging authority:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Olympios emphasized Zeus's kingship over both the gods and the Panhellenic festival at Olympia. </p>
2 CONT <p>A related title was Panhellenios, ('Zeus of all the Hellenes') to whom Aeacus' famous temple on Aegina was dedicated. </p>
2 CONT <p>As Xenios, Zeus was the patron of hospitality and guests, ready to avenge any wrong done to a stranger. </p>
2 CONT <p>As Horkios, he was the keeper of oaths. Liars who were exposed were made to dedicate a statue to Zeus, often at the sanctuary of Olympia. </p>
2 CONT <p>As Agoraios, Zeus watched over business at the agora, and punished dishonest traders. </p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Panhellenic cults of Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>The major center at which all Greeks converged to pay honor to their chief god was Olympia. The quadrennial festival there featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of sto
2 CONC ne, but of ash - from the accumulated remains of many centuries' worth of animal victims immolated there.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Outside of the major inter-polis sanctuaries, there were certain modes of worshipping Zeus that were shared across the Greek world. Most of the above titles, for instance, could be found at any num
2 CONC ber of Greek temples from Asia Minor to Sicily. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the other hand, certain cities had Zeus-cults that operated in markedly different ways.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Some local Zeus-cults</p>
2 CONT <p>In addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men. A few examples are listed below.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Cretan Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>On Crete, Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at Knossos, Ida and Palaikastro. The stories of Minos and Epimenides suggest that these caves were once used for incubatory divination by kings an
2 CONC d priests. The dramatic setting of Plato's Laws is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a
2 CONC  mature adult, and hymned as ho megas kouros "the great youth". With the Kouretes, a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cr
2 CONC etan paideia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Hellenistic writer Euhemerus apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of Crete and that posthumously his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhe
2 CONC merism have not survived, but Christian patristic writers took up the suggestion with enthusiasm.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus Lykaios in Arcadia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laconian kylix of the 6th century BC, showing Zeus Lykaios with an eagle.The title Lykaios is morphologically connected to lyke "brightness", and yet it looks a lot like lykos "wolf". This semantic
2 CONC  ambiguity is reflected in the strange cult of Zeus Lykaios in the backwoods of Arcadia, where the god takes on both lucent and lupine features. On the one hand, he presides over Mt Lykaion ("the brig
2 CONC ht mountain") the tallest peak in Arcadia, and home to a precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast (Pausanias 8.38). On the other hand, he is connected with Lycaon ("the wolf-man") whose
2 CONC  ancient cannibalism was commemorated with bizarre, recurring rites. According to Plato (Republic 565d-e), a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every eight years to Zeus 
2 CONC Lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal's. Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat aga
2 CONC in of human flesh until the next eight-year cycle had ended.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Subterranean Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>Although etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored Zeuses who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored Zeus Meilichios ("kindly" or "honeyed") whil
2 CONC e other cities had Zeus Chthonios ("earthy"), Katachthonios ("under-the-earth) and Plousios ("wealth-bringing"). These deities might be represented indifferently as snakes or men in visual art. They a
2 CONC lso received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did chthonic deities like Persephone and Demeter, and also the heroes at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually
2 CONC  received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the daimon to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in Boeotia might belong to the hero Trophonius
2 CONC  or to Zeus Trephonius ("the nurturing"), depending on whether you believe Pausanias or Strabo. The hero Amphiaraus was honored as Zeus Amphiaraus at Oropus outside of Thebes, and the Spartans even ha
2 CONC d a shrine to Zeus Agamemnon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Oracles of Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>Although most oracle sites were usually dedicated to Apollo, the heroes, or various or goddesses like Themis, a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>The Oracle at Dodona</p>
2 CONT <p>The cult of Zeus at Dodona in Epirus, where there is evidence of religious activity from the 2nd millennium BC onward, centered around a sacred oak. When the Odyssey was composed (circa 750 BC), di
2 CONC vination was done there by barefoot priests called Selloi, who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches (Od. 14.326-7). By the time Herodotus wrote about Dodona, female p
2 CONC riestesses called peleiades ("doves") had replaced the male priests.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus' wife at Dodona was not Hera, but the goddess Dione — whose name is a feminine form of "Zeus". Her status as a titaness suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic d
2 CONC eity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle..
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>The Oracle at Siwa</p>
2 CONT <p>The oracle of Ammon at the oasis of Siwa in Egypt did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before Alexander's day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: Hero
2 CONC dotus mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the Persian War. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at Sparta, where a temple to him existed by the time of the Peloponnesian War (Pausani
2 CONC as 3.18).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Other oracles of Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>The chthonic Zeuses (or heroes) Trophonius and Amphiaraus were both said to give oracles at the cult-sites.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus and foreign gods</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus was equivalent to the Roman god Jupiter (from Jovis Pater or "Father Jove") and associated in the syncretic classical imagination with various other deities, such as the Egyptian Ammon and the
2 CONC  Etruscan Tinia. He (along with Dionysus) absorbed the role of the chief Phrygian god Sabazios in the syncretic deity known in Rome as Sabazius.

2 CONT <p>Birth</p>
2 CONT <p>Cronus sired several children by Rhea: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, but swallowed them all as soon as they were born, since he had learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be
2 CONC  overcome by his own son as he had overthrown his own father. But when Zeus was about to be born, Rhea sought Uranus and Gaia to devise a plan to save him, so that Cronus would get his retribution for
2 CONC  his acts against Uranus and his own children. Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Crete, handing Cronus a rock wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he promptly swallowed.

2 CONT <p>Childhood</p>
2 CONT <p>Rhea hid Zeus in a cave on Mount Ida in Crete. According to varying versions of the story:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was then raised by Gaia. </p>
2 CONT <p>He was raised by a goat named Amalthea, while a company of Kouretes, soldiers, or smaller gods danced, shouted and clapped their hands to make noise so that Cronus would not hear the baby's cry. (S
2 CONC ee cornucopia.) </p>
2 CONT <p>He was raised by a nymph named Adamanthea. Since Cronus ruled over the Earth, the heavens and the sea, she hid him by dangling him on a rope from a tree so he was suspended between earth, sea and s
2 CONC ky and thus, invisible to his father. 
2 CONT <p>He was raised by a nymph named Cynosura. In gratitude, Zeus placed her among the stars after her death. </p>
2 CONT <p>He was raised by Melissa, who nursed him with goat-milk </p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus becomes king of the gods</p>
2 CONT <p>After reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to disgorge the other children in reverse order of swallowing: first the stone, which was set down at Pytho under the glens of Parnassus to be a sign to m
2 CONC ortal men, then the rest. In some versions, Metis gave Cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus' stomach open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the Gigantes, 
2 CONC the Hecatonchires and the Cyclopes, from their dungeon in Tartarus (The Titans; he killed their guard, Campe. As gratitude, the Cyclopes gave him thunder and the thunderbolt, or lightning, which had p
2 CONC reviously been hidden by Gaia.) Together, Zeus and his brothers and sisters, along with the Gigantes, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans. The Titans were then cast into a
2 CONC  shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, Poseidon and Hades, by drawing lots: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead 
2 CONC (the underworld). Land was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the "earth-shaker" (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans that died. 
2 CONC (See also: Penthus)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gaia was upset at the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of Gaia's other children, the monster
2 CONC s Typhon and Echidna. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under a mountain, but left Echidna and her children alive as challenges for future heroes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus and Hera</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus was brother and consort of Hera. The issue of their union was Ares, though Hera produced other offspring of her own: Hephaistos, Eileithyia, Hebe. The conquests of Zeus among nymphs and the my
2 CONC thic mortal progenitors of Hellenic dynasties are famous. Olympian mythography even credits him with unions with Demeter, Latona, Dione and Maia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Among the mortals: Semele, Io, Europa and Leda. For more details, see below).</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mythic anecdote renders Hera as jealous of his amorous conquests and a consistent enemy of Zeus' mistresses and their children by him. For a time, a nymph named Echo had the job of distracting Hera
2 CONC  from his affairs by incessantly talking: when Hera discovered the deception, she cursed Echo to repeat the words of others.

2 CONT <p>Zeus miscellany</p>
2 CONT <p>Though Zeus could be petty and malicious, he also had a righteous streak, perhaps best exemplified in his aid on behalf of Atreus and his murder of Capaneus for unbridled arrogance. He was also the
2 CONC  protector of strangers and travelers against those who might seek to victimize them. 
2 CONT <p>Zeus turned Pandareus to stone for stealing a bronze dog from one of his temples on Crete. </p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus killed Salmoneus with a thunderbolt for attempting to equal him, riding around on a bronze chariot and loudly imitating thunder. </p>
2 CONT <p>As a child, Zeus had had a friend named Celmis. Many years later, Rhea became offended by the antics of Celmis and asked Zeus to turn him into a lump of steel or diamond. Zeus obliged. </p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus turned Periphas into an eagle after his death, as a reward for being righteous and just. </p>
2 CONT <p>At the marriage of Zeus and Hera, a nymph named Chelone was disrespectful (or refused to attend). Zeus condemned her to eternal silence. </p>
2 CONT <p>When Memnon died, Zeus felt pity for his mother, Eos, the dawn-goddess, and granted him immortality. </p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus made the decision to marry Aphrodite off to Hephaestus in order to prevent violence over her between the many gods who lusted after the goddess of beauty. </p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus, with Hera, turned King Haemus and Queen Rhodope into mountains (Balkan and Despoto, respectively) for their vanity. </p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus exchanged a caduceus for the first flute with Hermes. </p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus turned Atalanta and Hippomenes (or Melanion) into lions because they had sex in one of his temples. </p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus blinded Tiresias but also gave him the gift of prophecy (though according to some versions of the story, it was actually Hera who did the blinding). </p>
2 CONT <p>Today the phrase "by Jove" is still sometimes used in the United Kingdom. The comedian Ken Dodd uses the phrase "By Jove, missus". </p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus punished Hera by dangling her by her toes from the sky. </p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus in Neopaganism</p>
2 CONT <p>Far from the role Zeus held in Ancient Mythology, modern Neopagans typically view Zeus as a governing figurehead and little more. Most neopagans reject ancient myths about Zeus. Zeus has relatively
2 CONC  few worshippers in modern neopaganism, and (unlike his roles in Mythology) is seen as a god of governance and authority. Though many see Zeus as the King or Figurehead as ruler over the Olympians, th
2 CONC ey often consider him of lesser importance than the Gaia and other popular Titan gods who are not believed to be bound to Tartarus. The power and influence of Zeus is thought to pale in importance to 
2 CONC Hades and other gods more directly related to the afterlife. It is thought by many Neopagans, for example, that Hades holds far greater power than Zeus, and that his decisions and authority, particula
2 CONC rly over the fate of mortals, often overshadows Zeus. Those sects that do include worship of Zeus often do so in passing, including him with other gods simply because of his relation in mythology. The
2 CONC re is little relevance between actual mythology and modern perceptions of Zeus by most Neopagans. It could be argued that, by and large, modern Neopagan perceptions of Zeus are New Age and not founded
2 CONC  in any actual history or mythology. Worship of Zeus sometimes includes the burning of oils, or more often a passing utterance of him as an authority of Olympus or husband of Hera (a more popular deit
2 CONC y in modern neopaganism).

2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>Deusa Titã</p>
2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>Rhea (ancient Greek Ῥέα) was the Titaness daughter of Uranus, the sky, and Gaia, the earth, in classical Greek mythology. In earlier traditions, she was strongly associated with Gaia and Cybele
2 CONC , the Great Goddess and later seen by the classical Greeks as the mother of the major gods and goddesses. She became sister to Cronus and mother to Demeter, Hades, Hera, Hestia, Poseidon, and Zeus. In
2 CONC  Roman mythology, she was Magna Mater deorum Idaea and identified with Opis or, Ops.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In art, Rhea is usually depicted on a chariot drawn by two lions, and is not always distinguishable from Cybele.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cronus, Rhea's Titan brother and, later, husband, castrated their father, Uranus. After this, Cronus re-imprisoned the Hecatonchires, the Gigantes and the Cyclopes and set the monster Campe to guar
2 CONC d them. He and Rhea took the throne as King and Queen of the gods. This time was called the Golden Age.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cronus sired several children by Rhea: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, but swallowed them all as soon as they were born, since he had learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be
2 CONC  overcome by his own child as he had overthrown his own father. But when Zeus was about to be born, Rhea sought Uranus and Gaia to devise a plan to save him, so that Cronus would get his retribution f
2 CONC or his acts against Uranus and his own children. Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Crete, handing Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes which he promptly swallowed.
1 NOTE En la mitología griega, la titánide Rea (en griego antiguo Ῥεία Reia, Ῥέα Rea, Ῥείη Reiē o Ῥέη Reē, ‘flujo menstrual o del líquido amniótico’ o ‘facilidad enel parto’) 
2 CONC era hija de Urano y Gea, hermana y esposa de Crono, y madre con éste de Demét
2 CONT <p>er, Hades, Hera, Hestia, Poseidón y Zeus. Estaba fuertemente asociada a Cibeles, tanto que en obras de arte solía ser representada en un carro tirado por dos leones, y no siempre era posible dist
2 CONC inguirlas. En la mitología romana, fue la Magna Mat
2 CONT <p>er deorum Idaea y se le identificaba con Ops. Según Hesíodo fue nodriza de Dioniso.1 En la Antología Palatina se la menciona como nodriza de fieras y leones.2</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tras derrotar a Urano, su padre, Crono volvió a encarcelar a los Hecatónquiros, los Gigantes y los Cíclopes en el Tártaro, y dejó al monstruo Campe de carcelera. Él y Rea subieron al trono co
2 CONC mo reyes de los dioses. Esta época se denominó la edad
2 CONT <p> dorada, pues la gente de entonces no necesitaba leyes ni reglas: todos hacían lo correcto, por lo que no eran necesarias.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Crono fue padre de varios hijos de Rea: Hestia, Deméter, Hera, Hades y Poseidón, pero se los tragó tan pronto como nacieron, pues Gea y Urano le habían revelado que estaba destinado a serderroc
2 CONC ado por su propio hijo, tal como él había destronado
2 CONT <p> a su padre. Sin embargo, cuando Zeus estaba a punto de nacer, Rea pidió consejo a Urano y Gea para urdir un plan que le salvara, y así Crono tuviera el justo castigo a sus actos contra Urano y c
2 CONC ontra sus propios hijos. Rea se escondió en la isla
2 CONT <p> de Creta, donde dio a luz a Zeus. Luego engañó a Crono, dándole una piedra envuelta en pañales que éste tragó en seguida sin desconfiar.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Entonces escondió a Zeus en una cueva del monte Ida en Creta. De acuerdo a diversas versiones de esta historia, Zeus fue criado:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>   1. Por Gea.</p>
2 CONT <p>   2. Por una cabra llamada Amaltea, mientras una compañía de soldados llamados Curetes o Coribantes, o algunos dioses menores, bailaban, gritaban y daban palmadas para hacer ruido y que Crono no
2 CONC  oyese los llantos del niño.</p>
2 CONT <p>   3. Por una ninfa llamada Adamantea. Puesto que Crono gobernaba la tierra, los cielos y el mar, ella le escondió colgándole con una cuerda de un árbol, de forma que quedaba suspendido entre la
2 CONC  tierra, el mar y el cielo, siendo pues invisible a
2 CONT <p> su padre.</p>
2 CONT <p>   4. Por una ninfa llamada Cinosura. En agradecimiento, Zeus la subió entre las estrellas tras su muerte.</p>
2 CONT <p>   5. Por Melisa, quien lo alimentó con leche de cabra.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tras hacerse adulto, Zeus obligó a Crono a regurgitar a sus otros hijos en orden inverso al que los había tragado: primero la piedra, que se le dejó a Pitón bajo las cañadas del Parnaso como s
2 CONC eñal a los hombres mortales, y después al resto. En al
2 CONT <p>gunas versiones, Metis le dio a Crono un emético para obligarle a vomitar los bebés, y en otras Zeus abrió el estómago de Crono. Entonces Zeus liberó a los hermanos de Crono, los Gigantes, los
2 CONC  Hecatónquiros y los Cíclopes, de su mazmorra en el Tá
2 CONT <p>rtaro y mató a su guardiana, Campe. En agradecimiento, los Cíclopes le dieron el trueno, el rayo y el relámpago, que habían sido previamente escondidos por Gea. En una guerra llamada la Titanom
2 CONC aquia, Zeus y sus hermanos y hermanas junto con los G
2 CONT <p>igantes, Hecatónquiros y Cíclopes, derrocaron a Crono y a los otros Titanes, que fueron encerrados en el Tártaro, un lugar húmedo, lúgubre, frío y neblinoso en los más profundo de la Tierra.
2 CONC  Irónicamente, Zeus también encarceló allí a los Hecatón
2 CONT <p>quiros y los Cíclopes.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Según Homero Rea es la madre de los dioses, si bien no una madre universal como Cibeles, la Gran Madre frigia, con quien más tarde se le identifica. Su lugar original de culto estaba en Creta. Al
2 CONC lí, cuenta la leyenda, salvó al recién nacido Zeus,
2 CONT <p> su sexto hijo, de ser devorado por Crono, al darle en su lugar una piedra, y lo confió al cuidado de sus guardas, los Coribantes. Estos guardias se convertirían más tarde en escoltas de Zeus y 
2 CONC sacerdotes de Rea, celebrando ceremonias en su honor
2 CONT <p>. En tiempos históricos la semejanza de Rea y la Gran Madre asiática, Cibeles Frigia, era tan evidente que los griegos resolvieron el asunto considerando a esta última como su única Rea, que ha
2 CONC bía abandonado su hogar original en Creta y huido a l
2 CONT <p>as tierras inexploradas de Asia Menor para escapar de la persecución de Crono.3 También hubo una versión opuesta,4 y es probablemente cierto que los contactos culturales con el continentetrajera
2 CONC n a Creta el culto de la Gran Madre asiática, quien
2 CONT <p> se convertiría en la Rea cretense.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En la mitología griega, el símbolo de Rea es la luna. Sin embargo, en la romana su símbolo se conocía como el lunar. También tenía otros: el cisne, por ser un animal delicado, y dos leones, s
2 CONC upuestamente los que tiraban de su carro.

1 NOTE He was one of the 12 Titans and the youngest son of Uranus and Gaea, the personifications of heaven and earth. The first sons of his parents were te three Hecatonchires, the 100-handed, 50-headed mons
2 CONC ters whom Uranus had imprisoned in a secret place. Gaea sought to rescue them and appealed for help from her other offspring, including the Cyclopses. Cronus alone accepted the challenge. He attacked 
2 CONC Uranus and wounded him severely; Cronus thus became the ruler of the universe.
2 CONT <p>Cronus had been warned that he would be overthrown by one of his children, and he swallowed each of his first five children as soon as it was born. Rhea, however, substituted a stone wrapped in swa
2 CONC ddling clothes for their sixth child, Zeus. Zeus was hidden in Crete, and when he was grown, with the aid of Gaea, forced Cronus to disgorge the other five children together with the stone. The stone 
2 CONC was later removed to Delphi. Zeus and his five brothers and sisters waged war on Cronus and the other Titans. Zeus was aided by the Hecatonchires and the Cyclopses, whom he freed from the prison where
2 CONC  they were kept by Cronus. Cronus and the Titans were thereafter confined inTartarus, a cave in the deepest part of the underworld.
2 CONT <p>The Roman counterpart of Cronus is Saturn, the god of sowing and seed. Earth, and some of the children of the 12. Often called the Elder Gods,they were for many ages the supreme rulers of the unive

2 CONC  the dawn; Iapetus, the father of Prometheus, who created mortals; and Atlas, who carried the world on hisshoulders. Of all the Titans only Prometheus and Oceanus sided with Zeus against Cronus. As a 
2 CONC result, they were honored and the others were bound in Tartarus. Eventually, however, Zeus was reconciled with the Titans, and Cronus was made ruler of the Golden Age."Titans," Microsoft (R)Encarta. C

2 CONT <p>Dans la mythologie grecque, Cronos (en grec ancien Κρόνος / Krónos), fils d'Ouranos (le Ciel) et Gaïa (la Terre), est le roi des Titans et le père de Zeus. Il est souvent confondu avec son

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Fils d'Ouranos (le Ciel) et Gaïa (la Terre), Cronos appartient à la première génération des dieux ; il est le plus jeune des Titans, les douze enfants divins possédant une apparence normale1.
2 CONC </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Homère et Hésiode2 le nomment « le dieu aux pensées fourbes3 » ou « à l'esprit retors4 » (ἀγκυλομήτης / ankulomētēs, littéralement « recourbé »), terme qui s'applique peut
2 CONC -être originellement à sa faux5. Hésiode ajoute qu'il hait son père, lequel voue les mêmes sentiments à ses enfants, sans que l'on sache si cela s'applique seulement à ses enfants difformes —
2 CONC  les Cyclopes et les Hécatonchires — ou à l'ensemble de sa progéniture6. Dès leur naissance, il les emprisonne dans le sein de leur mère. Furieuse, Gaïa fabrique une faucille en acier et deman
2 CONC de à ses enfants de l'aider à se venger, mais seul Cronos répond à l'appel7. Placé en embuscade, il attaque Ouranos alors que celui-ci vient se coucher avec Gaïa, et de sa faux, lui tranche les 
2 CONC testicules, qu'il jette à la mer. Ouranos leur donne alors le nom de « Titans » parce que, précise Hésiode, ils ont tendu le bras trop haut et parce que l'avenir saura en tirer vengeance8. Ourano
2 CONC s et Gaïa avertissent également Cronos qu'il sera détrôné à son tour par son propre fils9.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hésiode n'indique pas que Cronos assume le pouvoir à la mort de son père, même s'il mentionne par ailleurs qu'il règne parmi les Immortels10. En revanche, des sources plus tardives indiquent q
2 CONC u'une fois libérés, les Titans accordent le trône à leur frère, dont la première mesure est de jeter dans les profondeurs du Tartare ses frères difformes, les Cyclopes et les Hécatonchires11.

2 CONT <p>Cronos épouse sa sœur Rhéa. N'oubliant pas la prophétie de ses parents, il dévore chacun de ses enfants au fur et à mesure qu'ils naissent : Hestia, Déméter et Héra, puis Hadès et Poséid
2 CONC on sont ainsi avalées par Cronos12. Lorsque arrive le sixième, Rhéa, sur le conseil de sa mère Gaïa, cache l'enfant en Crète et le remplace par une pierre que Cronos engloutit directement13.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>L'enfant ainsi épargné est Zeus. Il grandit loin de ses parents, et une fois parvenu à l'âge adulte, veut libérer ses frères et sœurs. Avec Gaïa, il s'arrange pour les faire recracher à so

2 CONC ngurgité jusque là, y compris la pierre qui l'a abusé, que Zeus place ensuite à Delphes15. Une variante orphique veut que, sur suggestion de Nyx, Cronos ait été drogué avec du miel, attaché pu
2 CONC is castré à son tour16. En tout état de cause, il finit jeté dans le Tartare, tandis que Zeus, Déméter, Hestia, Héra, Poséidon et Hadès gagnent les cimes du mont Olympe.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus libère les Hécatonchires et les Cyclopes du Tartare et, en récompense, reçoit de ces derniers le trait de foudre, qui lui sert à vaincre les Titans17. Dans une version plus ancienne du te
2 CONC xte d'Hésiode, les Hécatonchires repoussent les Titans jusqu'aux tréfonds de la Terre, où ils les enchaînent. Cronos partage le sort des vaincus au Tartare18. Dans une autre œuvre d'Hésiode, le
2 CONC s Travaux et les Jours, on apprend que Zeus accorde aux héros de vivre dans les îles des Bienheureux, aux confins de la Terre ; un vers interpolé ajoute qu'ils séjournent « loin des Immortels, et
2 CONC  Cronos est leur roi19 ». Un autre passage interpolé ajoute : « car le père des dieux et des hommes a dénoué ses liens, et aux héros fixés au bout du monde octroyé honneur et gloire20 ».
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Amours et postérité</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Initialement limitée aux six premiers Olympiens, la postérité de Cronos devait s'étoffer chez les auteurs récents.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ainsi, le poète crétois Épiménide, fait-il naître Aphrodite, les Moires et les Euménides de ses amours avec Evonymé, tandis qu'une tradition isolée lui attribue la paternité des Dactyles p
2 CONC ar la muse Calliope. Les Hymnes orphiques lui reconnaissent également celle du dieu phrygien Sabazios et divers scholiastes lui donnent encore pour fille la nymphe Plouto, amante de Zeus et mère de 
2 CONC Tantale. Enfin, Eustathius lui reconnaît un septième enfant par Rhéa en la personne du dieu guerrier Ényalios, plus généralement considéré comme un fils d'Arès (voire comme un simple surnom d
2 CONC e ce dernier).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Le Catalogue des femmes attribué à Hésiode fait état de son adultère avec l'Océanide Philyra. Surpris par Rhéa, Cronos se métamorphosa aussitôt en cheval, aussi Philyra, le terme venu, don
2 CONC na-t-elle naissance sur le Mont des Tilleuls au Centaure Chiron (motif notamment repris par le pseudo-Apollodore, Apollonios de Rhodes, Ovide et Hygin). De Cronos et de Philyra naquirent encore Dolops
2 CONC 21 et le roi de Libye Aphros, ancêtre des peuples carthaginois et libyens22.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>À cette liste viennent encore s'ajouter les enfants attribués à Cronos par les traditions à caractère évhémériste. Ainsi, Philon de Byblos, dans son Histoire des Ouranides, prétend qu'ayan
2 CONC t épousé Rhéa, Cronos aurait simultanément pris pour maîtresses deux de ses sœurs de cette dernière, Dioné et Aphrodite ou Astarté, puis engendré avec cette dernière Pothos, l'un des dieux 
2 CONC de l'Amour.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dans la tradition orphique </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>La tradition orphique présente un personnage assez différent de celui de la tradition hésiodique, assimilé à la divinité du temps Chronos. Dans la version la plus ancienne, Cronos fait partie
2 CONC , avec Ouranos, Zeus et sans doute Dionysos, des quatre divinités primordiales issues de Nyx, la nuit. Dans le Timée de Platon, Cronos y est le fils de d'Océan et de Téthys, eux-mêmes enfants d'O
2 CONC uranos et Gaïa23. Dans les Rhapsodies orphiques, plus récentes, Phanès ou Métis émerge le premier et règne sur le monde ; Nyx lui succède, puis Ouranos, puis Cronos. Celui-ci a la souveraineté
2 CONC  à la fois sur le ciel et la terre ; son règne correspond à l'Âge d'or.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Culte</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cronos occupe une place faible dans le culte. Des fêtes lui sont consacrées à Athènes, les Kronia, qui voient un renversement de l'ordre social. Les esclaves sont invités par leurs maîtres à
2 CONC  un banquet et peuvent faire la fête à travers toute la cité. Dans les cités ioniennes, Cronos donne son nom à un mois, le Kronion, équivalent du Scirophorion attique.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Plusieurs étymologies ont été suggérées, notamment « l'Avaleur »24, mais sans rencontrer de consensus25. Dès l'Antiquité, on rapproche son nom de l'homophone Chronos (grec Χρόνος / K
2 CONC hrónos, mais cette étymologie populaire ne repose sur aucune base linguistique25.

2 CONT <p>En los antiguos mitos griegos, Crono envidiaba el poder de su padre y gobernante del universo, Urano. Éste se había ganado la enemistad de Gea, madre de Crono y los demás Titanes, cuando escondi
2 CONC ó a sus hijos menores, los Cíclopes, gigantes de un

2 CONC encerles de que matasen a Urano. Sólo Crono estuvo di
2 CONT <p>spuesto a cumplir sus deseos, así que Gea le dio la hoz y le hizo tender una emboscada. Cuando Urano se encontró con Gea, Crono le atacó con la hoz y le castró. De la sangre (o, según algunas 
2 CONC pocas fuentes, del semen) que salpicó en la Tierra, su
2 CONT <p>rgieron los Gigantes, las Erinias y las Melias (ninfas de los fresnos). Crono arrojó al mar la hoz (que dio origen a la isla de Corfú) y el miembro amputado de Urano, que produjo una espuma de la
2 CONC  que nacería Afrodita. Por esto, Urano juró venganz
2 CONT <p>a y llamó a sus hijos titenes (‘los que abusan’) por exceder sus límites y osar cometer tal acto, lo que supone la fuente del nombre Titán.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En una versión alternativa, un Crono más benévolo derrocó a Ofión, el malvado Titán serpiente. Al hacerlo liberó al mundo de su esclavitud y por un tiempo gobernó justamente.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tras derrotar a Urano, Crono volvió a encerrar en el Tártaro a los Hecatónquiros y los Cíclopes, a quienes temía, y los dejó bajo la custodia de la monstruosa carcelera Campe. Subió al trono
2 CONC  junto a su hermana Rea como reyes de los dioses. Esta é
2 CONT <p>poca del reinado de Crono se denominó la edad dorada, pues la gente de entonces no necesitaba leyes ni reglas: todos hacían lo correcto y no existía la inmoralidad.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Crono supo de Gea y Urano, poseedores del conocimiento del porvenir, que estaba destinado a ser derrocado por uno de sus propios hijos. Por ello, aunque fue padre con Rea de los dioses Deméter, He
2 CONC ra, Hades y Hestia, se los tragaba tan pronto como
2 CONT <p> nacían para evitar que la profecía se cumpliese. Finalmente, cuando iban a nacer su quinto y sexto hijos, Poseidón y Zeus, Rea pidió a Gea que urdiese un plan para salvarlos y que así finalme
2 CONC nte Crono tuviese el justo castigo a sus actos contra
2 CONT <p> su padre y sus propios hijos. Rea dio a luz en secreto a Zeus en la isla de Creta y entregó a Crono una piedra envuelta en pañales, también conocida como Ónfalos, que éste tragó en seguida s
2 CONC in desconfiar creyendo que era su hijo. Lo mismo ocurri
2 CONT <p>ó con Poseidón, tragando Crono un potro en su lugar.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Algunas versiones (Pausanias viii.8.2) cuentan que Crono no tragó a Poseidón, sino que Rea le ocultó del mismo modo que a Zeus, dando a su hermano un caballo en lugar de una piedra para que lo t
2 CONC ragase.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Rea mantuvo oculto a Zeus en una cueva del monte Ida en Creta. Según diversas versiones de esta historia, Zeus fue criado:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    * Por una cabra llamada Amaltea, mientras una compañía de Curetes o Coribantes, bailarines armados, gritaban y daban palmadas para hacer ruido y que así Crono no oyese los llantos delniño.<
2 CONC /p>
2 CONT <p>    * Por una ninfa llamada Adamantea, que escondió al niño colgándolo con una cuerda de un árbol de forma que quedara suspendido entre la tierra, el mar y el cielo, sobre los que gobernaba su

2 CONT <p>    * Por su abuela Gea.</p>
2 CONT <p>    * Por una ninfa llamada Cinosura, a quien en agradecimiento Zeus subió entre las estrellas tras su muerte.</p>
2 CONT <p>    * Por Melisa, quien lo alimentó con leche de cabra.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cuando hubo crecido, Zeus usó un veneno que le dio Gea para obligar a Crono a vomitar el contenido de su estómago en orden inverso: primero la piedra, que se le dejó a Pitón bajo las cañadas d
2 CONC el Parnaso como señal a los hombres mortales, y despué

2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus (pronounced /ˈjʊərənəs, jʊˈreɪnəs/) is the Latinized form of Ouranos (Οὐρανός), the Greek word for sky. In Greek mythology Ouranos or Father Sky, is personified as the son a
2 CONC nd husband of Gaia, Mother Earth (Hesiod, Theogony). Uranus and Gaia were ancestors of most of the Greek gods, but no cult addressed directly to Uranus survived into Classical times,[1] and Uranus doe
2 CONC s not appear among the usual themes of Greek painted pottery. Elemental Earth, Sky and Styx might be joined, however, in a solemn invocation in Homeric epic.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Most Greeks considered Uranus to be primordial (protogenos), and gave him no parentage. Under the influence of the philosophers, Cicero, in De Natura Deorum ("The Nature of the Gods"), claims that 
2 CONC he was the offspring of the ancient gods Aether and Hemera, Air and Day. According to the Orphic Hymns, Ouranos was the son of the personification of night, Nyx. His equivalent in Roman mythology was 
2 CONC Caelus, likewise from caelum the Latin word for "sky".

2 CONT <p>Uranus, also known as Ouranos, was the embodiment of the sky or heavens, and known as the god of the sky. He was the first son of Gaia (the earth) and he also became her husband. According to Hesio
2 CONC d, their children included the Titans: six sons (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus and Cronus) and six daughters (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe and Tethys). There were other offspring:
2 CONC  the Cyclopes, (who were named Brontes, Steropes and Arges and were later known as "one eyed giants"), and also the three monsters known as the Hecatonchires, who each had one hundred hands and fifty 
2 CONC heads. Their names were Briareus, Cottus and Gyes. Other offspring of Uranus and Gaia were the Erinyes, who were spirits of punishment and goddesses of vengeance. The Erinyes avenged wrongs which were
2 CONC  done to family, especially murder within a family. After Uranus had been castrated, his blood fell to earth (Gaia) and conceived the Giants. These were of monstrous appearance and had great strength.
2 CONC  Similiarly, in some versions Aphrodite is believed to have risen from the foam created by the sex organs of Uranus after they were thrown into the sea by his son Cronus. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus was aghast by the sight of his offspring, the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires. (In a differing version Uranus was frightened of their great strength and the fact that they could easily depos
2 CONC e him). He hid them away in Tartarus (the bowels of the earth) inside Gaia, causing her intense pain. The discomfort became so great that she asked her youngest son, Cronus, to castrate his father, as
2 CONC  this would cease his fertility and put an end to more monstrous offspring. To accomplish this deed Gaia made an adamantine sickle, which she gave to Cronus. That night Uranus came to lay with Gaia. A
2 CONC nd as the sky god drew close, Cronus struck with the sickle and cut off Uranus's genitals. From the blood that fell from the open wound were born nymphs and giants, and when Cronus threw the severed g
2 CONC enitals into the sea a white foam appeared. From this foam Aphrodite the goddess of love and desire was born. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A slightly differing version tells of Uranus being so vast that he could cover Mother Earth (Gaia) and easily take advantage of her fruitfulness, but Gaia tired of her exuberant fertility and begge
2 CONC d her sons to free her from the excessive embrace of Uranus. All refused except Cronus. Armed with a sickle he castrated Uranus, and the blood which fell from the mutilation gave birth to the Erinyes 
2 CONC (Furies), the Giants and the Meliae (Nymphs of the manna ash trees). And when Cronus threw the sickle into the sea the island of Corfu, home of the Phaeacians, sprang up). 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Uranus (the sky) had been emasculated, the sky separated from Gaia (the earth) and Cronus became king of the gods. Later, Zeus (the son of Cronus) deposed his father and became the supreme go
2 CONC d of the Greek Pantheon.</p>

2 CONT <p>Uranus, also known as Ouranos, was the embodiment of the sky or heavens, and known as the god of the sky. He was the first son of Gaia (the earth) and he also became her husband. According to Hesio
2 CONC d, their children included the Titans: six sons (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus and Cronus) and six daughters (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe and Tethys). There were other offspring:
2 CONC  the Cyclopes, (who were named Brontes, Steropes and Arges and were later known as "one eyed giants"), and also the three monsters known as the Hecatonchires, who each had one hundred hands and fifty 
2 CONC heads. Their names were Briareus, Cottus and Gyes. Other offspring of Uranus and Gaia were the Erinyes, who were spirits of punishment and goddesses of vengeance. The Erinyes avenged wrongs which were
2 CONC  done to family, especially murder within a family. After Uranus had been castrated, his blood fell to earth (Gaia) and conceived the Giants. These were of monstrous appearance and had great strength.
2 CONC  Similiarly, in some versions Aphrodite is believed to have risen from the foam created by the sex organs of Uranus after they were thrown into the sea by his son Cronus. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus was aghast by the sight of his offspring, the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires. (In a differing version Uranus was frightened of their great strength and the fact that they could easily depos
2 CONC e him). He hid them away in Tartarus (the bowels of the earth) inside Gaia, causing her intense pain. The discomfort became so great that she asked her youngest son, Cronus, to castrate his father, as
2 CONC  this would cease his fertility and put an end to more monstrous offspring. To accomplish this deed Gaia made an adamantine sickle, which she gave to Cronus. That night Uranus came to lay with Gaia. A
2 CONC nd as the sky god drew close, Cronus struck with the sickle and cut off Uranus's genitals. From the blood that fell from the open wound were born nymphs and giants, and when Cronus threw the severed g
2 CONC enitals into the sea a white foam appeared. From this foam Aphrodite the goddess of love and desire was born. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A slightly differing version tells of Uranus being so vast that he could cover Mother Earth (Gaia) and easily take advantage of her fruitfulness, but Gaia tired of her exuberant fertility and begge
2 CONC d her sons to free her from the excessive embrace of Uranus. All refused except Cronus. Armed with a sickle he castrated Uranus, and the blood which fell from the mutilation gave birth to the Erinyes 
2 CONC (Furies), the Giants and the Meliae (Nymphs of the manna ash trees). And when Cronus threw the sickle into the sea the island of Corfu, home of the Phaeacians, sprang up). 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Uranus (the sky) had been emasculated, the sky separated from Gaia (the earth) and Cronus became king of the gods. Later, Zeus (the son of Cronus) deposed his father and became the supreme go

2 CONT <p>[edit] Creation myth</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Olympian creation myth, as Hesiod tells it in Theogony, Uranus came every night to cover the earth and mate with Gaia, but he hated the children she bore him.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hesiod names the Titans, six sons and six daughters, the one-hundred-armed giants (Hecatonchires) and the one-eyed giants, the Cyclopes.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in Tartarus, deep within Earth, where they caused pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to castrate Uranus. Only Cronus,
2 CONC  youngest of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and castrated him, casting the severed testicles into the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons Titanes Theoi, or "Straining Gods"[3].</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the blood which spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the Gigantes, the three avenging Furies — the Erinyes — Meliae, the ash-tree nymphs, and according to some, the Telchines.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the genitals in the sea came forth Aphrodite. The learned Alexandrian poet Callimachus[4] reported that the bloodied sickle had been buried in the earth at Zancle in Sicily, but the Romanized 
2 CONC Greek traveller Pausanias was informed that the sickle had been thrown into the sea from the cape near Bolina, not far from Argyra on the coast of Achaea, whereas the historian Timaeus located the sic
2 CONC kle at Corcyra;[5] Corcyrans claimed to be descendants of the wholly legendary Phaeacia visited by Odysseus, and by ca 500 BCE one Greek mythographer, Acusilaus, was claiming that the Phaeacians had s
2 CONC prung from the very blood of Uranus' castration.[6]

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>These ancient myths of distant origins were not expressed in cults among the Hellenes[7] The function of Uranus was as the vanquished god of an elder time, before real time began.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After his castration, the Sky came no more to cover the Earth at night, but held to its place, and "the original begetting came to an end" (Kerényi). Uranus was scarcely regarded as anthropomorphi
2 CONC c, aside from the genitalia in the castration myth. He was simply the sky, which was conceived by the ancients as an overarching dome or roof of bronze, held in place (or turned on an axis) by the Tit
2 CONC an Atlas. In formulaic expressions in the Homeric poems ouranos is sometimes an alternative to Olympus as the collective home of the gods; an obvious occurrence would be the moment at the end of Iliad
2 CONC  i, when Thetis rises from the sea to plead with Zeus: "and early in the morning she rose up to greet Ouranos-and-Olympus and she found the son of Kronos..."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"'Olympus' is almost always used of that home, but ouranos often refers to the natural sky above us without any suggestion that the gods, collectively live there," William Sale remarked;[8] Sale co

2 CONT <p>[edit] Creation myth</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Olympian creation myth, as Hesiod tells it in Theogony, Uranus came every night to cover the earth and mate with Gaia, but he hated the children she bore him.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hesiod names the Titans, six sons and six daughters, the one-hundred-armed giants (Hecatonchires) and the one-eyed giants, the Cyclopes.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in Tartarus, deep within Earth, where they caused pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to castrate Uranus. Only Cronus,
2 CONC  youngest of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and castrated him, casting the severed testicles into the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons Titanes Theoi, or "Straining Gods"[3].</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the blood which spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the Gigantes, the three avenging Furies — the Erinyes — Meliae, the ash-tree nymphs, and according to some, the Telchines.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the genitals in the sea came forth Aphrodite. The learned Alexandrian poet Callimachus[4] reported that the bloodied sickle had been buried in the earth at Zancle in Sicily, but the Romanized 
2 CONC Greek traveller Pausanias was informed that the sickle had been thrown into the sea from the cape near Bolina, not far from Argyra on the coast of Achaea, whereas the historian Timaeus located the sic
2 CONC kle at Corcyra;[5] Corcyrans claimed to be descendants of the wholly legendary Phaeacia visited by Odysseus, and by ca 500 BCE one Greek mythographer, Acusilaus, was claiming that the Phaeacians had s
2 CONC prung from the very blood of Uranus' castration.[6]

2 CONT <p>After Uranus was deposed, Kronos re-imprisoned the Hecatonchires and Cyclopes in Tartarus. Uranus and Gaia then prophesied that Kronos in turn was destined to be overthrown by his own son, and so t
2 CONC he Titan attempted to avoid this fate by devouring his young. Zeus, through deception by his mother Rhea, avoided this fate.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>These ancient myths of distant origins were not expressed in cults among the Hellenes[7] The function of Uranus was as the vanquished god of an elder time, before real time began.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After his castration, the Sky came no more to cover the Earth at night, but held to its place, and "the original begetting came to an end" (Kerényi). Uranus was scarcely regarded as anthropomorphi
2 CONC c, aside from the genitalia in the castration myth. He was simply the sky, which was conceived by the ancients as an overarching dome or roof of bronze, held in place (or turned on an axis) by the Tit
2 CONC an Atlas. In formulaic expressions in the Homeric poems ouranos is sometimes an alternative to Olympus as the collective home of the gods; an obvious occurrence would be the moment at the end of Iliad
2 CONC  i, when Thetis rises from the sea to plead with Zeus: "and early in the morning she rose up to greet Ouranos-and-Olympus and she found the son of Kronos..."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"'Olympus' is almost always used of that home, but ouranos often refers to the natural sky above us without any suggestion that the gods, collectively live there," William Sale remarked;[8] Sale co
2 CONC ncluded that the earlier seat of the gods was the actual Mount Olympus, from which the epic tradition by the time of Homer had transported them to the sky, ouranos. By the sixth century, when a "heave
2 CONC nly Aphrodite" was to be distinguished from the "common Aphrodite of the people", ouranos signifies purely the celestial sphere itself.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus, also known as Ouranos, was the embodiment of the sky or heavens, and known as the god of the sky. He was the first son of Gaia (the earth) and he also became her husband. According to Hesio
2 CONC d, their children included the Titans: six sons (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus and Cronus) and six daughters (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe and Tethys). There were other offspring:
2 CONC  the Cyclopes, (who were named Brontes, Steropes and Arges and were later known as "one eyed giants"), and also the three monsters known as the Hecatonchires, who each had one hundred hands and fifty 
2 CONC heads. Their names were Briareus, Cottus and Gyes. Other offspring of Uranus and Gaia were the Erinyes, who were spirits of punishment and goddesses of vengeance. The Erinyes avenged wrongs which were
2 CONC  done to family, especially murder within a family. After Uranus had been castrated, his blood fell to earth (Gaia) and conceived the Giants. These were of monstrous appearance and had great strength.
2 CONC  Similiarly, in some versions Aphrodite is believed to have risen from the foam created by the sex organs of Uranus after they were thrown into the sea by his son Cronus. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus was aghast by the sight of his offspring, the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires. (In a differing version Uranus was frightened of their great strength and the fact that they could easily depos
2 CONC e him). He hid them away in Tartarus (the bowels of the earth) inside Gaia, causing her intense pain. The discomfort became so great that she asked her youngest son, Cronus, to castrate his father, as
2 CONC  this would cease his fertility and put an end to more monstrous offspring. To accomplish this deed Gaia made an adamantine sickle, which she gave to Cronus. That night Uranus came to lay with Gaia. A
2 CONC nd as the sky god drew close, Cronus struck with the sickle and cut off Uranus's genitals. From the blood that fell from the open wound were born nymphs and giants, and when Cronus threw the severed g
2 CONC enitals into the sea a white foam appeared. From this foam Aphrodite the goddess of love and desire was born. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A slightly differing version tells of Uranus being so vast that he could cover Mother Earth (Gaia) and easily take advantage of her fruitfulness, but Gaia tired of her exuberant fertility and begge
2 CONC d her sons to free her from the excessive embrace of Uranus. All refused except Cronus. Armed with a sickle he castrated Uranus, and the blood which fell from the mutilation gave birth to the Erinyes 
2 CONC (Furies), the Giants and the Meliae (Nymphs of the manna ash trees). And when Cronus threw the sickle into the sea the island of Corfu, home of the Phaeacians, sprang up). 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Uranus (the sky) had been emasculated, the sky separated from Gaia (the earth) and Cronus became king of the gods. Later, Zeus (the son of Cronus) deposed his father and became the supreme go
2 CONC d of the Greek Pantheon.</p>

2 CONT <p>Uranus is the Latinized form of Ouranos (Οὐρανός), the Greek word for sky. In Greek mythology Uranus is personified as the son and husband of Gaia, Mother Earth (Hesiod, Theogony). Uranus a
2 CONC nd Gaia were ancestors of most of the Greek gods.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Other sources claim a different parentage of Ouranos. Cicero, in De Natura Deorum ("The Nature of the Gods") claims that he was the offspring of the ancient gods Aether and Hemera. According to the
2 CONC  Orphic Hymns, Ouranos was the son of the personification of night, Nyx.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His equivalent in Roman mythology was Caelus, likewise from caelum the Latin word for "sky".</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Olympian creation myth, as Hesiod tells it in Theogony, Uranus came every single night to cover the earth and mate with Gaia, but he hated the children she bore him. Hesiod names the Titans,
2 CONC  six sons and six daughters, the one-hundred-armed giants (Hecatonchires) and the one-eyed giants, the Cyclopes. He imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in Tartarus, deep within Earth, where they cause
2 CONC d pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to castrate Uranus. Only Cronus, youngest of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and castrated him, casting the se
2 CONC vered testicles into the sea. For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons Titanes Theoi, or "Straining Gods"[1].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the blood which spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the Gigantes, the three avenging Furies — the Erinyes — Meliae, the ash-tree nymphs, and according to some the Telchines. From
2 CONC  the genitals in the sea came forth Aphrodite. Some say the bloodied sickle was buried in the earth and from this was born the fabulous Phaeacian tribe.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Uranus was deposed, Cronus re-imprisoned the Hecatonchires and Cyclopes in Tartarus. Uranus and Gaia then prophesied that Cronus in turn was destined to be overthrown by his own son, and so t
2 CONC he Titan attempted to avoid this fate by devouring his young. Zeus, through deception by his mother Rhea, avoided this fate.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>These ancient myths of distant origins were not expressed in cults among the Hellenes (Kerenyi p. 20). The function of Uranus is as the vanquished god of an elder time, before real time began. Afte
2 CONC r his castration, the Sky came no more to cover the Earth at night, but held to its place, and "the original begetting came to an end" (Kerenyi).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus was scarcely regarded as anthropomorphic, aside from the genitalia in the castration myth. He was simply the sky, which was conceived by the ancients as an overarching dome or roof of bronze
2 CONC , held in place (or turned on an axis) by the Titan Atlas.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the genitals in the sea came forth Aphrodite. The learned Alexandrian poet Callimachus[4] reported that the bloodied sickle had been buried in the earth at Zancle in Sicily, but the Romanized 
2 CONC Greek traveller Pausanias was informed that the sickle had been thrown into the sea from the cape near Bolina, not far from Argyra on the coast of Achaea, whereas the historian Timaeus located the sic
2 CONC kle at Corcyra;[5] Corcyrans claimed to be descendants of the wholly legendary Phaeacia visited by Odysseus, and by ca 500 BCE one Greek mythographer, Acusilaus, was claiming that the Phaeacians had s

2 CONC  i, when Thetis rises from the sea to plead with Zeus: "and early in the morning she rose up to greet Ouranos-and-Olympus and she found the son of Kronos..."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"'Olympus' is almost always used of that home, but ouranos often refers to the natural sky above us without any suggestion that the gods, collectively live there," William Sale remarked;[8] Sale co
2 CONC ncluded that the earlier seat of the gods was the actual Mount Olympus, from which the epic tradition by the time of Homer had transported them to the sky, ouranos. By the sixth century, when a "heave

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus, also known as Ouranos, was the embodiment of the sky or heavens, and known as the god of the sky. He was the first son of Gaia (the earth) and he also became her husband. According to Hesio
2 CONC d, their children included the Titans: six sons (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus and Cronus) and six daughters (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe and Tethys). There were other offspring:
2 CONC  the Cyclopes, (who were named Brontes, Steropes and Arges and were later known as "one eyed giants"), and also the three monsters known as the Hecatonchires, who each had one hundred hands and fifty 
2 CONC heads. Their names were Briareus, Cottus and Gyes. Other offspring of Uranus and Gaia were the Erinyes, who were spirits of punishment and goddesses of vengeance. The Erinyes avenged wrongs which were
2 CONC  done to family, especially murder within a family. After Uranus had been castrated, his blood fell to earth (Gaia) and conceived the Giants. These were of monstrous appearance and had great strength.
2 CONC  Similiarly, in some versions Aphrodite is believed to have risen from the foam created by the sex organs of Uranus after they were thrown into the sea by his son Cronus. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus was aghast by the sight of his offspring, the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires. (In a differing version Uranus was frightened of their great strength and the fact that they could easily depos
2 CONC e him). He hid them away in Tartarus (the bowels of the earth) inside Gaia, causing her intense pain. The discomfort became so great that she asked her youngest son, Cronus, to castrate his father, as
2 CONC  this would cease his fertility and put an end to more monstrous offspring. To accomplish this deed Gaia made an adamantine sickle, which she gave to Cronus. That night Uranus came to lay with Gaia. A
2 CONC nd as the sky god drew close, Cronus struck with the sickle and cut off Uranus's genitals. From the blood that fell from the open wound were born nymphs and giants, and when Cronus threw the severed g
2 CONC enitals into the sea a white foam appeared. From this foam Aphrodite the goddess of love and desire was born. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A slightly differing version tells of Uranus being so vast that he could cover Mother Earth (Gaia) and easily take advantage of her fruitfulness, but Gaia tired of her exuberant fertility and begge
2 CONC d her sons to free her from the excessive embrace of Uranus. All refused except Cronus. Armed with a sickle he castrated Uranus, and the blood which fell from the mutilation gave birth to the Erinyes 
2 CONC (Furies), the Giants and the Meliae (Nymphs of the manna ash trees). And when Cronus threw the sickle into the sea the island of Corfu, home of the Phaeacians, sprang up). 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Uranus (the sky) had been emasculated, the sky separated from Gaia (the earth) and Cronus became king of the gods. Later, Zeus (the son of Cronus) deposed his father and became the supreme go
2 CONC d of the Greek Pantheon.</p>

2 CONT <p>El concepto de la Tierra como un organismo viviente es común en las creencias de muchas culturas a lo largo de la Historia. Y no sólo se ha visto el planeta como un ser vivo, sino como algo sagra

2 CONC Tierra.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>El hecho es que se ha venerado con distintos nombres: Pachamama, Tonantsin, Deméter la "madre", Perséfone la "hija", o Hécate la "vieja" que eran tres aspectos de la misma diosa que podría iden

2 CONT <p>Gaia (en griego "suelo" o "tierra", también deletreado Ge, Gea, Gaea o Gaya) personifica en la mitología griega la fertilidad de la Tierra. Con Urano, Gaia tuvo tres grupos de hijos: los Titanes

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p> Background</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gaia, more frequently spelled Ge, was the Earth. She is rarely even referred to as a deity, she is more a power. What is. She was one of the firsts. Well, one of the firsts in some versions. There 
2 CONC are actually a couple of different Creation myths, and not all of them include Gaia (I know, it shocked me, too). The original Greek Mythology (ie, pre-Classical) was was Pelasgian myth (the Pelasgian
2 CONC s came to Greece from the Asia Minor 3,000 years before Hesiod). The Pelasgian creation story focuses on Eurynome, the Goddess of All Things. But you can go to the Myth Page on Eurynome's Creation Sto
2 CONC ry if you want to learn more about that. Here, we will focus on Gaia. There are two parts: .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"First in my prayer, before all other deities,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I call upon Gaia, Primeval Prophetess . . . </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Greek great earth mother."</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>~Aeschylus~</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Creation of Her</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There are two accepted versions of Classical creation: Hesiod's and Ovid's. Both versions begin with Gaia's emergence from Chaos. She has a parthenogenic birth (ie, only one parent needed). Accordi
2 CONC ng to Ovid, Gaia pretty much just appeared (similar to the Judeo-Christian creation story). After her birth, Ovid continued to see the hand of a Creator at work (an un-named Creator), who populated Ga
2 CONC ia with the necessary mountains, seas, flora, and fauna. I much prefer Hesiod's version.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before I tell you about what Hesiod had to say, I'm going to give you this wonderful quote from his creation story:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gaia, the beautiful, rose up,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Broad blossomed, she that is the steadfast base</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Of all things. And fair Gaia first bore</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The starry Heaven, equal to herself,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>To cover her on all sides and to be</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A home forever for the blessed Gods.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>And now back to the story. According to Hesiod, the first beings sprang into existance without cause or explanation. After Gaia came Tartarus (the lowest level of the Underworld, also viewed as a s
2 CONC ort of huge cave or pit) and then came Eros: Erotic Love. Chaos continues her parthenogenic streak, giving birth to Erebus and Nyx. In her sleep, Gaia gives parthenogenic birth to Uranus (the Universe
2 CONC , who emerges as big and powerful as Gaia) and Pontus (the Sea, and the God of the Sea). Uranus, bursting (literally) with love for Gaia (possible only by the creation of Eros, you see), showers her w
2 CONC ith fertile rain and this is how Gaia gives birth to the rest of creation (you remember, seas, mountains, etc. - we already covered this with Ovid). Gaia and Uranus also gave birth to the Titans, the 
2 CONC three Cyclopes and the three Hundred-Armed Giants.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Creation by Her</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There aren't tons of stories about Gaia. She's important, yes, and she shows up a lot, but not so much as an active participant in the story so much as a default womb and mother. She has LOTS of ki
2 CONC ds. And what really makes her special is that she can have these kids without active participation by a father. In many ways the Universe was created by her alone (okay, not really - but she did give 
2 CONC birth to her son Uranus who then became her partner in the whole populating space thing). Once, Zeus had a wet dream at night that got Gaia pregnant, too (the child of that union was Agdistis).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There's a bunch of other mentions of her giving birth to people (especially men) - one of the most important was Erichthonius, who founded Athens.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gaia's Children Include: </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•Uranus (yes I know he was her "husband" - but he was also her son - very Oedipal isn't it?...) </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•50-Headed, 100-Armed Giants: Cottus, Briareus, and Gyges </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•The Cyclopes: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges (Cyclope means Wheel-Eyed </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•The Titans: Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Cronus, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Tethys </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•The Erinyes: Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megara </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•Giants: born full-grown with armor and spears, ouchies for Gaia </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•Meliads: otherwise known as the Ash Tree Nymphs </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•Aetna, Eurybia, Nereus, Phorcys, Ceto, Thaumas, Atlas, Acheron, Antaeus, Agdistis, Erichthonius, Hyllus, Dreams, Python, the list goes on. </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Don't know who your mama is? That's okay, Gaia's the default, and you can always accurately claim her. A good mythical example of this is when Pyrrha and Deucalion had to throw their mothers' bones
2 CONC  over their shoulders!</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Yay Ge!</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The King Must Die</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Forgive me for ripping off Mary Renault's title, but if there's any goddess the idea really relates to, I think it would be Gaia. The theory is that every year the king was ritually sacrificed (kil
2 CONC led by a rival, sacrificed in public, or only metaphorically murdered) to renew the land and the fertility of the kingdom. I'm not really gonna get any further into that because it's not actually from
2 CONC  any Greek myth in particular, but it does seem like at least a decent introduction to the myth in which Gaia took her most active role.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>So, Gaia and Uranus had a whole bunch of babies, as described above. Uranus, like many men, did his part in creating the children, but wasn't ready to be a daddy and tried to stuff the new life bac
2 CONC k into Gaia's womb. Then he tried to keep the kids inside her by blocking the entrance. With his own genitals. Can you imagine? Well, Gaia turned around (inside?) and gave her youngest son, Cronos (th
2 CONC e Titan) a scythe to cut off his papa's penis and free the children. As a consequence, Cronos also took over as the Big God In Charge - a role previously held by Uranus, despite the appearance that it
2 CONC  was Gaia with the real power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Unfortunately, despite getting how he was put into power, Cronos only repeated the cycle. He put the Giants and the Cyclopes into Tartarus (deep pit type of jail) and whenever his wife, Rhea, gave 
2 CONC birth, he swallowed the baby. He was threatened, it appears by this whole biological process that was beyond his control. After five pregnancies and five births and five babies devoured, Rhea went to 
2 CONC Gaia and the two conspired to keep her youngest son - Zeus - from being swallowed and then got Cronos to vomit up the other ingested gods. With the promise from Zeus that he would free the other child
2 CONC ren of Earth, Gaia supported him in overthrowing Cronos and the rule of the Titans. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Will it surprise you to learn that Zeus did not remain true to the women who made him and put him in power? Almost immediately he stuck Gaia's monstrous children back in Tartarus. And when his woma
2 CONC n, Metis, became pregnant, he started getting worried that like father like child. But he had learned more from his mothers than they intended. Rather than try to force his mate into submission or to 
2 CONC steal her progeny, he skipped that altogether by swallowing her! When she gave birth, it was inside his body, and the child, Athena, had to be born of HIS body. By co-opting the labor and the birth, h
2 CONC e kept Athena from any allegiance to a mother and broke the cycle of Kings dying to maintain the proper balance of Earth. The power of fertility was usurped by the patriarchy and Gaia stopped, for the
2 CONC  most part, involving herself in the lives of her children.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Oh Goddess, Source of Gods and Mortals,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>All-Fertile, All-Destroying Gaia,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mother of All, Who brings forth the bounteous fruits and flowers,</p>

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Tethys (mythology)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Classical Greek mythology, Tethys (Greek Τηθύς), daughter of Uranus and Gaia (Hesiod, Theogony lines 136, 337 and Bibliotheke 1.2) is an aquatic sea goddess. Tethys was both sister and wife
2 CONC  of Oceanus.[1] She was mother of the chief rivers of the world known to the Greeks, such as the Nile, the Alpheus, the Maeander, and about three thousand daughters called the Oceanids.[2] Considered 
2 CONC as an embodiment of the waters of the world she also may be seen as a counterpart of Thalassa, the embodiment of the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although these vestiges imply a strong role in earlier times, Tethys plays virtually no part in recorded Greek literary texts, or historical records of Greek religion or cults. Walter Burkert[3] no
2 CONC tes the presence of Tethys in the episode of Iliad XIV that the Ancients called the "Deception of Zeus", where Hera, to mislead Zeus, says she wants to go to Oceanus, "origin of the gods" and Tethys "
2 CONC the mother". Burkert [4] sees in the name a transformation of Akkadian tiamtu or tâmtu, "the sea," which is recognizable in Tiamat.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>One of the few representations of Tethys that is identified securely by an accompanying inscription is the Late Antique (fourth century CE) mosaic from the flooring of a thermae at Antioch, now at 
2 CONC Dumbarton Oaks, in Washington, D.C.[5] In the Dumbarton Oaks mosaic, the bust of Tethys—surrounded by fishes—is rising, bare-shouldered from the waters. Against her shoulder rests a golden ship's 
2 CONC rudder. Gray wings sprout from her forehead, as in the mosaics illustrated above and below.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the war against the Titans, Tethys raised Rhea as her god-child, but there are no records of active cults for Tethys in historic times.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tethys has sometimes been confused [6] with another sea goddess who became the sea-nymph Thetis, the wife of Peleus and mother of Achilles during Classical times. Some myths imply a second generati
2 CONC on relationship between the two, a grandmother and granddaughter.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Indicative of the power exercised by Tethys, one myth[7] relates that the prominent goddess of the Olympians, Hera, was not pleased with the placement of Callisto and Arcas in the sky, as the const

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Classical Greek mythology, Tethys (Greek Τηθύς), daughter of Uranus and Gaia (Hesiod, Theogony lines 136, 337 and Bibliotheke 1.2) is an aquatic sea goddess. Tethys was both sister and wife
2 CONC  of Oceanus.[1] She was mother of the chief rivers of the world known to the Greeks, such as the Nile, the Alpheus, the Maeander, and about three thousand daughters called the Oceanids.[2] Considered 
2 CONC as an embodiment of the waters of the world she also may be seen as a counterpart of Thalassa, the embodiment of the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although these vestiges imply a strong role in earlier times, Tethys plays virtually no part in recorded Greek literary texts, or historical records of Greek religion or cults. Walter Burkert[3] no
2 CONC tes the presence of Tethys in the episode of Iliad XIV that the Ancients called the "Deception of Zeus", where Hera, to mislead Zeus, says she wants to go to Oceanus, "origin of the gods" and Tethys "
2 CONC the mother". Burkert [4] sees in the name a transformation of Akkadian tiamtu or tâmtu, "the sea," which is recognizable in Tiamat.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>One of the few representations of Tethys that is identified securely by an accompanying inscription is the Late Antique (fourth century CE) mosaic from the flooring of a thermae at Antioch, now at 
2 CONC Dumbarton Oaks, in Washington, D.C.[5] In the Dumbarton Oaks mosaic, the bust of Tethys—surrounded by fishes—is rising, bare-shouldered from the waters. Against her shoulder rests a golden ship's 
2 CONC rudder. Gray wings sprout from her forehead, as in the mosaics illustrated above and below.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the war against the Titans, Tethys raised Rhea as her god-child, but there are no records of active cults for Tethys in historic times.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tethys has sometimes been confused [6] with another sea goddess who became the sea-nymph Thetis, the wife of Peleus and mother of Achilles during Classical times. Some myths imply a second generati
2 CONC on relationship between the two, a grandmother and granddaughter.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Indicative of the power exercised by Tethys, one myth[7] relates that the prominent goddess of the Olympians, Hera, was not pleased with the placement of Callisto and Arcas in the sky, as the const
2 CONC ellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, so she asked her nurse, Tethys, to help. Tethys, a marine goddess, caused the constellations forever to circle the sky and never drop below the horizon, hence expl
2 CONC aining why they are circumpolar. Robert Graves interprets the use of the term nurse in Classical myths as identifying deities who once were goddesses of central importance in the periods before histor
2 CONC ical documentation.[8]

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Oceanus (Greek: Ὠκεανός, lit. "ocean") was believed to be the world-ocean in classical antiquity, which the ancient Romans and Greeks considered to be an enormous river encircl
2 CONC ing the world. Strictly speaking, Okeanos was the ocean-stream at the Equator in which floated the habitable hemisphere (oikoumene οἰκουμένη).[1] In Greek mythology, this world-ocean was per
2 CONC sonified as a Titan, a son of Uranus and Gaia. In Hellenistic and Roman mosaics, this Titan was often depicted as having the upper body of a muscular man with a long beard and horns (often represented
2 CONC  as the claws of a crab), and the lower torso of a serpent (cf. Typhon). On a fragmentary archaic vessel (British Museum 1971.11-1.1) of ca 580 BC, among the gods arriving at the wedding of Peleus and
2 CONC  the sea-nymph Thetis, is a fish-tailed Oceanus, with a fish in one hand and a serpent in the other, gifts of bounty and prophecy. In Roman mosaics he might carry a steering-oar and cradle a ship.

2 CONT <p>OKEANOS (or Oceanus) was the Titan god or Protogenos (primeval deity) of the great earth-encircling river Okeanos, the font of all the earth's fresh-water: including rivers, wells, springs and rain
2 CONC -clouds. Okeanos was also the god who regulated the rising and setting of the heavenly bodies which were believed to emerge and descend into his watery realm at the ends of the earth. Okeanos' wife wa
2 CONC s Tethys, the nurse, who was probably thought to distribute his water to the earth via subterranean caverns. Their children were the Potamoi or River-Gods and Okeanides, nymphs of springs and fountain
2 CONC s. Unlike his brother Titanes, Okeanos neither participated in the castration of Ouranos nor joined the battle against the younger Olympian gods. He was probably identical to Ophion, an elder Titan in
2 CONC  the Orphic myths who ruled heaven briefly before being wrestled and cast into the Ocean stream by Kronos.

2 CONT <p>Okeanos was depicted in ancient Greek vase painting as a bull-horned god with the tail of a serpentine fish in place of legs, similar to his river-god sons. His usual attributes were a fish and ser

2 CONC scarded. In mosaic art he therefore appears simply as a sea-god or the sea personified, with crab-claw horns, and for attributes, a serpent, oar and school of fish. His wife Tethys, shown seated besid

2 CONT <p>OCE′ANUS (Ôkeanos), the god of the river Oceanus, by which, according to the most ancient notions of the Greeks, the whole earth was surrounded. An account of this river belongs to mythical geog
2 CONC raphy, and we shall here confine ourselves to describing the place which Oceanus holds in the ancient cosmogony. In the Homeric poems he appears as a mighty god, who yields to none save Zeus. (Il. xiv
2 CONC . 245, xx. 7, xxi. 195.) Homer does not mention his parentage, but calls Tethys his wife, by whom he had three daughters, Thetis, Eurynome and Perse. (Il. xiv. 302, xviii. 398, Od. x. 139.) His palace
2 CONC  is placed somewhere in the west (Il. xiv. 303, &c.), and there he and Tethys brought up Hera, who was conveyed to them at the time when Zeus was engaged in the struggle with the Titans. Hesiod (Theog
2 CONC . 133, 337, &c., 349, &c.) calls Oceanus a son of Uranus and Gaea, the eldest of the Titans, and the husband of Tethys, by whom he begot 3000 rivers, and as many Oceanides, of whom Hesiod mentions onl
2 CONC y the eldest. (Comp. Apollod. iii. 8. § 1, 10. § 1.) This poet (Theog. 282) also speaks of sources of Oceanus. Representations of the god are seen on imperial coins of Tyre and Alexandria.

2 CONT <p>OCE′ANUS (Ôkeanos), the god of the river Oceanus, by which, according to the most ancient notions of the Greeks, the whole earth was surrounded. An account of this river belongs to mythical geog
2 CONC raphy, and we shall here confine ourselves to describing the place which Oceanus holds in the ancient cosmogony. In the Homeric poems he appears as a mighty god, who yields to none save Zeus. (Il. xiv
2 CONC . 245, xx. 7, xxi. 195.) Homer does not mention his parentage, but calls Tethys his wife, by whom he had three daughters, Thetis, Eurynome and Perse. (Il. xiv. 302, xviii. 398, Od. x. 139.) His palace
2 CONC  is placed somewhere in the west (Il. xiv. 303, &c.), and there he and Tethys brought up Hera, who was conveyed to them at the time when Zeus was engaged in the struggle with the Titans. Hesiod (Theog
2 CONC . 133, 337, &c., 349, &c.) calls Oceanus a son of Uranus and Gaea, the eldest of the Titans, and the husband of Tethys, by whom he begot 3000 rivers, and as many Oceanides, of whom Hesiod mentions onl
2 CONC y the eldest. (Comp. Apollod. iii. 8. § 1, 10. § 1.) This poet (Theog. 282) also speaks of sources of Oceanus. Representations of the god are seen on imperial coins of Tyre and Alexandria.

2 CONT <p>OKEANOS (or Oceanus) was the Titan god or Protogenos (primeval deity) of the great earth-encircling river Okeanos, the font of all the earth's fresh-water: including rivers, wells, springs and rain

2 CONC s Tethys, the nurse, who was probably thought to distribute his water to the earth via subterranean caverns. Their children were the Potamoi or River-Gods and Okeanides, nymphs of springs and fountain
2 CONC s. Unlike his brother Titanes, Okeanos neither participated in the castration of Ouranos nor joined the battle against the younger Olympian gods. He was probably identical to Ophion, an elder Titan in
2 CONC  the Orphic myths who ruled heaven briefly before being wrestled and cast into the Ocean stream by Kronos.

2 CONT <p>Okeanos was depicted in ancient Greek vase painting as a bull-horned god with the tail of a serpentine fish in place of legs, similar to his river-god sons. His usual attributes were a fish and ser

2 CONT <p>In classical antiquity, Oceanus (from Greek: Ὠκεανός, lit. "ocean") was believed to be the world-ocean, which the ancient Romans and Greeks considered to be an enormous river encircling the
2 CONC  world. Strictly speaking, Oceanus was the ocean-stream at the Equator  in which floated the habitable hemisphere (oikoumene οἰκουμένη). In Greek mythology, this world-ocean was personified 
2 CONC as a Titan, a son of Uranus and Gaia. In Hellenistic and Roman mosaics, this Titan was often depicted as having the upper body of a muscular man with a long beard and horns (often represented as the c
2 CONC laws of a crab), and the lower torso of a serpent (cf. Typhon). On a fragmentary archaic vessel (British Museum 1971.11-1.1) of ca 580 BC, among the gods arriving at the wedding of Peleus and the sea-
2 CONC nymph Thetis, is a fish-tailed Oceanus, with a fish in one hand and a serpent in the other, gifts of bounty and prophecy. In Roman mosaics he might carry a steering-oar and cradle a ship.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some scholars believe that Oceanus originally represented all bodies of salt water, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, the two largest bodies known to the ancient Greeks. Howev
2 CONC er, as geography became more accurate, Oceanus came to represent the stranger, more unknown waters of the Atlantic Ocean (also called the "Ocean Sea"), while the newcomer of a later generation, Poseid
2 CONC on, ruled over the Mediterranean.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Oceanus' consort is his sister Tethys, and from their union came the ocean nymphs, also known as the three-thousand Oceanids, and all the rivers of the world, fountains, and lakes. From Cronus, of 
2 CONC the race of Titans, the Olympian gods have their birth, and Hera mentions twice in Iliad book xiv her intended journey "to the ends of the generous earth on a visit to Oceanus, whence the gods have ri

2 CONC hter. Aeolia married Calydon, by whom she became the mother of Epicaste and Protogeneia. Since Calydon was the founder of the town of Calydon, Aeolia can by considered the mother of the Calydonian dyn
2 CONC asty. [Apollodorus 1.7.7.]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>CALYCE was a daughter of Aeolus and Enarete. Her family tree produced some of the greatest heroes and heroines in mythology, since her brothers were Cretheus, Sisyphus, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, M
2 CONC agnes, Perieres, and Macareus. She did well in her own right. She married Aethlius, son of Zeus and Protogeneia and grandson of Deucalion. By him she became the mother of the famous Endymion, who was 
2 CONC not only the lover of the moon goddess Selene but also king of Elis and ancestor of the Aetolians, Epeians, and Paeonians. By report, she had 50 half-immortal granddaughters by the union of Selene wit
2 CONC h her sleeping son, but this phenomenon is discussed elsewhere. [Apollodorus 1.7.2,3.5; Pausanias 5.1.2,8.1, 10.31.2.]

2 CONT <p>EIDOMENE, or Idomene, was a daughter of Pheres, son of Cretheus and Tyro, and Periclymene. Her brothers were Admetus and Lycurgus, and her sister was Periapis. Pheres founded the town of Pherae in 
2 CONC Thessaly. In one place Eidomene was referred to as the daughter of Abas. She married Amythaon, her uncle, thus becoming not only a cousin but also aunt of Jason, since Amythaon was brother to Aeson, J
2 CONC ason's father. By Amythaon she became the mother of sons Bias and Melampus, and a daughter Aeolia. She was sometimes called Aglaia or Dorippe. Amythaon migrated to Messenia and settled at the court of
2 CONC  Neleus, his half-brother. He started the Olympic games after the sons of Pelops left Elis. He went back to Thessaly to greet Jason when his nephew appeared at the court of Pelias. Bias and Melampus w
2 CONC ent on to become joint rulers in Argos because they were able to cure the insanity of the daughters of Proetus. Melampus was able to accomplish the cure through his combined gift of prophecy and medic
2 CONC al knowledge. Eidomene probably lived with her sons in Argos after Amythaon died and they had acquired their part of the kingdom. [Apollodorus 1.9.11, 2.2.2, 3.10.4, 13.8; Diodorus Siculus 4.68; Homer

2 CONT <p>MEROPE was one of the Pleiades. In the constellation of the Pleiades she is the seventh and least visible star because she was ashamed of having had intercourse with a mortal man. This mortal was S
2 CONC isyphus, and Merope should have been ashamed not so much that he was mortal but because of the type of mortal he was. He was the son of Aeolus and Enarete, and brother of Cretheus, Athamas, Salmoneus,
2 CONC  Deion, Magnes, Perieres, and Macareus. He eventually reigned in Corinth, since Medea gave him the sovereignty when she left. He promoted commerce and helped make the city important. He was of bad cha
2 CONC racter however, as Merope was soon to discover. She bore him Glaucus, Ornytion, Thersander, and Halmus. Sisyphus meanwhile had twin sons by his niece Tyro, but she killed them at their birth. Of Merop
2 CONC e's sons we know Glaucus best, not only as the father of Bellerophon but also as the breeder of flesh-eating mares. When Sisyphus was on his deathbed, he begged Merope not to bury him. She complied, a

2 CONT <p>KLYMENE (or Clymene) was the Titan goddess of renown, fame and infamy. She was one of the elder Okeanides, wife of the Titan Iapetos, mother of the Titanes Prometheus and Atlas and the ancestress o

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Klymene was also named Asia, and in this guise portrayed as the eponymous goddess of the region of Anatolia (i.e. Asia Minor). It should be noted that it was only later that geographers applied thi

2 CONT <p>Hermes drove the cattle back to Greece and hid them, and covered their tracks. When Apollo accused Hermes, Maia said that it could not be him because he was with her the whole night. However, Zeus 
2 CONC entered the argument and said that Hermes did steal the cattle and they should be returned. While arguing with Apollo, Hermes began to play his lyre. The instrument enchanted Apollo and he agreed to l
2 CONC et Hermes keep the cattle in exchange for the lyre.

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} In Greek mythology, Lētṓ (Greek: Λητώ, Λατώ, Lato in Dorian Greek, etymology and meaning disputed) is a daughter of the Titans Coeus and Phoebe: Kos claimed her birthplace. 
2 CONC In the Olympian scheme of things, Zeus is the father of her twins, Apollo and Artemis, the Letoides. For the classical Greeks, Leto is scarcely to be conceived apart from being pregnant and finding a 
2 CONC place to be delivered of Apollo and Artemis, for Hera being jealous, made it so all lands shunned her. Finally, she finds an island that isn't attached to the ocean floor so it isn't considered land a
2 CONC nd she can give birth. This is her one active mythic role: once Apollo and Artemis are grown, Leto withdraws, to remain a dim and benevolent matronly figure upon Olympus, her part already played.

2 CONT <p>El carácter guerrero de las tribus de Tracia llevó a la creencia de que el hogar de Ares estaba en ese país, que era junto con Escitia su principal centro de culto. Ares fue adorado en Escitia c

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>La adoración de Ares en los países al norte de Grecia parece indicar que su culto se introdujo en ellos desde Tracia, y el propio carácter del dios, como es descrito por la mayoría de losantigu

2 CONT <p>nes del dios, apareciendo principalmente en monedas, relieves y joyas.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aunque importante en la poesía, Ares fue raramente objeto de culto en la antigua Grecia, en comparación con otros dioses, salvo en Esparta, donde era apaciguado la víspera de la batalla, y en el

2 CONT <p>El templo a Ares en el ágora de Atenas que Pausanias vio en el siglo II sólo había sido trasladado y rededicado allí durante la época de Augusto: en esencia era un templo romano a Marte. Sin e

2 CONT <p>En La Ilíada, Homero representa a un Ares sin alianzas fijas ni respeto hacia Temis, el orden correcto de las cosas: prometió a Atenea y Hera que lucharía del lado de los aqueos, pero Afrodita l
2 CONC ogró persuadirle para que luchase junto a los troyan
2 CONT <p>os.26</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Durante la guerra, Diomedes se enfrentó a Héctor y vio a Ares luchando en el bando troyano. Diomedes pidió a sus soldados que se retirasen lentamente. Hera, la madre de Ares, vio la injerencia d
2 CONC e éste y pidió permiso a Zeus, su padre, para alejar
2 CONT <p>lo del campo de batalla. Ares atacó a Diomedes con su lanza, pero Atenea desvió el ataque. Diomedes respondió con la pica y Atenea guió el golpe para herir a Ares, quien en su caída bramócomo
2 CONC  nueve o diez mil hombres y huyó al monte Olimpo, lo q
2 CONT <p>ue obligó a los troyanos a retirarse.27</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cuando Hera mencionó durante una conversación con Zeus que su hijo Ascálafo había muerto, Ares rompió a llorar y quiso unirse a la batalla del lado de los aqueos contra la orden de Zeus de que
2 CONC  ningún olímpico debía participar en la guerra. Atenea
2 CONT <p> detuvo a Ares y le ayudó a quitarse la armadura.28 Más tarde, cuando Zeus permitió a los dioses tomar parte activa en la guerra de los mortales, Ares intentó vengarse de Atenea, pero terminó 
2 CONC herido de nuevo cuando ésta le golpeó con una piedra,
2 CONT <p> cubriendo al caer con su cuerpo tumbado siete yugadas.29</p>

2 CONT <p>Otros mitos editar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    * En la contienda de Tifón contra Zeus, Ares se vio obligado, junto con los otros dioses, a huir a Egipto, donde se metamorfoseó en un pez.30</p>
2 CONT <p>    * Ares dio a Hipólita el cinturón que luego le quitó Heracles.</p>
2 CONT <p>    * Cuando Afrodita amó a Adonis, un celoso Ares se transformó en un oso y mató a su rival. En algunas versiones de la historia de Adonis, Artemisa y Ares (su amante en ellas) enviaban un jaba
2 CONC lí para matarle (esta versión es sospechosa porque i
2 CONT <p>mplicaría que Artemisa mantuvo relaciones con Ares y, sin embargo, virtualmente todas las fuentes coinciden en que se mantuvo casta todo el tiempo).</p>
2 CONT <p>    * Según una tradición posterior, Ares mató a Halirrotio, hijo de Poseidón, cuando éste intentó violar a Alcipe, su hija con Agraulo. Poseidón exigió a Zeus que Ares fuese castigado, por
2 CONC  lo que fue llevado a juicio: el primer juicio por asesin

2 CONT <p>Aphrodite , in Greek religion and mythology, goddess of fertility, love, and beauty. Homer designated her the child of Zeus and Dione. Hesiod's account of her birth is more popular: she supposedly 
2 CONC rose from the foam of the sea where Uranus' genitals had fallen after he had been mutilated by Kronos. Aphrodite was married to Hephaestus. She loved Ares, by whom she bore Harmonia and, in some myths
2 CONC , Eros and Anteros. She was the mother of Hermaphroditus by Hermes and of Priapus by Dionysus. Zeus caused her to love the shepherd Anchises, by whom she bore Aeneas. Adonis, in whose legend Aphrodite
2 CONC  appears as a goddess of fertility, also won her favors. It was to Aphrodite that Paris awarded the apple of discord, which caused the dispute leading ultimately to the Trojan War. Worshiped throughou
2 CONC t Greece, she was the goddess of love, marriage, and family life; she was also worshiped as a war goddess, as at Sparta, and as a sea goddess and patroness of sailors. Aphrodite had important cults at
2 CONC  Cythera on Crete, at Paphos and Amathas on Cyprus, at Corinth, and at Mt. Eryx in Sicily. Probably of Eastern origin, she was similar in many of her attributes to the ancient Middle Eastern goddesses
2 CONC  Astarte and Ishtar . The Romans identified Aphrodite with Venus .

2 CONT <p>Two Ruling Houses  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tros succeeded his father Erichthonius to the throne. He gave his name to the land (Troad) and to the people living in the Troad (Trojans). His son, Ganymede was so beautiful, that Zeus in the form
2 CONC  of an eagle, abducted the youth. Ganymede became the cupbearer in Olympus. Zeus gave Tros a couple of immortal horses and vine made of gold, to compensate for abducting the king's son. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Dardanians people, was then divided into two separate groups, between his two other sons by Callirrhoë (Callirrhoe): Ilus and Assaracus. Assaracus succeeded his father and continued to rule at
2 CONC  Dardania, while Ilus chose to move closer to the sea. Ilus founded the city that he named Ilium, after himself. Ilium was, however, often called Troy, after his father. The two brothers began to rule
2 CONC  two separate houses. 
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Dardanian line, Assaracus' son, Capys, married Themiste, daughter of Ilus and Eurydice. Capys became the father of Anchises. Anchises was a lover of Aphrodite, who bore him a son and hero, A
2 CONC eneas. Zeus struck Anchises with a thunderbolt, when he boasted of having slept with the love-goddess. He became a cripple, unable to walk. His son ruled Dardania in his place. Aeneas was the only lea

2 CONT <p>The epithet Aphrodite Acidalia was occasionally added to her name, after the spring she used to bathe in, located in Boeotia (Virgil I, 720). She was also called Kypris or Cytherea after her allege
2 CONC d birth-places in Cyprus and Cythera, respectively. The island of Cythera was a center of her cult. She was associated with Hesperia and frequently accompanied by the Oreads, nymphs of the mountains.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aphrodite had a festival of her own, the Aphrodisiac, which was celebrated all over Greece but particularly in Athens and Corinth. In Corinth, intercourse with her priestesses was considered a meth
2 CONC od of worshipping Aphrodite.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aphrodite was associated with, and often depicted with dolphins, doves, swans, pomegranates, apples, myrtle, rose and lime trees.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Her Roman analogue is Venus. Her Mesopotamian counterpart was Ishtar. Her Egyptian counterpart is Hathor, and her Syro-Palestinian counterpart was ‘Ashtart (in standard Greek spelling Astarte); h
2 CONC er Etruscan equivalent was Turan.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Venus was often referred to with epithet Venus Erycina ("of the heather") after Mount Eryx, Sicily, one of the centers of her cult.</p>

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Birth</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"Foam-arisen" Aphrodite was born of the sea foam near Paphos, Cyprus after Cronus cut off Uranus' genitals and Cronus threw the genitals into the sea. Hesiod's Theogony described that the genitals 
2 CONC "were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with a girl grew" to become Aphrodite. Thus Aphrodite is of an older generation than Zeus. Iliad (Book V) expresse
2 CONC s another version of her origin, by which she was considered a daughter of Dione, who was the original oracular goddess ("Dione" being simply "the goddess," etymologically an equivalent of "Diana") at
2 CONC  Dodona. In Homer, Aphrodite, venturing into battle to protect her son, Aeneas, who has been wounded by Diomedes and returns to her mother, to sink down at her knee and be comforted. "Dione" seems to 
2 CONC be an equivalent of Rhea, the Earth Mother, whom Homer has relocated to Olympus. After this story, Aphrodite herself was sometimes referred to as "Dione". Once Zeus had usurped the oak-grove oracle at
2 CONC  Dodona, some poets made him out to be the father of Aphrodite.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aphrodite's chief center of worship remained at Paphos, on the south-western coast of Cyprus, where the goddess of desire had long been worshipped as Ishtar and Ashtaroth. It is said that she first
2 CONC  tentatively came ashore at Cytherea, a stopping place for trade and culture between Crete and the Peloponesus. Thus perhaps we have hints of the track of Aphrodite's original cult from the Levant to 
2 CONC mainland Greece.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Plato's Symposium the speech of Pausanias distinguishes two manifestations of Aphrodite, represented by the two stories: Aphrodite Ourania ("heavenly" Aphrodite), and Aphrodite Pandemos ("Common
2 CONC " Aphrodite). These two manifestations represented her role in homosexuality and heterosexuality, respectively.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Alternatively, Aphrodite was a daughter of Thalassa (for she was born of the Sea) and Zeus.</p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Adulthood</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aphrodite, in many of the myths involving her, is characterized as vain, ill-tempered and easily offended. Though she is one of the few gods of the Greek Pantheon to be actually married, she is fre
2 CONC quently unfaithful to her husband. Hephaestus, of course, is one of the most even-tempered of the Hellenic deities; Aphrodite seems to prefer Ares, the volatile god of war. In Homer's Iliad she surges
2 CONC  into battle to save her son, but abandons him (in fact, drops him as she flies through the air) when she herself is hurt (Ares does much the same thing). And she is the original cause of the Trojan W
2 CONC ar itself: not only did she start the whole affair by offering Helen of Troy to Paris, but the abduction was accomplished when Paris, seeing Helen for the first time, was inflamed with desire to have 
2 CONC her—which is Aphrodite's realm. Her domain may involve love, but it does not involve romance; rather, it tends more towards lust, the human irrational longing.
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Marriage with Hephaestus</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Due to her immense beauty, Zeus was frightened she'd be the cause of violence between the other gods. He married her off to Hephaestus, the dour, humorless god of smithing. Hephaestus was overjoyed
2 CONC  at being married to the goddess of beauty and forged her beautiful jewelry, including the cestus, a girdle that made her even more irresistible to men. Her unhappiness with her marriage caused Aphrod
2 CONC ite to seek out companionship from others, most frequently Ares, but also Adonis, Anchises and more. Hephaestus once cleverly caught Ares and Aphrodite in bed with finely wrought chains, and brought a
2 CONC ll the other Olympian gods together to mock the pair (however, the "goddesses stayed at home, all of them for shame.") Hephaestus would not free them until Poseidon promised Hephaestus that Ares would
2 CONC  pay reparations, but both escaped as soon as the chains were lifted and their promise was not kept.
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aphrodite and Psyche</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aphrodite was jealous of the beauty of a mortal woman named Psyche. She asked Eros to use his golden arrows to cause Psyche to fall in love with the ugliest man on earth. Eros agreed but then fell 
2 CONC in love with Psyche on his own, or by accidentally pricking himself with a golden arrow. Meanwhile, Psyche's parents were anxious that their daughter remained unmarried. They consulted an oracle who t
2 CONC old them she was destined for no mortal lover, but a monster who lived on top of a particular mountain. Psyche was resigned to her fate and climbed to the top of the mountain. There, Zephyrus, the wes
2 CONC t wind, gently floated her downwards. She entered a cave on the appointed mountain, surprised to find it full of jewellery and finery. Eros visited her every night in the cave and they made love; he d
2 CONC emanded only that she never light any lamps because he did not want her to know who he was (having wings made him distinctive). Her two sisters, jealous of Psyche, convinced her to do so one night and
2 CONC  she lit a lamp, recognizing him instantly. A drop of hot lamp oil fell on Eros' chest and he awoke, then fled.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Psyche told her two jealous elder sisters what had happened; they rejoiced secretly and each separately walked to the top of the mountain and did as Psyche described her entry to the cave, hop
2 CONC ing Eros would pick them instead. Zephyrus did not pick them and they fell to their deaths at the base of the mountain.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Psyche searched for her lover across much of Greece, finally stumbling into a temple to Demeter, where the floor was covered with piles of mixed grains. She started sorting the grains into organize
2 CONC d piles and, when she finished, Demeter spoke to her, telling her that the best way to find Eros was to find his mother, Aphrodite, and earn her blessing. Psyche found a temple to Aphrodite and entere
2 CONC d it. Aphrodite assigned her a similar task to Demeter's temple, but gave her an impossible deadline to finish it by. Eros intervened, for he still loved her, and caused some ants to organize the grai
2 CONC ns for her. Aphrodite was outraged at her success and told her to go to a field where golden sheep grazed and get some golden wool. Psyche went to the field and saw the sheep but was stopped by a rive
2 CONC r-god, whose river she had to cross to enter the field. He told her the sheep were mean and vicious and would kill her, but if she waited until noontime, the sheep would go the shade on the other side
2 CONC  of the field and sleep; she could pick the wool that stuck to the branches and bark of the trees. Psyche did so and Aphrodite was even more outraged at her survival and success. Finally, Aphrodite cl
2 CONC aimed that the stress of caring for her son, depressed and ill as a result of Psyche's unfaithfulness, had caused her to lose some of her beauty. Psyche was to go to Hades and ask Persephone, the quee
2 CONC n of the underworld, for a bit of her beauty in a black box that Aphrodite gave to Psyche. Psyche walked to a tower, deciding that the quickest way to the underworld would be to die. A voice stopped h
2 CONC er at the last moment and told her a route that would allow her to enter and return still living, as well as telling her how to pass Cerberus, Charon and the other dangers of the route. She pacified C
2 CONC erberus, the three-headed dog, with a sweet honey-cake and paid Charon an obolus to take her into Hades. On the way there, she saw hands reaching out of the water. A voice told her to toss a honey cak
2 CONC e to them. Once there, Persephone said she would be glad to do Aphrodite a favor. She once more paid Charon, threw the cake out to the hands, and gave one to Cerberus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Psyche left the underworld and decided to open the box and take a little bit of the beauty for herself, thinking that if she did so Eros would surely love her. Inside was a "Stygian sleep" which ov
2 CONC ertook her. Eros, who had forgiven her, flew to her body and wiped the sleep from her eyes, then begged Zeus and Aphrodite for their consent to his wedding of Psyche. They agreed and Zeus made her imm
2 CONC ortal. Aphrodite danced at the wedding of Eros and Psyche and their subsequent child was named Pleasure, or (in the Roman mythology) Volupta.
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Adonis</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aphrodite was Adonis' lover and had a part in his birth. She urged Myrrha or Smyrna to commit incest with her father, Theias, the King of Assyria. Another version says Myrrha's father was Cinyras o
2 CONC f Cyprus. Myrrha's nurse helped with the scheme. When Theias discovered this, he flew into a rage, chasing his daughter with a knife. The gods turned her into a myrrh tree and Adonis eventually sprang
2 CONC  from this tree. Alternatively, Aphrodite turned her into a tree and Adonis was born when Theias shot the tree with an arrow or when a boar used its tusks to tear the tree's bark off.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Once Adonis was born, Aphrodite took him under her wing, seducing him with the help of Helene, her friend, and was entranced by his unearthly beauty. She gave him to Persephone to watch over, but P
2 CONC ersephone was also amazed at his beauty and refused to give him back. The argument between the two goddesses was settled either by Zeus or Calliope, with Adonis spending four months with Aphrodite, fo
2 CONC ur months with Persephone and four months of the years with whomever he chose. He always chose Aphrodite because Persephone was the cold, unfeeling goddess of the underworld.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Adonis was eventually killed by a jealous Ares. Aphrodite was warned of this jealousy and was told that Adonis would be killed by a bull that Ares transformed into. She tried to persuade Adonis to 
2 CONC stay with her at all times, but his love of hunting was his downfall. While Adonis was hunting, Ares found him and gored him to death. Aphrodite arrived just in time to hear his last breath.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It is also said that Aphrodite bore a daughter to Adonis, Beroe.</p>

2 CONT <p>The Judgement of Paris</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of Achilles). Only the goddess Eris (Discord) was not invited, but she arri
2 CONC ved with a golden apple inscribed with the words "to the fairest," which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed the apple, and the matter was put before Paris, a passin
2 CONC g shepherd, who later turned out to be a prince of Troy. Hera tried to bribe Paris with the Asia Minor, while Athena offered for him to be the wisest mortal alive, but Aphrodite was judged most beauti
2 CONC ful when she offered Paris the most beautiful mortal woman as a wife. This woman was Helen, and her abduction by Paris led to the Trojan War.
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pygmalion and Galatea</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pygmalion was a sculptor who had never found a woman worthy of his love. Aphrodite took pity on him and decided to show him the wonders of love. One day, Pygmalion was inspired by a dream of Aphrod
2 CONC ite to make a woman out of ivory resembling her image, and he called her Galatea. He fell in love with the statue and decided he could not live without her. He prayed to Aphrodite, who carried out the
2 CONC  final phase of her plan and brought the exquisite sculpture to life. Pygmalion loved Galatea and they were soon married.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Another version of this myth tells that the women of the village in which Pygmalion lived grew angry that he had not married. They all asked Aphrodite to force him to marry. Aphrodite accepted and 
2 CONC went that very night to Pygmalion, and asked him to pick a woman to marry. She told him that if he did not pick one, she would do so for him. Not wanting to be married, he begged her for more time, as
2 CONC king that he be allowed to make a sculpture of Aphrodite before he had to choose his bride. Flattered, she accepted.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pygmalion spent a lot of time making small clay sculptures of the Goddess, claiming it was needed so he could pick the right pose. As he started making the actual sculpture he was shocked to discov
2 CONC er he actually wanted to finish, even though he knew he would have to marry someone when he finished. The reason he wanted to finish it was that he had fallen in love with the sculpture. The more he w
2 CONC orked on it, the more it changed, until it no longer resembled Aphrodite at all.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the very moment Pygmalion stepped away from the finished sculpture Aphrodite appeared and told him to choose his bride. Pygmalion chose the statue. Aphrodite told him that could not be, and aske
2 CONC d him again to pick a bride. Pygmalion put his arms around the statue, and asked Aphrodite to turn him into a statue so he could be with her. Aphrodite took pity on him and brought the statue to life 
2 CONC instead.

2 CONT <p>Other Stories</p>

2 CONT <p>In one version of the story of Hippolytus, Aphrodite was the catalyst for his death. He scorned the worship of Aphrodite for Artemis and, in revenge, Aphrodite caused his step-mother, Phaedra, to f

2 CONT <p>In book III of Homer's Iliad, Aphrodite saves Paris when he is about to be killed by Menelaos.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aphrodite was very protective of her son, Aeneas, who fought in the Trojan War. Diomedes almost killed Aeneas in battle but Aphrodite saved him. Diomedes wounded Aphrodite and she dropped her son, 
2 CONC fleeing to Mt. Olympus. Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by Artemis, who took him to Pergamos, a sacred spot in Troy. Apollo healed Aeneas there.

2 CONT <p>You can help Wikipedia by introducing appropriate citations.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In many modern Neopagan sects, Aphrodite takes on the role of the goddess of passion. Not all passion Aphrodite inspires is lustful, much of it is believed to take the form of artistic passion and 
2 CONC even passion in argument. Worship of Aphrodite is uncommon and is typically held by individual writers and artists. How she is worshipped often depends on what other gods a sect includes. For example,
2 CONC  sects that worship Hera and/or Themis may include worship of Aphrodite, but encourage monogamy and stress her role in committed relationships and marriage. Sects that worship Dionysus and Aphrodite m
2 CONC ay be entirely hedonistic and include orgiastic rituals (such sects are often considered cults even by Neopagan standards). As such worship of Aphrodite varies between sects.

2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Poseidon (Greek: Ποσειδῶν; Latin: Neptūnus) was the god of the sea and, as "Earth-Shaker," of earthquakes. The name of the god Nethuns in Etruscan was adopted in Latin
2 CONC  for Neptune in Roman mythology: both were sea gods analogous to Poseidon. Linear B tablets show that Poseidon was venerated at Pylos and Thebes in pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, but he was integrate
2 CONC d into the Olympian gods as the brother of Zeus and Hades.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon was a major civic god of several cities: in Athens, he was second only to Athena in importance; while in Corinth and many cities of Magna Graecia he was the chief god of the polis. In his 
2 CONC benign aspect, Poseidon was seen as creating new islands and offering calm seas. When offended or ignored, he supposedly struck the ground with his trident and caused chaotic springs, earthquakes, dro
2 CONC wnings and shipwrecks. Sailors prayed to Poseidon for a safe voyage, sometimes drowning horses as a sacrifice.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Pausanias, Poseidon was one of the caretakers of the oracle at Delphi before Olympian Apollo took it over. Apollo and Poseidon worked closely in many realms: in colonization, for examp
2 CONC le, Delphic Apollo provided the authorization to go out and settle, while Poseidon watched over the colonists on their way, and provided the lustral water for the foundation-sacrifice. Xenophon's Anab
2 CONC asis describes a group of Spartan soldiers in 400-399 BCE singing to Poseidon a paean - a kind of hymn normally sung for Apollo.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Like Dionysus, who inflamed the maenads, Poseidon also caused certain forms of mental disturbance. A Hippocratic text of ca 400 BCE, On the Sacred Disease says that he was blamed for certain types 
2 CONC of epilepsy.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The name seems to rather transparently stem from Greek pósis "lord, husband" with a less-transparent -don element, perhaps from dea, "goddess'. If surviving Linear B clay tablets can be trusted, t
2 CONC he name PO-SE-DA-WO-NE ("Poseidon") occurs with greater frequency than does DI-U-JA (Zeus). A feminine variant, PO-SE-DE-IA, is also found, indicating a lost consort goddess, in effect a precursor of 
2 CONC Amphitrite. Tablets from Pylos record sacrificial goods destined for "the Two Queens and Poseidon" and to "the Two Queens and the King". The most obvious identification for the "Two Queens" is with De
2 CONC meter and Persephone, or their precursors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods. Poseidon is already identified as "Earth-Shaker"— E-NE-SI-DA-O-NE— in Mycenaean Knossos
2 CONC , a powerful attribute where earthquakes had accompanied the collapse of the Minoan palace-culture. In the heavily sea-dependent Mycenean culture, no connection between Poseidon and the sea has yet su
2 CONC rfaced; among the Olympians it was determined by lot that he should rule over the sea (Hesiod, Theogony 456): the god preceded his realm.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demeter and Poseidon's names are linked in one Pylos tablet, where they appear as PO-SE-DA-WO-NE and DA, referred to by the epithets Enosichthon, Seischthon and Ennosigaios, all meaning "earth-shak
2 CONC er" and referring to his role in causing earthquakes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon was a son of Cronus and Rhea. In most accounts he is swallowed by Cronus at birth but later saved, with his other brothers and sisters, by Zeus.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However in some versions of the story, he, like his brother Zeus, did not share the fate of his other brother and sisters who were eaten by Cronus. He was saved by his mother Rhea, who concealed hi
2 CONC m among a flock of lambs and pretended to have given birth to a colt, which she gave to Cronus to devour. According to John Tzetzes the kourotrophos, or nurse of Poseidon was Arne, who denied knowing 
2 CONC where he was, when Cronus came searching; according to Diodorus Siculus Poseidon was raised by the Telchines on Rhodes, just as Zeus was raised by the Korybantes on Crete.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to a single reference in the Iliad, when the world was divided by lot in three, Zeus received the sky, Hades the underworld and Poseidon the sea.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athena became the patron goddess of the city of Athens after a competition with Poseidon. Yet Poseidon remained a numinous presence on the Acropolis in the form of his surrogate, Erechtheus. At the
2 CONC  dissolution festival at the end of the year in the Athenian calendar, the Skira, the priests of Athena and the priest of Poseidon would process under canopies to Eleusis. They agreed that each would 
2 CONC give the Athenians one gift and the Athenians would choose whichever gift they preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and a spring sprang up; the water was salty and not very useful, w
2 CONC hereas Athena offered them an olive tree.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Athenians (or their king, Cecrops) accepted the olive tree and along with it Athena as their patron, for the olive tree brought wood, oil and food. After the fight, infuriated at his loss, Pose
2 CONC idon sent a monstrous flood to the Attic Plain, to punish the Athenians for not choosing him. The depression made by Poseidon's trident and filled with salt water was surrounded by the northern hall o
2 CONC f the Erechtheum, remaining open to the air. "In cult, Poseidon was identified with Erechtheus," Walter Burkert noted. "the myth turns this into a temporal-causal sequence: in his anger at losing, Pos
2 CONC eidon led his son Eumolpus against Athens and killed Erectheus."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The contest of Athena and Poseidon was the subject of the reliefs on the western pediment of the Parthenon, the first sight that greeted the arriving visitor.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This myth is construed by Robert Graves and others as reflecting a clash between the inhabitants during Mycenaean times and newer immigrants. It is interesting to note that Athens at its height was
2 CONC  a significant sea power, at one point defeating the Persian fleet at Salamis Island in a sea battle
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon and Apollo, having offended Zeus, were sent to serve King Laomedon of Troy. He had them build huge walls around the city and promised to reward them well, a promise he then refused to fulf
2 CONC ill. In vengeance, before the Trojan War, Poseidon sent a sea monster to attack Troy (it was later killed by Perseus).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His consort was Amphitrite, a nymph and ancient sea-goddess, daughter of Nereus and Doris.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon was the father of many heroes. He is thought to have fathered the famed Theseus.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A mortal woman named Tyro was married to Cretheus (with whom she had one son, Aeson) but loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon, filled with lu
2 CONC st for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus, and from their union were born the heroes Pelias and Neleus, twin boys. Poseidon also had an affair with Alope, his granddaughter through Cercyon, begetting 
2 CONC the Attic hero Hippothoon. Cercyon had his daughter buried alive but Poseidon turned her into the spring, Alope, near Eleusis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon rescued Amymone from a lecherous satyr and then fathered a child, Nauplius, by her.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After having raped Caeneus, Poseidon fulfilled her request and changed her into a male warrior.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Not all of Poseidon's children were human. In an archaic myth, Poseidon once pursued Demeter. She spurned his advances, turning herself into a mare so that she could hide in a herd of horses; he sa
2 CONC w through the deception and became a stallion and captured her. Their child was a horse, Arion, which was capable of human speech. Poseidon also had sexual intercourse with Medusa on the floor of a te
2 CONC mple to Athena.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Medusa was then changed into a monster by Athena. When she was later beheaded by the hero Perseus, Chrysaor and Pegasus emerged from her neck. There is also Triton, the merman; Polyphemus, the cycl
2 CONC ops; and Oto and Ephialtae, the giants.

1 NOTE Poseidon 
2 CONT <p>Havets gud, även kallad Jordskakaren, eftersom han också ansågs orsaka jordbävningar. Poseidon var son till Kronos och Rhea, och var bror till Zeus och Hades. Han var Amfitrites make, och med h
2 CONC enne hade han sonen Triton. Han hade ockå barn med sina många älskarinnor, till exempel cykloperna, Pegasus, Theseus och Orion.
2 CONT <p>Ursprungligen var Poseidon vattnets gud, men han blev senare en havsgud och flodernas och källorna yttersta härskare. Hans tempel låg ofta nära havet, och ruinerna av ett kan ses i Kap Sounion,
2 CONC  inte långt ifrån Athen. Han var också Jonernas beskyddare.
2 CONT <p>I konsten avbildades Poseidon med en treudd och hans djur var delfinen.</p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon var också hästarnas gud, och de antika grekerna offrade hästar åt honom och sänkte dem i havet. Han var också associerad med tjurar.  Under det trojanska kriget stod han på grekerna
2 CONC s sida eftersom en av Trojas kungar hade vägrat betala honom då han byggt stadens mur. Han var dock Odysseus fiende efter att denne dödat hans son Polyfemos cyklopen.
2 CONT <p>Poseidon hade velat bli Athens skyddsgud, och i en tävling mot Athena hade han gett athenarna en källa, som tyvärr visade sig vara salt. Han förlorade därmed mot Athena, som gett folket olivtr

2 CONT <p>Poseidón era un importante dios municipal de varias ciudades: en Atenas, era el segundo en importancia por detrás solo de Atenea, mientras en Corinto y en muchas ciudades de la Magna Grecia era e
2 CONC l dios jefe de la polis.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En su aspecto benigno, Poseidón se concebía creando nuevas islas y ofreciendo mares en calma. Cuando se enfadaba o era ignorado, hendía el suelo con su tridente y provocaba manantiales caóticos
2 CONC , terremotos, hundimientos y naufragios. En La Odisea
2 CONT <p>, su rencor hacia Odiseo impidió a éste regresar a su hogar en Ítaca. Los marineros oraban a Poseidón para tener un viaje seguro, a veces ahogando caballos como sacrificio.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Según Pausanias, Poseidón fue uno de los guardianes del oráculo de Delfos antes de que el olímpico Apolo le sustituyese. Apolo y Poseidón colaboraban estrechamente en muchos ámbitos: en la co
2 CONC lonización, por ejemplo, Apolo Délfico daba la autoriza
2 CONT <p>ción para partir y asentarse, mientras Poseidón cuidaba de los colonizadores en su viaje y proporcionaba el agua purificadora para el sacrificio fundacional. En su Anábasis, Jenofonte describen 
2 CONC a un grupo de soldados espartanos en 400–399 adC can
2 CONT <p>tando un peán a Poseidón, un tipo de himno destinado normalmente a Apolo.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Como Dioniso, que enfervorizaba a las Ménades, Poseidón también provocaba ciertas formas de perturbación mental. Un texto hipocrático de c. 400 adC, Sobre la enfermedad sagrada, afirma que era
2 CONC  considerado culpable de ciertos tipos de epilepsia.

2 CONT <p>Prehistoria editar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>El nombre «Poseidón» parece proceder bastante claramente del griego pósis, ‘señor’, ‘marino’, con un elemento -don menos claro, quizá de dea, ‘diosa’. Si se da crédito a las tabl
2 CONC illas en lineal B que se conservan, el nombre PO-SE-DA-WO-NE (Poseid
2 CONT <p>ón) aparece con mayor frecuencia que DI-U-JA (Zeus). También aparece una variante femenina, PO-SE-DE-IA, lo que indica la existencia de una diosa consorte olvidada, precursora en efecto de Anfít
2 CONC rite. Las tablillas de Pilos registran mercancías de
2 CONT <p>stinadas a sacrificios para «las Dos Reinas y Poseidón» y «las Dos Reinas y el Rey». La identificación más obvia para las «Dos Reinas» es con Deméter y Perséfone o sus precursoras, diosa
2 CONC sque no quedaron asociadas con Poseidón en periodos posteri
2 CONT <p>ores. Poseidón es también identificado como E-NE-SI-DA-O-NE (‘agitador de la tierra’) en el Cnosos micénico,1 un poderoso atributo donde los terremotos habían acompañado al colapso de la c
2 CONC ultura palaciega minoica. En la cultura micénica, fuerteme

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Los nombres de Deméter y Poseidón están relacionados en una tablilla de Pilos, donde aparecen como PO-SE-DA-WO-NE y DA-MA-TE, en el contexto sagrado de echar a suertes. En una etimología,cita r
2 CONC equerida el elemento DA que aparece en ambos nombres
2 CONT <p> estaría relacionado con una raíz protoindoeuropea relacionada con la distribución de tierras y honores (compárese con el latín dare, ‘dar’), por lo que «Poseidón» significaría aproxim
2 CONC adamente ‘señor distribuidor’ o ‘consorte de la distribuidora’
2 CONT <p>, en correspondencia con «Deméter», ‘madre distribuidora’. Walter Burkert considera que «el segundo elemento DA permanece desesperadamente ambiguo» y encuentra la interpretación ‘consor
2 CONC tede la Tierra’ «bastante imposible de demostrar».3
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dada la relación de Poseidón con los caballos así como con el mar, y la alejada situación respecto al mar del probable territorio original indoeuropeo, algunos investigadores han propuesto que 
2 CONC Poseidón era originalmente un aristocrático dios-caba
2 CONT <p>llo que fue posteriormente asimilado con las deidades acuáticas de Oriente Próximo cuando la base del sustento griego cambió de la tierra al mar.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En cualquier caso, la enorme importancia inicial de Poseidón puede aún entreverse en La Odisea de Homero, donde es él y no Zeus el principal causante de los sucesos.</p>

2 CONT <p>Poseidón era un hijo de Crono y Rea. En la mayoría de las versiones fue tragado por Crono al nacer, pero algunas, al igual que Zeus, evitó el destino de sus demás hermanos al ser salvado por su
2 CONC  madre, que le ocultó en un rebaño de corderos simula
2 CONT <p>ndo haber parido un potro, que dio a Crono para que lo devorase.4 Según Tzetzés la curótrofa o niñera de Poseidón fue Arne, quien negó serlo cuando Crono apareció buscándola.5 Según Diodor

2 CONT <p> igual que Zeus había sido criado por los Coribantes en Creta.6</p>

2 CONT <p>La fundación de Atenas editar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Atenea se convirtió en la diosa patrona de la ciudad de Atenas tras competir con Poseidón. Ambos acordaron que cada uno haría un regalo a los atenienses y que éstos elegirían el que prefiriese
2 CONC n. Poseidón golpeó el suelo con su tridente e hizo bro
2 CONT <p>tar una fuente, pero su agua era salada y por tanto no muy útil, mientras que Atenea ofreció un olivo.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Los atenienses (o mejor dicho su rey, Cécrope) escogieron el olivo y con él a Atenea como patrona, pues el árbol daba madera, aceite y alimento. Tras esto, enfurecido por su derrota, Poseidón e
2 CONC nvió una monstruosa inundación a la llanura ática, ca
2 CONT <p>stigando así a los atenienses.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Este mito es considerado por Graves y otros autores como el reflejo de un enfrentamiento entre los habitantes de la época micénica y los inmigrantes posteriores. Resulta interesante señalar que 
2 CONC en su culmen Atenas fue una importante potencia marí
2 CONT <p>tima, llegando a derrotar a la flota persa en la batalla de Salamina. Otra versión del mito cuenta que Poseidón dio caballos a Atenas.</p>

2 CONT <p>Su esposa era Anfítrite, una ninfa y antigua diosa del mar, hija de Nereo y Doris. Poseidón fue padre de muchos héroes, entre ellos el afamado Teseo.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Una mujer mortal llamada Tiro estaba casada con Creteo (con quien tenía un hijo, Aesón) pero amaba a Enipeo, un dios-río. Tiro perseguía a Enipeo, que rehuía sus avances. Un día Poseidón,lle
2 CONC no de deseo hacia Tiro, se disfrazó como Enipeo y de su
2 CONT <p> unión con ella nacieron los héroes Pelias y Neleo. Poseidón también tuvo una aventura con Álope, su nieta por Cerción, de la que nació el héroe ático Hipotoonte. Cerción enterró viva a 
2 CONC su hija pero Poseidón la convirtió en una fuente cerca de El
2 CONT <p>eusis.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidón rescató a Amimone de un sátiro lujurioso y entonces tuvo un hijo con ella, Nauplio. Tras violar a Cene, Poseidón le concedió el deseo de convertirse en hombre.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>No todos los hijos de Poseidón fueron humanos. En un mito arcaico, Poseidón persiguió una vez a Deméter. Ésta rechazó sus avances, transformándose en una yegua para poder esconderse en unreb
2 CONC año de caballos, pero Poseidón advirtió el engaño, se c
2 CONT <p>onvirtió en un semental y la raptó. El hijo de ambos fue un caballo, Arión, que tenía el don de la palabra. Poseidón también violó a Medusa en el suelo de un templo consagrado a Atenea. Medu
2 CONC sa fue entonces transformada en un monstruo. Cuando más
2 CONT <p> tarde fue decapitada por Perseo, Crisaor y Pegaso emergieron de su cuello. Otros descendientes de Poseidón fueron Tritón, el cíclope Polifemo y los Alóadas.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidón se enamoró de Pélope, un hermoso joven, hijo de Tántalo. Llevó a Pélope al Olimpo y le hizo su amante, antes incluso de que Zeus hiciese lo mismo con Ganimedes. Para agradecer a Pél

2 CONT <p>En el arte griego, Poseidón conduce un carro tirado por un Hipocampo o por caballos que podían cabalgar sobre el mar. Estaba asociado con los delfines y las lanzas de pescar de tres dientes (trid

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En La Odisea, Poseidón destaca por su odio hacia Odiseo, debido a que éste había cegado a su hijo el cíclope Polifemo. La enemistad del dios impide a Odiseo volver a su hogar en Ítaca durante

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ciumenta e agressiva, sempre odiou e perseguiu as amantes de Zeus e os filhos de tais relacionamentos, tanto que tentou matar Hércules quando este era apenas um bebê. O único filho de Zeus que e

2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>Dans la mythologie grecque, Héra ou Héré (en grec ancien (Attique) Ἥρα / Hêra ou en ionien Ἥρη / Hêrê), fille des Titans Cronos et Rhéa, est la femme et la sœur de Zeus. C´est auss
2 CONC i la sœur de Déméter, d´Hadès, de Poséidon et d´Héstia. Elle est la protectrice par excellence de la femme et la déesse du mariage légitime, gardienne de la fécondité du couple et des femm
2 CONC es en couches. Elle est très jalouse des infidélités de son mari Zeus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Elle correspond à Junon dans la mythologie romaine.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Fille de Rhéa et de Cronos1, elle est dès sa naissance avalée par son père2. Elle est libérée par son frère Zeus en même temps que tous ses frères.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Après la Titanomachie, Héra devient l'épouse de Zeus3. Elle est la mère, par Zeus, d'Arès, d'Hébé et d'Ilithyie4, mais aussi d'Héphaïstos, qu'elle conçoit seule pour défier son mari et l
2 CONC ui montrer qu'elle n'a pas besoin de lui pour enfanter5. Homère (Il. i. 578, xiv. 338, xviii. 396, xxi. 332, Od. viii. 312) et Cicéron (De Natura Deorum 3.22) font néanmoins d'Héphaïstos le fils 
2 CONC de Zeus et d'Héra.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Les traditions post-hésiodiques attribuent à Zeus et Héra de nombreux autres enfants absents des catalogues « traditionnels » : Quintus de Smyrne, dans ses Posthomériques, leur reconnaît ain
2 CONC si trois filles supplémentaires : la Charite Pasithée et les déesses guerrières Ényo et Éris (la Discorde). Le pseudo-Hygin, dans la préface de ses Fables, mentionne également parmi leurs enfa
2 CONC nts la Liberté. Enfin, les Scholia Theocrite citent le mimographe Sophron, qui dans un écrit intitulé Angélos nomme ainsi une fille méconnue de Zeus et d'Héra, plus ou moins identique à Hécate
2 CONC .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Alors que la grande majorité des mythes liés à Héra portent sur sa jalousie vis-à-vis des nombreuses aventures de Zeus, des récits minoritaires s'intéressent aux premiers moments du couple d
2 CONC ivin. L'Iliade fait ainsi allusion à la première fois où Zeus et Héra s'unissent, à l'insu de leurs parents6. Une scholie précise qu'Héra est fiancée à Zeus par Océan et Téthys après que C
2 CONC ronos a été envoyé au Tartare ; en secret, les deux fiancés s'unissent sur l'île de Samos. Héra donne naissance à Héphaïstos et, pour cacher sa honte, prétend qu'il est né sans père7. Une 
2 CONC autre scholie indique qu'Héra est violée par le Géant Eurymédon alors qu'elle se trouve encore chez ses parents8. Dans une autre version encore, Héra se trouve au mont Thornax (appelé depuis le 
2 CONC « mont des Coucous »), lorsque son frère, Zeus, la rejoint, métamorphosé en coucou9.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Héra est le plus souvent présentée comme une épouse jalouse, qui se plaît à persécuter les maîtresses de Zeus et leur progéniture10. Parmi ses victimes, Héraclès, auquel elle dépêche d
2 CONC eux serpents11, et la nymphe Io, transformée en vache par Zeus pour la protéger mais malgré tout rendue folle par les piqûres d'un taon envoyé par Héra12. Elle se venge aussi en contrecarrant le
2 CONC s desseins de son époux, provoquant d'incessantes querelles.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Déesse du mariage légitime, elle n'a aucun amant10. Elle est pourtant désirée par Ixion, qui s'unit avec un nuage croyant, qu'il s'agit d'elle13, ainsi que par Endymion. Selon une tradition min
2 CONC oritaire14, elle est assaillie par le géant Eurymédon et en conçoit Prométhée, d'où sans doute le médaillon de coupe de Douris représentant Héra assise face à ce dernier (voir ci-contre).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Un jour, exaspérée des incartades de Zeus, Héra décide de demander l'aide de ses fils pour punir le dieu volage. Ils projettent de ligoter Zeus pendant son sommeil avec des lanières de cuir po

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Offensée par le jugement de Pâris, qui lui préfère Aphrodite, elle se montre la plus farouche ennemie des Troyens pendant la guerre de Troie et contribue au sac de la ville.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lorsqu'elle se dispute avec Zeus pour savoir quel sexe connaît le plus de plaisir lors d'une relation sexuelle, elle accepte que le devin Tirésias, qui avait été femme puis homme, juge la quere
2 CONC lle. Mais lorsque celui-ci donne raison à Zeus, elle se venge en le frappant de cécité.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Franz Rolf Schröder16 avait avancé qu’il fallait rapprocher le nom d’Héra du nom indo-européen de l’année *yērā-, présents en anglais year, allemand Jahr… Jean Haudry dans son essai
2 CONC  La religion cosmique des Indo-européens (Archè, 1987) précise le sens de *yērā- comme la belle saison de l’année, comparables au grec et vieux russe jarǔ, printemps, belle saison. Cette éty
2 CONC mologie révèle la nature originelle de la déesse, la signification de son union avec Zeus interprété comme Ciel-diurne : c’est le retour de la partie claire de l’année. L’Héra porteuse de
2 CONC  vie d’Empédocle est « celle qui apporte une récolte abondante ».
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Héra est la personnification féminine de la belle saison. Ce n’est que par la suite que son union avec Zeus est interprétée comme le prototype de l’union légitime. Sa couleur symbolique es
2 CONC t la couleur blanche theá leukốlenos, déesse aux bras blancs, divinité d’élection d’Argos « la ville blanche ». Si Héra est liée au symbolisme de la vache blanche, c’est dans la mesure
2 CONC  où cet animal est symbole de prospérité et d’abondance. Héra est enfin liée aux Heures, ces divinités du retour du printemps et enfin aux héros dont le prototype est Héraclès celui qui a l
2 CONC a gloire d’Héra. Le héros ainsi, selon Haudry, est celui qui né mortel, conquérant la belle saison de l’année échappe à la mort.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Héra est également la déesse du et des épouses, protectrice du couple, de la fécondité et des femmes en couches — domaine qu'elle partage avec sa fille Ilithye. Sous son épiclèse de ὁπ

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Elle est surtout vénérée à Argos, citée par Homère comme une ville chère à la déesse, à l'instar de Mycènes et Sparte. Elle possède également un temple à Olympie, à Corinthe, à Samo

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Io pron.: /ˈaɪ.oʊ/ (Ancient Greek: Ἰώ [iːɔ̌ː]) was, in Greek mythology, a priestess of Hera in Argos,[1] a nymph who was seduced by Zeus, who changed her into a heifer to esc
2 CONC ape detection. His wife Hera sent ever-watchful Argus Panoptes, with 100 eyes, to guard her, but Hermes was sent to distract the guardian and slay him. Heifer Io was loosed to roam the world, stung by
2 CONC  a maddening gadfly sent by Hera, and wandered to Egypt, thus placing her descendant Belus in Egypt; his sons Cadmus and Danaus would then "return" to mainland Greece.
