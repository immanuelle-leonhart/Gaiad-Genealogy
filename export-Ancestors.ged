2 CONT Emperor Keikō (景行天皇, Keikō-tennō), also known as Ootarashihikooshirowake no Sumeramikoto (大足彦忍代別天皇) and Ōtarashihiko-oshirowake no Mikoto (大帯日子淤斯呂和氣天皇), was the 12th legendary Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order o
2 CONC f succession.[4][5] Both the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki (collectively known as the Kiki) record events that took place during Keikō's alleged lifetime. Keikō was recorded as being an exceptionally tall emperor who had a very larg
2 CONC e family. During his reign he sought to expand territorial control through conquest of local tribes. He had a very important son named "Prince Ōsu" (Yamato Takeru), who was in possession of the Kusanagi when he died. This treasure
2 CONC  was later moved to Atsuta Shrine, and is now a part of the Imperial Regalia of Japan. There is a possibility that Keikō actually lived or reigned in the 4th century AD rather than the 1st, but more information is needed to confir
2 CONC m this view.
2 CONT
2 CONT Keikō's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 71 to 130 AD.[6] During his alleged lifetime, he fathered at least 80 children with two chief wives (empress) and nine consorts. One of his sons became the next emperor 
2 CONC upon his death in 130 AD, but the location of Keikō's grave (if any) is unknown. Keikō is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb (misasagi) at Nara.

2 CONT ... 封子棠為樂平侯，棠弟雍乘氏侯，雍弟翟單父侯 ...
2 CONT
2 CONT 商字伯夏，雍之子也。少以外戚拜郎中，遷黃門侍郎。永建元年，襲父封乘氏侯。三年，順帝選商女及妹入掖庭，遷侍中、屯騎校尉。陽嘉元年，女立為皇后，妹為貴人，加商位特進，更增國土，賜安車駟馬，其歲拜執金吾。二年，封子冀為襄邑侯，商讓不受。三年，以商為大將軍，固稱疾不起。四年，使太常桓焉奉策就第即拜，商乃詣闕受命。明年，夫人陰氏薨，追號開封君，贈印綬。
2 CONT
2 CONT 商自以戚屬居大位，每存謙柔，虛己進賢，辟漢陽巨覽、上黨陳龜為椽屬。李固、周舉為從事中郎，於是京師翕然，稱為良輔，帝委重焉。每有饑饉，輒載租谷於城門，賑與貧餧，不宣己惠。檢禦門族，未曾以權盛幹法。而性慎弱無威斷，頗溺於內豎。以小黃門曹節等用事於中，遂遣子冀、不疑與為交友，然宦者忌商寵任，反俗陷之。永和四年，中常侍張逵、蘧政，內者令石光，尚方令傅福，冗從僕射杜永連謀，共譖商及中常侍曹騰、孟賁，雲欲征諸王子，圖議廢立，請收商等案罪。帝曰：『大將軍父子我所親，騰、
2 CONC 賁我所愛，必無是，但汝曹共妒之耳。』逵等知言不用，懼迫，遂出矯詔收縛騰、賁於省中。
2 CONT
2 CONT 帝聞震怒，敕宦者李歙急呼騰、賁釋之，收逵等，悉伏誅。辭所連染及在位大臣，商懼多侵枉，乃上疏曰：『《春秋》之義，功在元帥，罪止首惡，故賞不僭溢，刑不淫濫，五帝、三王所以同致康乂也。竊聞考中常侍張逵等，辭語多所牽及。大獄一起，無辜者眾，死囚久系，纖微成大，非所以順迎和氣，平政成化也。宜早訖竟，以止逮捕之煩。』帝乃納之，罪止坐者。
2 CONT
2 CONT 六年秋，商病篤，敕子冀等曰：『吾以不德，享受多福。生無以輔益朝廷，死必耗廢帑臧，衣衾飯唅玉匣珠貝之屬，何益朽骨。百僚勞擾，紛華道路，秖增塵垢，雖雲禮制，亦有權時。方今邊境不寧，盜賊未息，豈宜重為國損！氣絕之後，載至冢舍，即時殯斂。斂以時服，皆以故衣，無更裁製。殯已開冢，冢開即葬。祭食如存，無用三牲。孝子善述父誌，不宜違我言也。』及薨，帝親臨喪，諸子欲從其誨，朝廷不聽，賜以東園朱壽器、銀鏤、黃腸、玉匣、什物二十八種，錢二百萬，布三千匹。皇后錢五百萬，布萬匹。
2 CONC 及葬，贈輕車介士，賜謚忠侯。中宮親送，帝幸宣陽亭，瞻望車騎。

2 CONT Emperor Sujin (崇神天皇, Sujin-tennō), also known as Mimakiirihikoinie no Mikoto (御眞木入日子印恵命) in the Kojiki, and Mimakiiribikoinie no Sumeramikoto (御間城入彦五十瓊殖天皇) or Hatsukunishirasu Sumeramikoto (御肇國天皇) in the Nihon Shoki was the tenth 
2 CONC Emperor of Japan.[4][5] While Sujin is the first emperor whose existence historians widely accept, he is still referred to as a "legendary emperor" due to a lack of information available and because dates for his reign vary.[6][7]
2 CONC  Both the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki (collectively known as the Kiki) record events that took place during Sujin's alleged lifetime. This legendary narrative tells how he set up a new shrine outside of the Imperial palace to ensh

2 CONC ō shogun.
2 CONT
2 CONT This Emperor's reign is conventionally assigned the years of 97 BC – 30 BC.[8][9] During his alleged lifetime, he fathered twelve children with a chief wife (empress) and two consorts. Sujin chose his future heir based on dreams t
2 CONC wo of his sons had; in this case, his younger son became Emperor Suinin upon Sujin's death in 30 BC. Like other emperors of this period, the location of Sujin's grave if it exists is unknown. He is traditionally venerated at the A

2 CONT 梁統字仲寧，安定烏氏人 ... 子松嗣。
2 CONT
2 CONT ... 松弟竦。
2 CONT
2 CONT 竦字叔敬，少習《孟習易》，弱冠能教授。後坐兄松事，與弟恭俱徙九真。既徂南土，歷江、湖，濟沅、湘，感悼子胥、屈原以非辜沈身，乃作《悼騷賦》，系玄石而沈之。
2 CONT
2 CONT 顯宗後詔聽還本郡。竦閉門自養，以經籍為娛，著書數篇，名曰《七序》。班固見而稱曰：『孔子著《春秋》而亂臣賊子懼，梁竦作《七序》而竊位素餐者慚。』姓好施，不事產業。長嫂舞陰公主贍給諸梁，親疏有序，特重敬竦，雖衣食器物，必有加異。竦悉分與親族，自無所服。
2 CONT
2 CONT 竦生長京師，不樂本土，身負其才，鬱鬱不得意。嘗登高遠望，嘆息言曰：『大丈夫居世，生當封侯，死當廟食。如其不然，閑居可以養誌，《詩》、《書》足以自娛，州郡之職，徒勞人耳。』後辟命交至，並無所就。有三男三女，肅宗納其二女，皆為貴人。小貴人生和帝，竇皇后養以為子，而竦家私相慶。後諸竇聞之，恐梁氏得誌，終為己害，建初八年，遂譖殺二貴人，而陷竦等以惡逆。詔使漢陽太守鄭據傳考竦罪，死獄中，家屬復徙九真。辭語連及舞陰公主，坐徙新城，使者護守。宮省事密，莫有知和帝梁氏生者
2 CONC 。
2 CONT
2 CONT 永元九年，竇太后崩，松子扈遣從兄禪奏記三府，以為漢家舊典，崇貴母氏，而梁貴人親育聖躬，不蒙尊號，求得申議。太尉張酺引禪訊問事理，會後召見，因白禪奏記之狀。帝感慟良久，曰：『於君意若何？』酺對曰：『《春秋》之義，母以子貴。漢興以來，母氏莫不降顯，臣愚以為宜上尊號，追慰聖靈，存錄諸舅，以明親親。』帝悲泣曰：『非君孰為朕思之！』會貴人姊南陽樊調妻嫕上書自訟曰：
2 CONT
2 CONT >>妾同產女弟貴人，前充後宮，蒙先帝厚恩，得見寵幸。皇天授命，誕生聖明。而為竇憲兄弟所見譖訴，使妾父竦冤死牢獄，骸骨不掩。老母孤弟，遠徙萬里。獨妾遺脫，逸伏草野，常恐沒命，無由自達。今遭值陛下神聖之運，親統萬機，群物得所。憲兄弟奸惡，既伏辜誅，海內曠然，各獲其宜。妾得蘇息，拭目更視，乃敢昧死自陳所天。妾聞太宗即位，薄氏蒙榮；宣帝繼統，史族復興。妾門雖有薄、史之親，獨無外戚餘恩，誠自悼傷。妾父既冤，不可復生，母氏年殊七十，乃弟棠等，遠在絕域，不知死生。願乞收
2 CONC 竦朽骨。使母、弟得歸本郡，則施過天地，存歿幸賴。
2 CONT
2 CONT 帝覽章感悟，乃下中常侍、掖庭令驗問之，嫕辭證明審，遂得引見，具陳其狀。乃留嫕止宮中，連月乃出，賞賜衣被錢帛第宅奴卑，旬月之間，累資千萬。嫕素有行操，帝益愛之，加號梁夫人；擢樊調為羽林左監。調，光祿大夫宏兄曾孫也。
2 CONT
2 CONT 於是追尊恭懷皇后。其冬，制詔三公、大鴻臚曰：『夫孝莫大於尊尊親親，其義一也。《詩》云：「父兮生我，母兮鞠我，撫我畜我，長我育我，顧我復我，出入腹我。欲報之德，昊天罔極。」朕不敢興事，覽於前世，太宗、中宗，實有舊典，追命外祖，以篤親親。其追封謚皇太后父竦為褒親湣侯，比靈文、順成、恩成侯。魂而有靈，嘉斯寵榮，好爵顯服，以慰母心。』遣中謁者與嫕及扈，備禮西迎竦喪，詣京師改殯，賜東園畫館、玉匣、衣衾，建塋於恭懷皇后陵傍。帝親臨送葬，百官畢會。
2 CONT
2 CONT 征還竦妻、子，封子棠為樂平侯，棠弟雍乘氏侯，雍弟翟單父侯，邑各五千戶，位皆特進，賞賜第宅、奴卑、車馬、兵弩、什物以巨萬計，寵遇光於當世。諸梁內外以親疏並補郎、謁者。
2 CONT
2 CONT 棠官至大鴻臚，雍少府。棠卒，子安國嗣，延光中為侍中，有罪免官，諸梁為郎吏者皆坐免。

2 CONC gwu (13 January 5 BC – 29 March 57),[3] born Liu Xiu, was an emperor of the Chinese Han Dynasty, restorer of the dynasty in AD 25 and thus founder of the Later Han or Eastern Han (the restored Han Dynasty). He ruled over parts of 
2 CONC China at first, and through suppression and conquest of regional warlords, the whole of China was consolidated by the time of his death in 57. Liu Xiu was one of the many descendants of the Han imperial family. Following the usurp
2 CONC ation of the Han throne by Wang Mang and the ensuing civil war during the disintegration of Wang's short-lived Xin Dynasty, he emerged as one of several descendants of the fallen dynasty claiming the imperial throne. After assembl
2 CONC ing forces and proclaiming himself emperor in the face of competitors, he was able to defeat his rivals, destroy the peasant army of the Chimei, known for their disorganization and marauding, and finally reunify the whole of China
2 CONC  in AD 36. He established his capital in Luoyang, 335 kilometers (208 mi) east of the former capital Chang'an, ushering in the Later/Eastern Han Dynasty. He implemented some reforms (notably land reform, albeit not very successful
2 CONC ly) aimed at correcting some of the structural imbalances responsible for the downfall of the Former/Western Han. His reforms gave a new 200-year lease on life to the Han Dynasty. Emperor Guangwu's campaigns featured many able gen
2 CONC erals, but curiously, he lacked major strategists. That may very well be because he himself appeared to be a brilliant strategist; he often instructed his generals as to strategy from afar, and his predictions generally would be a
2 CONC ccurate. This was often emulated by later emperors who fancied themselves great strategists but who actually lacked Emperor Guangwu's brilliance—usually to great disastrous results. Also unique among emperors in Chinese history wa
2 CONC s Emperor Guangwu's combination of decisiveness and mercy. He often sought out peaceful means rather than bellicose means of putting areas under his control. He was, in particular, one of the rare examples of a founding emperor of
2 CONC  a dynasty who did not kill, out of jealousy or paranoia, any of the generals or officials who contributed to his victories after his rule was secure.

2 CONT 梁統字仲寧，安定烏氏人，晉大夫梁益耳，即其先也。統高祖父子都，自河東遷居北地，子都子橋，以資千萬徙茂陵，至哀、平之末，歸安定。
2 CONT
2 CONT 統性剛毅而好法律。初仕州郡。更始二年，召補中郎將，使安集涼州，拜酒泉太守。會更始敗，赤眉入長安，統與竇融及諸郡守起兵保境，謀共立帥。初以位次，鹹共推統，統固辭曰：『昔陳嬰不受王者，以有老母也。今統內有尊親，又德薄能寡，誠不足以當之。』遂共推融為河西大將軍，更以統為武威大守。為政嚴猛，威行鄰郡。
2 CONT
2 CONT 建武五年，統籌各遣使隨竇融長史劉鈞詣闕奉貢，願得詣行在所，詔加統宣德將軍。八年夏，光武自征隗囂，統與竇融等將兵會車駕。及囂敗，封統為成義侯，同產兄巡、從弟騰並為關內侯，拜騰酒泉典農部尉，悉遣還河西。十二年，統與融等俱詣京師，以列侯奉朝請，更封高山侯，拜太中大夫，除四子為郎。
2 CONT
2 CONT 統在朝廷，數陳便宜。以為法令既輕，下奸不勝。宜重刑罰，以遵舊典，乃上疏曰：
2 CONT
2 CONT >>臣竊見元、哀二交輕殊死之刑以一百二十三事，手殺人者減死一等，自是以後，著為常準，故人輕犯法，吏易殺人。
2 CONT
2 CONT >>臣聞立君之道，仁義為主，仁者愛人，義者政理，愛人以除殘為務，政理以去亂為心。刑罰在衷，無取於勸，是以五帝有流、殛、放、殺之誅，三王有大辟、刻肌之法。故孔子稱『仁者必有勇』，又曰『理財正辭，禁民為非曰義』。高帝受命誅暴，平蕩天下，約令定律，誠得其宜。文帝寬惠柔克，遭世康平，惟除省肉刑、相坐之法，它皆率由，無革舊章。武帝值中國隆盛，財力有餘，征伐遠方，軍役數興，豪桀犯禁，奸吏弄法，故重首匿之科，著知從之律，以破朋黨，以懲隱匿。宣帝聰明正直，總禦海內，臣下奉
2 CONC 憲，無所失墜，因循先典，天下稱理。至哀、平繼體，而即位日淺，聽斷尚寡，丞相王嘉輕為穿鑿，虧除先帝舊約成律，數年之間，百有餘事，或不便於理，或不厭民心。謹表其尤害於體者傅奏於左。
2 CONT
2 CONT >>伏惟陛下包元履德，權時撥亂，功逾文、武，德侔高皇，誠不宜因循季末衰微之軌。回神明察，考量得失，宣詔有司，詳擇其善，定不易之典，施無窮之法，天下幸甚。
2 CONT
2 CONT >>事下三公、廷尉，議者以為隆刑竣法，非明王急務，施行日久，豈一朝所厘。統今所定，不宜開可。
2 CONT
2 CONT 統復上言曰：『有司以臣今所言，不可施行。尋臣之所奏，非曰嚴刑。竊謂高帝以後，至乎孝宣，其所施行，多合經傳，宜比方今事，驗之往古，聿遵前典，事無難改，不勝至願。願得召見，若對尚書近臣，口陳其要。』帝令尚書問狀，統對曰：
2 CONT
2 CONT 聞聖帝明王，制立刑罰，故雖堯、舜之盛，猶誅四兇。經曰：『天討有罪，五刑五庸哉。』又曰：『爰制百姓於刑之衷。』孔子曰：『刑罰不衷，則人無所厝手足。』衷之為言，不輕不重之謂也。《春秋》之誅，不避親戚，所以防患救亂，全安眾庶，豈無仁愛之恩？貴絕殘賊之路也。
2 CONT
2 CONT 自高祖之興，至於孝宣，君明臣忠，謨謀深博，猶因循舊章，不輕改革，海內稱理，斷獄益少。至初元、建平，所減刑罰百有餘條，而盜賊浸多，歲以萬數。間者三輔從橫，群輩並起，至燔燒茂陵，桂見未央。其後坤西、北地、西河之賊，越州度郡，萬里交結，攻取庫兵，劫略吏人，詔書討捕，連年不獲。是時以天下無難，百姓安平，而狂狡之勢，猶至於此，皆刑罰不衷，愚人易犯之所致也。
2 CONT
2 CONT 由此觀之，則刑輕之作，反生大患；惠加奸軌，而害及良善也。故臣統願陛下采擇賢臣孔光、師丹等議。議上，遂寢不報。
2 CONT
2 CONT 後出為九江太守，定封陵鄉侯。統在郡亦有治跡，吏人畏愛之。卒於官。子松嗣。

2 CONT Emperor Xuan was the great grandson of Emperor Wu. His grandfather Liu Ju, was the son of Emperor Wu and Empress Wei and the crown prince of the Han Empire, who in 91 BC was framed for witchcraft practice against Emperor Wu and co
2 CONC mmitted suicide after being forced into a failed uprising. His father Liu Jin (劉進) also died in that turmoil. Emperor Xuan was only an infant at the time and hence he was spared (but only barely) but was banished to live as a comm
2 CONC oner.
2 CONT
2 CONT After Emperor He's short reign of only 27 days in 74 BC, Xuan was declared emperor by Huo Guang (the half-brother of Huo Qubing). Emperor Xuan has been considered a hardworking and brilliant emperor. Because Xuan grew up as a comm
2 CONC oner, he thoroughly understood the suffering of his people. He lowered taxes, liberalized the government and employed capable ministers to the government. He was said by Liu Xiang to have been fond of reading Shen Buhai, using Xin
2 CONC g-Ming to control his subordinates and devoting much time to legal cases.[4][5] Emperor Xuan was open to suggestions, was a good judge of character, and consolidated his power by eliminating corrupt officials, including the Huo fa
2 CONC mily, which have exerted considerable power since the death of Emperor Wu, after Huo Guang's death. However, his execution of the entire Huo clan later drew heavy criticism from historians for its ungratefulness to Huo Guang. (e.g
2 CONC ., Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian.) Under Emperor Xuan, the Han dynasty prospered economically and militarily. His rule lasted 25 years and he died in 49 BC. He was succeeded by his son Emperor Yuan. Contents  [hide]  1	Family b

2 CONT Family background and early life Parentage, disaster, and a barely spared young life Liu Bingyi was born in 91 BC to Liu Jin, the son of then-Crown Prince Liu Ju, and his wife Consort Wang.[6][7] As the grandson of the Crown Princ
2 CONC e, Bingyi likely was born in Prince Ju's palace.
2 CONT
2 CONT That same year, however, disaster would strike. With conspirators accusing him of using witchcraft against his father Emperor Wu, Prince Ju was forced into a rebellion, which was defeated. Prince Ju committed suicide, and Bingyi's
2 CONC  two uncles died with him, although it was not clear whether they also committed suicide or were killed by soldiers. Bingyi's great-grandmother Empress Wei also committed suicide, and his grandmother (Prince Ju's concubine) Consor
2 CONC t Shi and his parents died in the incident as well in the capital Chang'an. It is not completely clear whether they took their own lives or were executed, but the latter seems likely.
2 CONT
2 CONT For reasons not completely clear, the baby Bingyi was spared, although he was imprisoned in a prison overseen by the Ministry of Vassal Affairs. He was put into the custody of the warden Bing Ji (丙吉). Bing knew that Prince Ju was 
2 CONC actually innocent of witchcraft and took pity on the child, and selected two kind female prisoners, Hu Zu (胡組) and Guo Zhengqing (郭徵卿) to serve as his wet nurses and caretakers. Bing visited them each day to see how the child was 
2 CONC doing.
2 CONT
2 CONT Childhood Near the end of Emperor Wu's reign, there was an incident when magicians claimed that an aura of an emperor was appearing from Chang'an prisons. Emperor Wu ordered that all prisoners, regardless of whether they had been 
2 CONC convicted or not and regardless of the severity of the charges, were to be executed. When the eunuch delivering the edict arrived at the Vassal Affairs prison that Bing oversaw, Bing refused to accept the edict, stating that no on
2 CONC e who had not been convicted of a capital crime should be executed, and particularly not the emperor's own great-grandson. The eunuch filed charges against Bing for refusing to abide by the edict—a capital offense—but by that time
2 CONC  Emperor Wu had realized his error and declared a general pardon. The prisoners in all other prisons were dead, but the prisoners at Bing's prison survived.
2 CONT
2 CONT However, this incident made Bing feel that it was inappropriate for the young Bingyi to remain at the prison, and so he ordered one of his lieutenants to transfer Bingyi and Hu (Guo might have died by this point) to the city gover
2 CONC nment of Chang'an. The city government refused to accept responsibility, and so Bing had to let them remain in prison. After Hu's sentence was over, Bing hired her out of his own pocket to continue to serve as a wet nurse for seve
2 CONC ral months, before letting her leave. Later, the budget for taking care of Bingyi was cut off from the imperial clan affairs budget, and Bing took money out of his own salary to care for Bingyi. When he grew somewhat older, Bing h
2 CONC eard that Consort Shi's mother Zhenjun (貞君) and brother Shi Gong (史恭) survived the incident, and so sought them out and had Bingyi delivered to the Shi residence. Lady Zhenjun raised him herself.
2 CONT
2 CONT Several years later, Bingyi's granduncle Emperor Zhao found out that Bingyi was alive, and ordered that the Ministry of Imperial Clan Affairs take over the duty for caring for Bingyi. The chief eunuch at the palace Zhang He (張賀), 
2 CONC who had been had previously been an advisor to Prince Ju before he was castrated by Emperor Wu in the aftermaths of Prince Ju's death, cared well for young Bingyi, and paid for his expenses and studies out of his own pocket.
2 CONT
2 CONT Young adulthood and marriage Circa 76 BC, Zhang wanted to marry his granddaughter to Bingyi, but his brother Zhang Anshi (張安世), then an important official, opposed, fearing that it would bring trouble. Zhang, instead, invited one 
2 CONC of his subordinate eunuchs (who had also been castrated by Emperor Wu), Xu Guanghan (許廣漢), to dinner, and persuaded him to marry his daughter Xu Pingjun to him. When Xu's wife heard this, she became extremely angry and refused, bu
2 CONC t because Zhang was Xu's superior, Xu did not dare to renege on the promise, and Bingyi and Pingjun were married, in a ceremony entirely paid by Zhang (because Bingyi could not afford to). Zhang also paid the bride price.
2 CONT
2 CONT After marriage, Bingyi depended on his wife's family and his grandmother's family for support, and he engaged a teacher to teach him the Confucian classics. He was a diligent learner, and he also had a strong sense of social justi
2 CONC ce. As a teenager, he had many friends from all walks of life and was able to see the dark sides of society and the suffering of the people at the hands of corrupt officials. He had a strong interest in hiking. Occasionally he was
2 CONC  summoned to see Emperor Zhao. Pingjun bore him a son, Liu Shi.
2 CONT
2 CONT Succession to the throne After Emperor Zhao died in 74 BC at the age of 20, the regent Huo Guang initially offered the throne to Prince He of Changyi. However, after Prince He quickly showed his unsuitability to be an emperor, Huo
2 CONC  removed him from the throne. Huo, however, could not find a suitable successor among the princes. At Bing's recommendation (although the exact process behind the scenes was not completely clear), Huo, with Zhang Anshi's concurren
2 CONC ce, decided to offer the throne to Bingyi, then 17, an offer ratified by Huo's granddaughter Empress Dowager Shangguan. To avoid having a mere commoner take the throne, 27 days after Prince He was removed from the throne, Empress 
2 CONC Dowager Shangguan first created him the Marquess of Yangwu. On the same day, he was offered the imperial seal and the throne, and he accepted.
2 CONT
2 CONT Early reign When Emperor Xuan accepted tHe throne, his son Prince Shi was barely a few months old. Prince Shi's mother Xu Pingjun was initially created a consort. When it came time to create an empress, the officials largely wante
2 CONC d Emperor Xuan to marry Huo Guang's daughter Huo Chengjun (霍成君) and create her empress. Emperor Xuan did not explicitly reject this proposal, but issued an order to seek out the sword that he owned as a commoner. Getting the hint,
2 CONC  the officials recommended Consort Xu as empress, and she was created as such late in 74 BC. He initially wanted to create his father-in-law Xu Guanghan a marquess, but Huo opposed, reasoning a eunuch who had suffered castration a
2 CONC s a punishment should not be made a marquess. Instead, Xu was given the title of Lord of Changcheng (昌成君).
2 CONT
2 CONT In 73 BC, Huo offered to be relieved of his responsibilities as regent. Emperor Xuan declined and ordered that all important matters of state still be submitted to Huo first. He also gave high positions to Huo's son Huo Yu (霍禹) an
2 CONC d grandnephews Huo Yun (霍雲) and Huo Shan (霍山), as well as Huo's sons-in-law Fan Mingyou (范明友) and Deng Guanghan (鄧廣漢). In many ways, Emperor Xuan, although now emperor, remained intimidated by the powers of Huo and was always humb
2 CONC le before him. In that same year, Emperor Xuan restored posthumous titles to his grandparents and parents (although, perhaps out of respect to Emperor Zhao's memory, Crown Prince Ju received the rather unflattering posthumous name
2 CONC  "Li" (戾, unrepenting)) and reburied them with honor. In 67 BC, he also finally found his maternal grandmother and her family, and he rewarded his grandmother and uncles with riches, and his uncles were created marquesses.
2 CONT
2 CONT Huo Guang's wife Xian (顯) would not be denied what she wanted—having her daughter as an empress. In 71 BC, Empress Xu was pregnant when Lady Xian came up with a plot. She bribed Empress Xu's female physician Chunyu Yan (淳于衍), unde
2 CONC r guise of giving Empress Xu medicine after she gave birth, to poison her. Chunyu did so, and Empress Xu died shortly after she gave birth. Her doctors were initially arrested to investigate whether they cared for the empress prop
2 CONC erly. Lady Xian, alarmed, informed Huo Guang what had actually happened, and Huo, not having the heart to turn in his wife, instead signed Chunyu's release.
2 CONT
2 CONT In that same year, a major battle with Xiongnu occurred. Xiongnu had been incessantly attacking the Xiyu (central Asia) kingdom of Wusun, whose queen was the Han princess Liu Jieyou (劉解憂). Emperor Xuan commissioned five generals a
2 CONC nd coordinated a plan with Wusun to attack Xiongnu at the same time. Xiongnu put the strongest defenses against the Han generals, and they largely fought inconclusively, but with the western frontiers weakened, Wusun forces won a 
2 CONC major victory over Xiongnu, severely crippling Xiongnu's western region. For years after, without Han engaging major forces, Xiongnu was constantly under attack by Dingling from the north, Wuhuan from the east, and Wusun from the 
2 CONC west, and became unable to harass Han borders. In 70 BC, Emperor Xuan created Huo Chengjun empress. Accustomed to luxury living, her palace expenditures far exceeded the late Empress Xu.
2 CONT
2 CONT Emperor Xuan's early reign was generally known for his willingness to innovate, to commission officials who were lenient on the people, and to listen to advice. For example, in 67 BC, based on a submission from a Justice Ministry 
2 CONC official Lu Wenshu (路溫舒), who was concerned about the harshness of the criminal justice system, Emperor Xuan added four appellate judges who were in charge of hearing final appeals. While this fell well short of what Lu suggested,
2 CONC  it did help to reform the justice system somewhat.
2 CONT
2 CONT The destruction of the Huo clan In 68 BC, Huo Guang died. Emperor Xuan and Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan made the nearly-unprecedented act of personally attending Huo's wake and built an impressive mausoleum for Huo. After Huo's
2 CONC  death, Zhang Anshi and Wei Xiang (魏相) became Emperor Xuan's most powerful advisors, but Emperor Xuan assumed far more personal powers than he had during Huo's lifetime. Later, Bing Ji (who had not yet revealed by this point the e
2 CONC xtent of his contribution to the emperor's survival in his young age) also became a key official. Huo's son, grandnephews, and sons-in-law remained in key posts, however.
2 CONT
2 CONT In 67 BC, Emperor Xuan created Prince Shi—the late Empress Xu's son—crown prince, and created Empress Xu's father Xu Guanghan the Marquess of Ping'en—an action that Huo Guang had opposed. Huo's wife Lady Xian was shocked and displ
2 CONC eased, because if her daughter were to have a son later, that son could only be a prince and not the future emperor. She instructed her daughter to murder the crown prince. Allegedly, Empress Huo did make multiple attempts to do s
2 CONC o, but failed each time. Around this time, the emperor also heard rumors that the Huos had murdered Empress Xu, which led him to begin stripping the Huos of actual power, while giving them impressive titles.
2 CONT
2 CONT In 66 BC, after there had been increasing public rumors that the Huos had murdered Empress Xu, Lady Xian finally revealed to her son and grandnephews that she had, indeed, murdered Empress Xu. In fear of what the emperor might do 
2 CONC if he had actual proof, Lady Xian, her son, her grandnephews, and her sons-in-law formed a conspiracy to depose the emperor. The conspiracy was discovered, and the entire Huo clan was executed by Emperor Xuan—an act that later dre
2 CONC w heavy criticism from historians for its ungratefulness to Huo Guang. (e.g., Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian.) (For the time being, Empress Huo was deposed but not executed, but 12 years later she was exiled; in response, she co
2 CONC mmitted suicide.)
2 CONT
2 CONT Middle reign During the middle stage of his reign, Emperor Xuan's administration continued to be known for the promotion of honest officials who generally cared for the people. It was also marked by further fostering of relationsh
2 CONC ips with Xiyu kingdoms, making them strong vassals. He was also characterized by attention to detail and willingness to have correspondences with his generals in which he kindly but firmly had concrete discussions with them on pro
2 CONC per military strategy in dealing with minority tribes and foreign nations. An example could be seen in his correspondences with General Zhao Chongguo (趙充國) in 62 BC to 60 BC when Zhao was on a mission to pacify the Qiang tribes, s
2 CONC ome of which were rebelling and some of which were considering rebellion. Zhao opposed the annihilation strategy that other generals had proposed and which Emperor Xuan had initially approved, but instead advocated better treatmen
2 CONC t of the tribes and establishment of military settlements to better prepare for any future rebellions. Eventually, Emperor Xuan agreed, and the Qiang tribes were pacified without major bloodshed. Also, after a short foray into mag
2 CONC ic in 61 BC, Emperor Xuan realized the follies of seeking immortality, and abandoned the would-be costly venture (unlike, for example, his great-grandfather Emperor Wu).
2 CONT
2 CONT In 64 BC, Emperor Xuan considered creating a new empress. At that time, his favorite consorts were Consorts Hua, Zhang, and Wei. He seriously considered creating Consort Zhang, the mother of his son Liu Qin (later Prince of Huaiya
2 CONC ng), empress, but was still hesitant over the episode in which Empress Huo nearly succeeded in poisoning Crown Prince Shi. He then resolved to create an empress who did not have sons of her own and was kind and gentle. He created 
2 CONC Consort Wang, not one of his favorites, empress and had her raise Crown Prince Shi as her own.
2 CONT
2 CONT That same year, he also changed his name to Xun (詢), to make it easier for the people to carry out "naming taboo" (the avoidance of using the emperor's name in speech or writing), because bing and yi were both common characters th
2 CONC at were hard to avoid.
2 CONT
2 CONT In 63 BC, having realized the extent of Bing's contributions to him, Emperor Xuan decided to repay him, and others who were involved in his upbringing, for their kindness. Bing and several others, in addition to Zhang He's adopted
2 CONC  son, were created marquesses. The prison guards who had treated him with kindness were also rewarded. His nurses Hu and Guo had already died by this point, but their descendants were tracked down and rewarded.
2 CONT
2 CONT Late reign Late in his reign, Emperor Xuan began to moderately become luxurious in living, but was still comparatively thrifty in his expenditures. He also began to relax from his early diligence in governing the state. He also be
2 CONC came less diligent in realizing of false reports by officials. For example, there were a large numbers of reported sightings of fenghuang (Chinese phoenixes) – mythological birds who were considered symbols of divine favor—during 
2 CONC this period, and while in ancient China there might have been "legitimate" sightings of phoenixes (that is, rare birds that were then-considered phoenixes), a good number of these reports were later shown to be likely hoaxes, but 
2 CONC Emperor Xuan accepted these reports without critically examining them: although in the case of reported sightings of a green rooster and golden horse in Shu (modern Sichuan), Xuan did dispatch one of his favoured poets and a Shu n
2 CONC ative, Wang Bao, to investigate and to bring back the golden horse, if found (though Wang became ill and died on the way). However, in general, Emperor Xuan's reign, even in this period, was marked by his concern for the people an
2 CONC d unwillingness to undertake military action unless necessary. For example, in 59 BC, a major Xiongnu civil war broke out—which would leave the Xiongnu fighting each other for years. Many generals advocated using this opportunity 
2 CONC to completely annihilate the Xiongnu. Emperor Xuan did not want to do so, but rather encouraged peace among the Xiongnu princes with hopes of having them submit to him.
2 CONT
2 CONT His efforts paid off. By 56 BC, Xiongnu had been fractured into three separate regimes, ruled by Chanyus Runzhen (閏振), Huhanye (呼韓邪), and Zhizhi. All three sought peace with Han, and Han was able to reduce its defense forces by on
2 CONC e fifth, decreasing the burdens on the people correspondingly. In 54 BC, Chanyu Runzhen was defeated and killed by Chanyu Zhizhi, who further sought to try to defeat Chanyu Huhanye to reunify Xiongnu. In response, in 53 BC, at the
2 CONC  advice of his official, Chanyu Huhanye headed south and requested to become a Han vassal to seek Han protection. In 51 BC, Chanyu Huhanye made an official visit to Chang'an as a Han vassal, and Emperor Xuan, correctly judging tha
2 CONC t he should seek to have Huhanye submit to him out of gratitude and not of fear, ordered that Huhanye not be required to bow to him, and that he be treated as higher than imperial princes. Emperor Xuan also commissioned an expedit
2 CONC ion force to assist Chanyu Huhanye in defending his territory. In 49 BC, Chanyu Huhanye made a second visit. With Han assistance, his strength grew, and Chanyu Zhizhi, who had previously been stronger, was in fact forced to move w
2 CONC est.
2 CONT
2 CONT In 53 BC, disappointed in Crown Prince Shi's overreliance on Confucian officials and lack of resolve, he considered creating Liu Qin, the Prince of Huaiyang, crown prince instead, but could not bring himself to do so—remembering h
2 CONC ow Prince Shi's mother Empress Xu was his first love and had been murdered by poisoning, and also how he depended on his father-in-law in his youth.
2 CONT
2 CONT In 51 BC, after Chanyu Huhanye's visit, Emperor Xuan, in his most shining moment, remembered key officials who had been instrumental in his success. In an unprecedented action, he had the portraits of 11 of them be painted onto th
2 CONC e main gallery of the main imperial palace, the Weiyang Palace. 
2 CONT
2 CONT The 11 were: Huo Guang Zhang Anshi Han Zeng (韓增) Zhao Chongguo Wei Xiang Bing Ji Du Yannian (杜延年) Liu De (劉德) Liang Qiuhe (梁丘賀) Xiao Wangzhi (蕭望之) Su Wu

2 CONC h his mother. Prince Li thereupon raised weapons, killed Jiang Chong and fought against the Capital guard but was defeated by Counsellor-in-chief (chengxiang 丞相) Liu Quli 劉屈氂. He was able to escape but soon after comitted suicide.
2 CONC  Emperor Wu later pardoned him posthumously and had set aflame the mansion the Jiang Chong. Prince Li's grandson was to become Emperor Xuan 漢宣帝 (r. 74-49 BCE). Prince Li "the Outstanding" is his posthumous honorific title.

2 CONT
2 CONT 156-87? B.C.
2 CONT
2 CONT Chinese Emperor
2 CONT
2 CONT During Wu-ti's reign, he expanded China's borders and influence through most of the world known to China. Because of this, he went down in history as one of the greatest emperors of China's Han Dynasty. After his death he was give
2 CONC n the name Wu-ti, which means "martial emperor," in honor of his victories.
2 CONT
2 CONT Wu-ti was born Liu Ch'e about 156 B.C., the son of Emperor Ching-ti. He was definitely not the eldest son of the emperor, in fact he is believed to have been son number 11, making him far from first in line to ascend to the throne
2 CONC . However, by his seventh birthday relatives assured his status as heir apparent, and he succeeded the throne in 140 or 141 about the age of 15.
2 CONT
2 CONT For the first several years of his reign, Wu-ti was heavily influenced by his relatives, who urged a more moderate, defensive approach to national security. By about 133, he launched the first of many attacks against threatening n
2 CONC eighbors, attempting to both secure and expand China's borders. In this first attack, he decided to secure China's northern border by attacking the Hsing-nu, a nomadic tribe that constitutedChina's primary threat from that directi
2 CONC on. Successful in this endeavor, Wu-ti set about an era of national expansion.
2 CONT
2 CONT Wu-ti next looked east, conquering northern and central Korea, which had slipped from Chinese control before his reign. He continued southward, bringing Vietnam and what is now southern China under his control by 128. Wu-ti contin
2 CONC ued this series of conquests, driving his armies with ruthless determination and little tolerance for error.
2 CONT
2 CONT At its greatest extent, Wu-ti's empire reached into Fergana, today's Uzbekistan, and controlled most of the world known to China. His exploits resembled those of Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.), except that Alexander personally
2 CONC  led his troops while Wu-ti remained in his capital. However, with a greater population at his command, Wu-ti controlled larger armies of up to 100,000 men plus the supply and support need to keep such a large army in the field. O
2 CONC f course paying for such a huge army was difficult, and Wu-ti reorganized the Chinese bureaucracy and raised taxes to more effectively administer his realm and pay for his government.
2 CONT
2 CONT In addition to his military and administrative exploits, Wu-ti dispatched missions of exploration and discovery, sent Chinese settlers into newly acquired territories, and helped foster trade with neighboring states. He also attem
2 CONC pted to make political and military alliances with western nations against the Huns, another group that threatened China at the time.
2 CONT
2 CONT Although his attempts to ally China with western nations were unsuccessful, Wu-ti was instrumental in establishing the Silk Road, a major source of transcontinental trade during subsequent centuries. Other initiatives were somewha
2 CONC t less successful. Obsessed with immortality, Wu-ti sent expeditions in search of a purported island of the immortals, but to no avail, of course. Another expedition was sent to bring "blood sweating" horses from central Asia, fee
2 CONC ling that their presence would signify heaven's grace for his empire. However, Wu-ti was almost entirely responsible for making Confucianism China's official religion, opening Confucian universities and other centers for Confucian
2 CONC  teachings.
2 CONT
2 CONT Wu-ti's expeditions and military campaigns cost more than even his new taxes could raise. During the final years of his reign, China's expenses far outstripped her income, and Wu-ti was forced to retrench, giving up some of his co
2 CONC nquered territories. In spite of this, China reached her greatest territorial extent during Wu-ti's reign, and he is considered to have been one of China's greatest leaders. Wu-ti died in 87 or 86 B.C. at about the age of 70.

2 CONT
2 CONT Emperor Han Wudi 漢武帝 (156-87, r. 141-87 BCE), personal name Liu Che 劉徹, was probably the most important ruler of the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). He was a son of Emperor Jing 漢景帝 (r. 157-141 BCE) and Lady Wang 王美人. As a child he 
2 CONC was enfeoffed as Prince of Jiaodong 膠東. He mounted the throne at the age of sixteen sui and ruled China for half a century. When Liu Che became emperor, the Han dynasty had already experienced times of hardship an challenged that 
2 CONC it had mastered. During that time, there were still several problems to be solved, political issues like the princedoms or the raids of the steppe federation of the Xiongnu 匈奴, as well as economical and financial questions. It was
2 CONC  therefore a time for general reforms in the administration and in foreign politics. In 127 Emperor Wu issued a decree (Tui'enling 推恩令 "Edict concerning the renouncing [of enfeoffment] and the benevolent [bestowing of titles]") th
2 CONC at thoroughly changed the enfeoffment practice: Titles of prince as well as marquis would in the future not any more endowed with a territory. This practice would ensure that no further territories were cut off from the imperial d
2 CONC omain. The princes were from now on strictly controlled by the central government so that it would not any more be possible that princes would join in rebellion, like the Seven Princes had done, or the Princes of Huainan 淮南, Liu A
2 CONC n 劉安, and Hengshan 衡山, Liu Ci 劉賜. Owners of a title of nobility were granted a fixed income but were not allowed to ruler over an own fief. In 122 Emperor Wu used a case of bribery as a excuse to strip off 106 persons of their ran
2 CONC ks of nobility. He also restructered the military institutions over which the central government had a direct control, like the Eight Commandants (ba xiaowei 八校尉) or the Palace Guard (yulinjun 羽林軍). The power of the emperor himsel
2 CONC f was strengthened by circumventing the office of the Counsellor-in-chief (chengxiang 丞相) through memorials from lower officials of the court like palace attendants (shizhong 侍中) or palace stewards (jishizhong 給事中 [sic!]). Emperor
2 CONC  Wu esteemed competence and excellent proposals rather than established offices. He divided the empire into 13 provinces (zhou 州) the officials of which were supervised by a regional inspector (cishi 刺史). So-called "severe officia
2 CONC ls" (kuli 酷吏) were regularly dispatched to all commanderies to see it that the local officials were doing a good job. The problem of the Xiongnu raids on Chinese border territory had never been solved during the past decades. The 
2 CONC Xiongnu had been appeased by tributary silk and by "peace through marriage" (heqin 和親), a method that required that a (true or faked) princess was sent to the Khan. The advisors of Emperor Wu thought the Han empire sufficiently st
2 CONC rong to end this humiliating politics and to challenge the Xiongnu militarily. In 127 general Wei Qing 衛青 attacked the Xiongnu in the region of Yunzhong 雲中, defeated the Princes of Loufan 樓煩王 and Baiyang 白羊王 and occupied a large t
2 CONC erritory north of the great Yellow River bend, where the commanderies of Shuofang 朔方 and Wuyuan 五原 were established. In 121 General Huo Qubing 霍去病 made another advance in the region of Longxi 隴西 (modern Gansu), defeated the Khan o
2 CONC f the Xiutu 休屠王 at the foots of the Qilian Range 祁連山 and seized the iron statues erected at Mt. Yanqi 焉耆山. He then marched farther into the steppe and forced the Prince of Hunya 渾邪王 to submit. The commanderies of Wuwei 武威, Jiuquan
2 CONC  酒泉， Zhangye 張掖 and Dunhuang 敦煌 were established. In 123 both generals attacked the Xiongnu hordes dwelling in the commanderies of Xiangjun 襄郡 and Daijun 代郡 and pursued them to Mt. Tianyan 寘顔山 and Lake Han 翰海. The result of these 
2 CONC campaigns was that the Xiongnu were repelled into the desert area of the Gobi and were prevented form easily staging raids on Chinese territory. The next step was to look for allies in the west with whose help the Xiongnu could be
2 CONC  utterly defeated. Emperor Wu dispatched Zhang Qian 張騫 to establish diplomatic relations with the Tokharians (in Chinese called Yuezhi 月氏). The alliance was not accomplished, but it opened the Han empire the way to the west. Anoth
2 CONC er area of Chinese expansion was the south of the empire that was at that time still mainly inhabited by native tribes of Austro-Asian origin, like the Min-Yue 閩越 and Dong-Ou 東甌 in Fujian, or the Nanyue 南越 in Guangdong, Guangxi an
2 CONC d the north of modern Vietnam. A series of commanderies was established there, and the region came under the direct administration of Han China. The diplomats Tang Meng 唐蒙 and Sima Xiangru 司馬相如 forced the Yi tribes 夷 in the southw
2 CONC est (modern Yunnan) and the Yelang 夜郎, Qiong 邛 and Zuo 筰 in Shu 蜀 (modern Sichuan) to accept the overlordship of the Han dynasty. Chinese forces occupied the kingdoms of Qielan 且蘭 and Dian 滇, integrating this area into the Chinese
2 CONC  orbit. The King of Korea, Wei Youqu 衛右渠 (Wi Ugŏ, last ruler of the so-called Wi Man Chosŏn dynasty 衛滿朝鮮), who had killed a high Han official of the commandery of Liaodong 遼東, was forced into submission by a punitive campaign. Als
2 CONC o here, the Han established four commanderies. The continuing campaigns, including the settling down of homeless people in the new commanderies, consumed large amounts of money, so that the state treasury soon fell into a precario
2 CONC us situation. Emperor Wu started selling official titles to increase the state income, began recruting troops from among the peasantry and using the poverty of many peasants that sold themselves as slaves to the government. The ta
2 CONC x burden was increased twofold. The peasants had to deliver a higher amount of grain to the local government, and the central government decided over an issue would decide the financial politics for the next two thousand years: Th
2 CONC e state monopolized the production and sales of salt and iron and could thereby decicisely increase its income. Coins were furthermore to be casted (sic!) exclusively by the government, and the value of the coins was fixed. Yet it
2 CONC  was not only the state who earned a lot from the monopoly, but also merchants granted a licence for this trade, like Kong Jin 孔僅 or Dongguo Xianyang 東郭咸陽. There was a heated debate at the court over the issue of the state monopol
2 CONC y. Emperor Wu was the first ruler after the First Emperor of Qin 秦始皇 (r. 246-210 BCE) who toured the empire and inspected the local situation especially in the southeast. In 109 he undertook an inspection tour to visit the hydraul
2 CONC ic works at the Yellow River dykes that would give a higher security against inundations. He also inspected the works at the Grand Canal 漕渠, the Longshou Canal 龍首渠, the Liufu Canal 六輔渠 and the Baiqu Canal 白渠. The first few emperor
2 CONC s of the Han dynasty had resorted to a politics of laissez-faire that is often linked with the Daoist principle of non-activity (wuwei 無爲). Under Emperor Wu, this situation was changed towards an activist policy in which the state
2 CONC  began not only intermingling in economy, but by which certain principles were created according to which a government had to operate. Emperor Wu adopted Confucianism as the state doctrine and followed the Confucian's rules for a 
2 CONC state ritual, like adopting a certain colour for the imperial robes, the offerings at the suburban altar (jiaosi 郊祀), the Fengshan 封禪 offerings to Heaven and Earth, for which he climbed Mt. Tai 泰山, ritualised hunting expeditions, 
2 CONC and the adoption of reign mottos (niaohao 年號), which became common for all emperors thereafter. He adopted the suggestion of Dong Zhongshu 董仲舒 and Gongsun Hong 公孫弘 to erect a National University (taixue 太學) with professors (boshi 
2 CONC 博士 "erudites") for the Confucian Classics, and to order all governors to comb their commanderies for worthies and persons of talent that could be brought into officialdom. Emperor Wu thus brought together the tradition of Confucia
2 CONC nism and its experts of state rituals with that of legalism and its professionals of administrative and penal law. All other state doctrines were abolished (bachu baijia 罷黜百家 "he expelled the hundred schools of thought"). The pers
2 CONC onal belief of Emperor Wu can be seen in the general trend of that time that was subject to the so-called Huang-Lao thought 黃老. One aspect of Huang-Lao thought was the belief in immortality, and Emperor Wu was a strong adherent of
2 CONC  this tradition. He had several magical practicioners (fangshi 方士) at his court and was impressed by magic and sorcery. In his older years, he was frightened by the thought that someone might cast a spell on him to make him sick a
2 CONC nd die. This mania led to a great witch-hunt in 91 BCE, during which his Heir Apparent, Prince Wei 衛太子, Liu Ju 劉據, rebelled and died. The capital Chang'an 長安 (modern Xi'an 西安, Shaanxi) was subject to investigation, and more than t
2 CONC en thousand persons were executed as being involved in sorcery. On his deathbed, he nominated a boy, the eight sui old Liu Fuling 劉弗陵, as his heir (Emperor Zhao 漢昭帝， 87-74 BCE), and ordered a collegium of four persons to assist th
2 CONC e future emperor. Huo Guang 霍光, Jin Midi 金日磾 [sic!], Shangguan Jie 上官桀 and Sang Hongyang 桑弘羊 would dominate the court politics for the next decades. Emperor Wu died in 87 BCE, leaving behind a strong and mature empire.

2 CONT When Wang Zhi was young, she was married to a local man named Jin Wangsun (金王孫), and had a daughter named Jin Su (金俗). However, her mother was told by a soothsayer that both of her daughters would become extremely honored. Zang Er
2 CONC  got the idea to offer her daughters to the crown prince, Liu Qi, and forcibly divorced Wang Zhi from her husband. Wang Zhi was then sent along with her sister to Crown Prince's palace to join his concubinage.

2 CONT As consort to the crown prince and then emperor
2 CONT
2 CONT After being offered to the Crown Prince, both Wang Zhi and her sister became favored. She then bore him three daughters, Princess Yangxin (陽信公主), Princess Nangong (南宮公主) and Princess Longlü (隆慮公主), and later a son named Liu Che (劉
2 CONC 徹) in 156 BC, on the day Liu Qi ascended to the throne as Emperor Jing of Han. When she was pregnant, she claimed that she dreamed a sun falling into her womb. Emperor Jing was ecstatic over the divine implication, and made Liu Ch
2 CONC e (his 10th son) the Prince of Jiaodong (膠東王) in 153 BC. Wang Zhi was also promoted to a consort for giving birth to a royal prince.
2 CONT
2 CONT Emperor Jing's formal wife, Empress Bo, was childless. As a result, Emperor Jing's oldest son Liu Rong (劉榮), born of his other favorite concubine Lady Li (栗姬), was created crown prince in 153 BC. Lady Li, feeling certain that her 
2 CONC son would become the emperor, grew arrogant and intolerant, and frequently threw tantrum at Emperor Jing out of jealousy over his favor towards other concubines. Her lack of tact would prove to be Consort Wang's chance.
2 CONT
2 CONT When Emperor Jing's older sister, Eldest Princess Guantao (館陶長公主) Liu Piao (劉嫖), offered to marry her daughter Chen Jiao (陳嬌) to Liu Rong, Lady Li rudely rejected the proposal out of grudge that Princess Guantao often pimped new c
2 CONC oncubines and siphoning away her favor from Emperor Jing. Consort Wang, who had been observing quietly and waiting for her chance, took the opportunity and secured a marriage alliance by offering to marry her 5-year-old son Liu Ch
2 CONC e. Now sided with Consort Wang, Princess Guantan then began incessantly bad-mouthing Lady Li in front of Emperor Jing. Gradually buying into his sister's words, Emperor Jing decided to test out Lady Li. One day he asked Lady Li th
2 CONC at whether she would happily foster-care the rest of his children if he was to pass away, only to have Lady Li rudely (and foolishly) refusing to comply. This made Emperor Jing angry and worried that if Liu Rong was to inherit the
2 CONC  throne and Lady Li to become empress dowager, many of his concubines might suffer the fate of Consort Qi.
2 CONT
2 CONT Seizing the opportunity, Consort Wang laid in the final straw for Lady Li. She hinted a minister to advise Emperor Jing to make Lady Li empress as Liu Rong was already the crown princes. Emperor Jing, already concluding that Lady 
2 CONC Li must not be made empress, was enraged and believed that Lady Li had conspired with government officials. He executed that minister who forwarded that proposal, and deposed Liu Rong to the Prince of Linjiang (臨江王) in 150 BC and 
2 CONC exiled him out of the capital city Chang'an. Lady Li was stripped off her titles and placed under house arrest, and died of frustration and depression not long after.
2 CONT
2 CONT Since Empress Bo's deposition one year earlier, the position of empress was open. Emperor Wu, who had always considered Liu Che to be his favorite son, soon made Consort Wang empress. Liu Che, now legally the oldest son of the Emp
2 CONC ress, was later made crown prince.
2 CONT
2 CONT As empress
2 CONT
2 CONT Remembering the lesson of Empress Bo's and Lady Li's fate, despite her honored position as empress, Empress Wang did not try to assert as much influence on her husband as her mother-in-law, Empress Dowager Dou, had asserted over h
2 CONC er father-in-law, Emperor Wen. She had good relations with her mother-in-law, and both she and her brother Wang Xin were key in calming Emperor Jing from his anger against his brother Liu Wu (劉武), the Prince of Liang and the favor
2 CONC ed young son of Empress Dowager Dou, when Liu Wu assassinated a number of court officials in 148 BC for opposing the proposal to have him appointed the heir apparent. It was because of this that Empress Dowager Dou wanted to creat
2 CONC e Wang Xin a marquess, a move initially blocked by his prime minister Zhou Yafu (周亞夫), although Emperor Jing eventually carried out the creation anyway. She was probably pleased when Zhou committed suicide in 143 BC after being fa
2 CONC lsely accused of treason and arrested. When Emperor Jing died in 141 BC, Crown Prince Che succeeded to the throne as Emperor Wu, and Empress Wang became empress dowager.
2 CONT
2 CONT As empress dowager
2 CONT
2 CONT After Empress Wang became empress dowager, her son carried out several immediate acts to honor her family members. Her mother was created the Lady of Pingyuan, and her half-brothers were created marquesses. Her daughter Jin Su, fr
2 CONC om her previous marriage, was tracked down and personally visited by Emperor Wu, and he created her the Lady of Xiucheng.
2 CONT
2 CONT Empress Dowager Wang exerted significant influence on her son, as can be seen from how, with her approval, her half-brother Tian Fen became the commander of the armed forces and exerted power even beyond the military affairs. Init
2 CONC ially, her influence was balanced and outweighed by that of her mother-in-law, Grand Empress Dowager Dou. After Grand Empress Dowager Dou's death in 135 BC, however, she would become the paramount figure at court, and it was in 13
2 CONC 5 BC that Tian Fen was made prime minister, although her son gradually asserted his position as he grew in age. For example, in 133 BC, in the aftermaths of the failed attempt to capture the Xiongnu chanyu at the Battle of Mayi, E
2 CONC mperor Wu wanted to execute the key strategist, Wang Hui (王恢, unrelated to her), who bribed Tian, who in turn persuaded her to speak on Wang Hui's behalf. Emperor Wu refused to accept her intercession, and forced Wang Hui to commi
2 CONC t suicide. However, it was at her behest that Emperor Wu executed his grand uncle Dou Ying (竇嬰) (Empress Dou's cousin) in 132 BC for having insulted Tian.

2 CONT Empress Dowager Wang died in 126 BC, and was buried with her second husband Emperor Jing.

2 CONT 霍光字子孟，票騎將軍去病弟也。父中孺，河東平陽人也，以縣吏給事平陽侯家，與侍者衛少兒私通而生去病。中孺吏畢歸家，娶婦生光，因絕不相聞。久之，少兒女弟子夫得幸於武帝，立為皇后，去病以皇后姊子貴幸。既壯大，乃自知父為霍中孺，未及求問。會為票騎將軍擊匈奴，道出河東，河東太守郊迎，負弩矢先驅，至平陽傳捨，遣吏迎霍中孺。中孺趨入拜謁，將軍迎拜，因跪曰：「去病不早自知為大人遺體也。」中孺扶報叩頭，曰：「老臣得託命將軍，此天力也。」去病大為中孺買田宅、奴婢而去。還，復過
2 CONC 焉，乃將光西至長安，時年十餘歲，任光為郎，稍遷諸曹、侍中。去病死後，光為奉車都尉、光祿大夫，出則奉車，入侍左右，出入禁闥二十餘年，小心謹慎，未嘗有過，甚見親信。
2 CONT
2 CONT 征和二年，衛太子為江充所敗，而燕王旦、廣陵王胥皆多過失。是時，上年老，寵姬鉤弋趙婕妤有男，上心欲以為嗣，命大臣輔之。察群臣唯光任大重，可屬社稷。上乃使黃門畫者畫周公負成王朝諸侯以賜光。後元二年春，上游五柞宮，病篤，光涕泣問曰：「如有不諱，誰當嗣者？」上曰：「君未諭前畫意邪？立少子，君行周公之事。」光頓首讓曰：「臣不如金日磾。。」日磾亦曰：「臣外國人，不如光。」上以光為大司馬大將軍，日磾為車騎將軍，及太僕上官桀為左將軍，搜粟都尉桑弘羊為御史大夫，皆拜臥內床下
2 CONC ，受遺詔輔少主。明日，武帝崩，太子襲尊號，是為孝昭皇帝。帝年八歲，政事一決於光。
2 CONT
2 CONT 先是，後元元年，侍中僕射莽何羅與弟重合侯通謀為逆，時，光與金日磾、上官桀等共誅之，功未錄。武帝病，封璽書曰：「帝崩發書以從事。」遺詔封金日磾為秺侯，上官桀為安陽侯，光為博陸侯，皆以前捕反者功封。時，衛尉王莽子男忽侍中，揚語曰：「帝崩，忽常在左右，安得遺詔封三子事！群兒自相貴耳。」光聞之，切讓王莽，莽鴆殺忽。

2 CONT 光為人沉靜詳審，長財七尺三寸，白皙，疏眉目，美鬚髯。每出入下殿門，止進有常處，郎僕射竊識視之，不失尺寸，其資性端正如此。初輔幼主，政自己出，天下想聞其風采。殿中嘗有怪，一夜群臣相驚，光召尚符璽郎，郎不肯授光。光欲奪之，郎按劍曰：「臣頭可得，璽不可得也！」光甚誼之。明日，詔增此郎秩二等。眾庶莫不多光。
2 CONT
2 CONT 光與左將軍桀結婚相親，光長女為桀子安妻。有女年與帝相配，桀因帝姊鄂邑蓋主內安女後宮為婕妤，數月立為皇后。父安為票騎將軍，封桑樂侯。光時休沐出，桀輒入代光決事。桀父子既尊盛，而德長公主。公主內行不修，近幸河間丁外人。桀、安欲為外人求封，幸依國家故事以列侯尚公主者，光不許。又為外人求光祿大夫，欲令得召見，又不許。長主大以是怨光。而桀、安數為外人求官爵弗能得，亦慚。自先帝時，桀已為九卿，位在光右。及父子並為將軍，有椒房中宮之重，皇后親安女，光乃其外祖，而顧專制朝

2 CONT
2 CONT 燕王旦自以昭帝兄，常懷怨望。及御史大夫桑弘羊建造酒榷、鹽鐵，為國興利，伐其功，欲為子弟得官，亦怨恨光。於是蓋主、上官桀、安及弘羊皆與燕王旦通謀，詐令人為燕王上書，言：「光出都肄郎羽林，道上稱蹕，太官先置。」又引：「蘇武前使匈奴，拘留二十年不降，還乃為典屬國，而大將軍長史敞亡功為搜粟都尉，又擅調益莫府校尉。光專權自恣，疑有非常。臣旦願歸符璽，入宿衛，察奸臣變。」候司光出沐日奏之。桀欲從中下其事，桑弘羊當與諸大臣共執退光。書奏，帝不肯下。
2 CONT
2 CONT 明旦，光聞之，止畫室中不入。上問：「大將軍安在？」左將軍桀時曰：「以燕王告其罪，故不敢入。」有詔召大將軍。光入，免冠頓首謝，上曰：「將軍冠。朕知是書詐也，將軍亡罪。」光曰：「陛下何以知之？」上曰：「將軍之廣明都郎，屬耳；調校尉以來未能十日，燕王何以得知之？且將軍為非，不須校尉。」是時，帝年十四，尚書左右皆驚，而上書者果亡，捕之甚急，桀等懼，白上小事不足遂，上不聽。
2 CONT
2 CONT 後桀黨有譖光者，上輒怒曰：「大將軍忠臣，先帝所屬以輔朕身，敢有毀者坐之。」自是桀等不敢復言，乃謀令長公主置酒請光，伏兵格殺之，因廢帝，迎立燕王為天子。事發覺，光盡誅桀、安、弘羊、外人宗族。燕王、蓋主皆自殺。光威震海內。昭帝既冠，遂委任光，訖十三年，百姓充實，四夷賓服。
2 CONT
2 CONT 元平元年，昭帝崩，亡嗣。武帝六男獨有廣陵王胥在，群臣議所立，咸特廣陵王。王本以行失道，先帝所不用。光內不自安。郎有上書言：「周太王廢太伯立王季，文王捨伯邑考立武王，唯在所宜，雖廢長立少可也。廣陵王不可以承宗廟。」言合光意。光以其書視丞相敞等，擢郎為九江太守，即日承皇太后詔，遣行大鴻臚事少府樂成、宗正德、光祿大夫吉、中郎將利漢迎昌邑王賀。
2 CONT
2 CONT 賀者，武帝孫，昌邑哀王子也。既至，即位，行淫亂。光憂懣，獨以問所親故吏大司農田延年。延年曰：「將軍為國柱石，審此人不可，何不建白太后，更選賢而立之？」光曰：「今欲如是，於古嘗有此不？」延年曰：「伊尹相殷，廢太甲以安宗廟，後世稱其忠。將軍若能行此，亦漢之伊尹也。」光乃引延年給事中，陰與車騎將軍張安世圖計，遂召丞相、御史、將軍、列侯、中二千石、大夫、博士會議未央宮。光曰：「昌邑王行昏亂，恐危社稷，如何？」群臣皆驚鄂失色，莫敢發言，但唯唯而已。田延年前，離席按劍
2 CONC ，曰：「先帝屬將軍以幼孤，寄將軍以天下，以將軍忠賢能安劉氏也。今群下鼎沸，社稷將傾，且漢之傳謚常為孝者，以長有天下，令宗廟血食也。如令漢家絕祀，將軍雖死，何面目見先帝於地下乎？今日之議，不得旋踵。群臣後應者，臣請劍斬之。」光謝曰：「九卿責光是也。天下匈匈不安，光當受難。」於是議者皆叩頭，曰：「萬姓之命在於將軍，唯大將軍令。」
2 CONT
2 CONT 光即與群臣俱見白太后，具陳昌邑王不可以承宗廟狀。皇太后乃車駕幸未央承明殿，詔諸禁門毋內昌邑群臣。王入朝太后還，乘輦欲歸溫室，中黃門宦者各持門扇，王入，門閉，昌邑群臣不得入。王曰：「何為？」大將軍跪曰：「有皇太后詔，毋內昌邑群臣。」王曰：「徐之，何乃驚人如是！」光使盡驅出昌邑群臣，置金馬門外。車騎將軍安世將羽林騎收縛二百餘人，皆送廷尉詔獄。令故昭帝侍中中臣侍守王。光敕左右：「謹宿衛，卒有物故自裁，令我負天下，有殺主名。」王尚未自知當廢，謂左右：「我故群臣從官

2 CONT 顯及禹、山、雲自見日侵削，數相對啼泣，自怨。山曰：「今丞相用事。縣官信之，盡變易大將軍時法令，以公田賦與貧民，發揚大將軍過失。又諸儒生多窶人子，遠客饑寒，喜妄說狂言，不避忌諱，大將軍常仇之，今陛下好與諸儒生語，人人自使書對事，多言我家者。嘗有上書言大將軍時主弱臣強，專制擅權，今其子孫用事，昆弟益驕恣，恐危宗廟，災異數見，盡為是也。其言絕痛，山屏不奏其書。後上書者益黠，盡奏封事，輒下中書令出取之，不關尚書，益不信人。」顯曰：「丞相數言我家，獨無罪乎？」山曰：
2 CONC 「丞相廉正，安得罪？我家昆弟諸婿多不謹。又聞民間言雚言霍氏毒殺許皇后，寧有是邪？」顯恐急，即具以實告山、雲、禹。山、雲、禹驚曰：「如是，何不早告禹等！縣官離散斥逐諸婿，用是故也。此大事，誅罰不小，奈何？」於是始有邪謀矣。

2 CONT 初，趙平客石夏善為天官，語平曰：「熒惑守禦星，御星，太僕奉車都尉也，不黜則死。」平內憂山等。雲舅李竟所善張赦見雲家卒卒，謂竟曰：「今丞相與平恩侯用事，可令太夫人言太后，先誅此兩人。移徙陛下，在太后耳。」長安男子張章告之，事下廷尉。執金吾捕張赦、石夏等，後有詔止勿捕。山等愈恐，相謂曰：「此縣官重太后，故不竟也。然惡端已見，又有弒許後事，陛下雖寬仁，恐左右不聽，久之猶發，發即族矣，不如先也。」遂令諸女各歸報其夫，皆曰：「安所相避？」
2 CONT
2 CONT 會李竟坐與諸侯王交通，辭語及霍氏，有詔雲、山不宜宿衛，免，就第。光諸女遇太后無禮，馮子都數犯法，上並以為讓，山、禹等甚恐，顯夢第中井水溢流庭下，灶居樹上，又夢大將軍謂顯曰：「知捕兒不？亟下捕之。」第中鼠暴多，與人相觸，以尾畫地。鴞數鳴殿前樹上。第門自壞。雲尚冠裡宅中門亦壞。巷端人共見有人居雲屋上，徹瓦投地，就視，亡有，大怪之。禹夢車騎聲正言雚來捕禹，舉家憂愁。山曰：「丞相擅減宗廟羔、菟、蛙，可以此罪也。」謀令太后為博平君置酒，召丞相、平恩侯以下，使范明友、
2 CONC 鄧廣漢承太后制引斬之，因廢天子而立禹。約定未發，雲拜為玄菟太守，太中大夫任宣為代郡太守。山又坐寫秘書，顯為上書獻城西第，八馬千匹，以贖山罪。書報聞，會事發覺，雲、山、明友自殺，顯、禹、廣漢等捕得。禹要斬，顯及諸女昆弟皆棄市。唯獨霍後廢處昭台宮，與霍氏相連坐誅滅者數千家。

2 CONT 上乃下詔曰：「乃者東織室令史張赦使魏郡豪李竟報冠陽侯雲謀為大逆，朕以大將軍故，抑而不揚，冀其自新。今大司馬博陸侯禹與母宣成侯夫人顯及從昆弟子冠陽侯雲、樂平侯山諸姊妹婿謀為大逆，欲詿誤百姓。賴宗廟神靈，先發得，咸伏其辜，朕甚悼之。諸為霍氏所詿誤，事在丙申前，未發覺在吏者，皆赦除之。男子張章先發覺，以語期門董忠，忠告在曹楊惲，惲告侍中金安上。惲召見對狀，後章上書以聞。侍中史高與金安上建發其事，言無入霍氏禁闥，卒不得遂其謀，皆讎有功。封章為博成侯，忠高昌侯，惲平

2 CONT 初，霍氏奢侈，茂陵徐生曰：「霍氏必亡。夫奢則不遜，不遜必侮上。侮上者，逆道也。在人之右，眾必害之。霍氏秉權日久，害之者多矣。天下害之，而又行以逆道，不亡何待！」乃上疏言：「霍氏泰盛，陛下即愛厚之，宜以時抑制，無使至亡。」書三上，輒報聞。其後霍氏誅滅，而告霍氏者皆封。人為徐生上書曰：「臣聞客有過主人者，見其灶直突，傍有積薪，客謂主人，更為曲突，遠徙其薪，不者且有火患。主人嘿然不應。俄而家果失火，鄰里共救之，幸而得息。於是殺牛置酒，謝其鄰人，灼爛者在於上行，余
2 CONC 各以功次坐，而不錄言曲突者。人謂主人曰：『鄉使聽客之言，不費牛、酒，終亡火患。今論功而請賓，曲突徙薪亡恩澤，焦頭爛額為上客耶？』主人乃寤而請之，今茂陵徐福數上書言霍氏且有變，宜防絕之。鄉使福說得行，則國亡裂土出爵之費，臣亡逆亂誅滅之敗。往事既已，而福獨不蒙其功，唯陛下察之，貴徙薪曲突之策，使居焦發灼爛之右。」上乃賜福帛十匹，後以為郎。

2 CONT 宣帝始立，謁見高廟，大將軍光從驂乘，上內嚴憚之，若有芒刺在背。後車騎將軍張安世代光驂乘，天子從容肆體，甚安近焉。及光身死而宗族竟誅，故俗傳之曰：「威震主者不畜，霍氏之禍萌於驂乘。」

2 CONT 至成帝時，為光置守塚百家，吏卒奉詞焉。元始二年，封光從父昆弟曾孫陽為博陸侯，千戶。

1 OCCU Empress
1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Empress Dowager Bo (薄太后) was an imperial concubine of Emperor Gao of Han (Liu Bang). She was also known as Consort Bo(薄姬) during the life of the Emperor, and more formally as either Empress Dowager Xiaowen (孝文太后) o
2 CONC r (rarer) Empress Gao (高皇后). Despite being a concubine of lower standing, her son, Liu Heng, became Emperor Wen of Han, cementing her place in history. The year of her birth is not known. She died in 155 BC.
2 CONT
2 CONT Early years[edit]The future Empress Dowager Bo's father, Gentleman Bo (薄翁), came from Wu County (吳縣, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu). He had an adulterous affair with a Lady Wei (魏媼), the daughter of a member of the Wei royal family. E
2 CONC mpress Dowager Bo was born of this union.
2 CONT
2 CONT According to Chinese historical works (with the exception the Book of Han, which tells a different version of her life), Lady Bo was, when she was young, the prettiest concubine of Wei Bao, the Prince of Wei. Wei Bao allied himsel
2 CONC f with Liu Bang to defeat Xiang Yu's force, but later betrayed Liu Bang by defecting to Xiang Yu's camp. Unlike other defectors who switched sides again after Liu Bang's final victory, Wei Bao remained loyal to Xiang Yu to the end
2 CONC . After Han Xin conquered Wei, Wei Bao and his entire family were brought in front of Liu Bang to await execution. Wei Bao begged for mercy, but the emperor was unreceptive until he offered Lady Bo as a gift to Liu Bang. Her beaut
2 CONC y had captured the attention of the emperor, and she was taken as an imperial concubine. Her former husband was thus spared execution. Historical records did not provide the information on whether other members of Wei Bao's family
2 CONC  were spared as well, but it was likely the case.
2 CONT
2 CONT Lady Bo was not favored among the concubines, but she gave birth to a son, Liu Heng, who was made the Prince of Dai. The birth of her son elevated Lady Bo's status to Consort Bo. Unlike many other concubines, she was not confined 
2 CONC to the palace and was allowed to accompany her son to the remote Principality of Dai (modern northern Shanxi and northwestern Hebei) to be the princess dowager. Dai was not a rich domain, and the region was under constant threats 
2 CONC and attacks from the Xiongnu. Although Consort Bo could not live a luxurious lifestyle so far from the imperial palaces, she still managed to have a relatively comfortable life. Nonetheless, she had to work as a seamstress. Such r
2 CONC ather difficult living conditions in comparison to other consorts had an unexpected benefit: unlike other consorts who became Empress Lü Zhi's victims due to her jealousy, Empress Lü Zhi was very sympathetic to Consort Bo. The emp
2 CONC ress never saw Bo and her son as a threat to her quest of power, and thus, the two were spared from the politics that killed many other concubines and princes.
2 CONT
2 CONT The Book of Han tells a different story of how Lady Bo came to become the emperor's concubine. It states that Liu Bang discovered Lady Bo working as a seamstress in Dai and took her as his concubine there. Despite this difference 
2 CONC in Lady Bo's origin, the Book of Han and other historical texts converge with Lady Bo and her son, Liu Heng, in the Principality of Dai.
2 CONT
2 CONT Rise to the top[edit]In 180 BC, after the death of her mistress, Emperor Gao's wife Grand Empress Dowager Lü, and after the officials then slaughtered the Lü clan, they offered the throne to Prince Heng over his nephew Emperor Hou
2 CONC shao -- whom they accused of not being imperial blood. Prince Heng consulted Princess Dowager Bo, who could not decide either. It was later, after they dispatched Princess Dowager Bo's brother Bo Zhao (薄昭) to the capital Chang'an 
2 CONC to observe the situation and to ascertain the officials' good faith that Prince Heng chose to accept the throne.
2 CONT
2 CONT Later years[edit]
2 CONT  The tomb of Empress Dowager Bo in Xi'an, ShaanxiAfter Prince Heng took the throne as Emperor Wen, Princess Dowager Bo was honored as empress dowager, even though she had not previously been an empress. She was largely unassuming 
2 CONC as empress dowager, and did not exert anywhere close to the influence that Empress Dowager Lü asserted over Emperor Hui or even her daughter-in-law, Empress Dou, would later assert over her grandson Emperor Jing. The one major ins
2 CONC tance in which she asserted her influence was in 176 BC. At that time, Zhou Bo (周勃), who had been instrumental in Emperor Wen's becoming emperor, had retired to his march when he was falsely accused of treason and arrested. Empres
2 CONC s Dowager Bo, believing in Zhou's innocence, famously threw her scarf at Emperor Wen, stating:
2 CONT
2 CONT Before you became emperor, Zhou was in control of the imperial seal, and commanded the powerful northern guards. How ridiculous is it that he did not commit treason then, but now plans to use his small march as the base for a rebe
2 CONC llion? It was at least partly due to her influence that Emperor Wen eventually released Zhou.
2 CONT
2 CONT She either did not try to intercede similarly (as appears most likely) or was ineffective in her intercession, when her brother Bo Zhao killed an imperial messenger—a crime far more serious than ordinary murder—in 170 BC. Even tho
2 CONC ugh Bo Zhao was the Empress Dowager's only sibling, Emperor Wen eventually pressed him into committing suicide.
2 CONT
2 CONT One of the final influences Empress Dowager Bo had was when she arranged for the daughter of one of her relatives to marry her grandson, then-Crown Prince Qi, during her son's reign. After Emperor Wen died in 157 BC and Crown Prin
2 CONC ce Qi succeeded him as Emperor Jing, Empress Dowager Bo became grand empress dowager. There was no recorded instance of her trying to assert political influence after that. She died just two years later in 155 BC.[1] (This would p
2 CONC rove disastrous for Empress Bo, Emperor Jing's wife, as she, now without support, was soon deposed.)
2 CONT
2 CONT After she died, she was enshrined in a temple of her own rather than in her husband's temple, because only one empress could be enshrined in an emperor's temple, and Empress Lü was already enshrined in Emperor Gao's temple. Later,
2 CONC  during Emperor Guangwu's reign, however, he effectively reversed the position of Empress Dowager Bo and Empress Lü by enshrining Empress Dowager Bo as "Empress Gao" and demoting Empress Dowager Lü to a separate temple.

2 CONT Liu Pang Emperor of the Han Dynasty of China 中國的漢朝代的皇帝, aka Gao (Gaozu), Liu Bang; as police officer under arrest, led rebellion against Qing Dynasty; founded Han Dynasty 206 BC, died circa 195 BC.
2 CONT
2 CONT This is a Chinese name; the family name is Liu (劉). 
2 CONT
2 CONT Emperor Gao (256 BC or 247 BC–June 1, 195 BC), commonly known inside China by his Temple Name, Gaozu (Chinese: 高祖; pinyin: Gāozǔ, Wade-Giles: Kao Tsu), personal name Liu Bang (Wade-Giles: Liu Pang), was the first emperor of the Ch
2 CONC inese Han Dynasty, ruling over China from 202 BC until 195 BC, and one of only a few dynasty founders who emerged from the peasant class (the other major example being Zhu Yuanzhang founder of the Míng Dynasty). Before becoming an
2 CONC  emperor, he was also called Duke of Pei (沛公) after his birthplace. He was also created the Prince of Hàn by Xiàng Yŭ, the Grand Prince of Western Chu, following the collapse of the Qín Dynasty, and was known by this title before 
2 CONC becoming emperor.
2 CONT
2 CONT Early life
2 CONT
2 CONT Liú Bāng was born into a lower class farming family in Pei (present Pei County in Jiangsu Province). At the time, Pei was part of the State of Chu. He relied on his brother's family for food. Though there was more than enough food
2 CONC  to feed everyone, his sister-in-law went to the kitchen to scrape the pots, thus causing all his friends to leave, as they thought that the family was too poor to feed them. His sister-in-law's contempt for his roguish ways was w
2 CONC hat made Liú Bāng think about actually studying and serving his country for a while.
2 CONT
2 CONT After he grew up, Liú Bāng served as a patrol officer in his county. Once he was responsible for transporting a group of prisoners to Mount Li in present Shaanxi province. During the trip many prisoners fled. Fearful that he would
2 CONC  be punished for the prisoners' flight, Liú Bāng offered the remaining prisoners their freedom if they would fight for him. In legend, the released prisoners fled, met with a cobra snake and went back the way they came, running in
2 CONC to Liú Bāng. Hearing their story, he went and killed the cobra himself. The cobra was supposedly larger than a full grown tree, and its breath was poisonous, killing many prisoners. Liu Bang was brave enough to kill the snake at d
2 CONC awn. From then on, the prisoners respected him and made him their leader, hence Liú Bāng became the leader of a band of brigands. On one of his raids, he met a county magistrate who became impressed with his leadership skills and 
2 CONC gave his daughter Lü Zhi to him in marriage.
2 CONT
2 CONT Chu-Han Contention
2 CONT
2 CONT Now considering the whole former Qín Empire under his domination, Xiang Yu realigned the territories of not only the remaining parts of Qín but also the rebel states, dividing the territories into 19 principalities. Xiang Yu did n
2 CONC ot honor the promise by Xin, Prince Huai of Chu, who would soon himself be assassinated by Xiang's orders. Instead, he gave Guanzhong to the princes of three Qins. Liú Bāng was only awarded the Principality of Hàn (modern Sichuan,
2 CONC  Chongqing, and southern Shaanxi).
2 CONT
2 CONT In Hanzhong, Liú Bāng focused his efforts on developing agriculture methods and training an army, through which he reinforced his resource accumulation and military power. Before long, Liú broke out of his principality, deposed th
2 CONC e kings of three Qins and occupied Guanzhong, where he launched a war now known as the Chu-Han War, against Xiang Yu. He is quoted in his biography, Establishment of the Great, that "Those who earn their status by war are the most
2 CONC  honorable of all."
2 CONT
2 CONT Although Xiang Yu won most of his battles against Liú Bāng, his ruthlessness put him at a political disadvantage. Xiang Yu kept defeating Liú in the battlefield, but each of his victories drove more people to support Liú. When Xia
2 CONC ng Yu was finally defeated in the Battle of Gaixia, he could not recover and committed suicide.
2 CONT
2 CONT The war lasted five years (206–202 BC) and ended with Liú Bāng's victory. Having defeated Xiang Yu, Liú proclaimed himself emperor and established the Hàn Dynasty in 202 BC, making Cháng'ān (present-day city of Xi'an) his capital.
2 CONC  Liú became known historically as Emperor Gāo of Hàn.
2 CONT
2 CONT Reign
2 CONT
2 CONT After Liu Bāng came into power, he re-modeled China based on Qín's example. He gradually replaced the original vassals, granting their lands to his relatives. Since the economy had been devastated by the war following the demise o
2 CONC f the Qín Dynasty, he reduced taxes and corvée, developed agriculture and restricted spending. However, in response to what he saw as the decadence of Qín merchants, he restricted commerce by levying heavy taxes and legal restrict
2 CONC ions on merchants. He also made peace with the Xiongnu. Under Gāozǔ's reign, Confucian thought gradually replaced Legalist thought; Confucian scholars were welcomed into his government, while the harsh Legalist laws were lessened.
2 CONC  Emperor Gāozǔ's efforts laid a solid foundation for the over four-hundred-year reign of the Hàn Dynasty.
2 CONT
2 CONT Liú Bāng also devoted to subduing the unruly kings. He soon annexed most of the kingdoms and established principalities, with his sons and relatives as princes. By doing so he consolidated his new-born empire.

2 CONT Biography
2 CONT
2 CONT Liu Bang was born in 247 BC, the son of Liu Taigong, and he was originally a soldier of the State of Chu before joining Xiang Yu's rebellion against the Qin dynasty in 207 BC. In 206, Xiang Yu divided the Qin into the Eighteen Kin
2 CONC gdoms, with Liu Bang leading the state of Han in Hanzhong. Liu Bang expanded his kingdom, and soon, he was at odds with Xiang Yu's Western Chu in the Chu-Han Contention. By 202 BC, Liu Bang had emerged victorious and Xiang Yu had 
2 CONC been killed by a defecting soldier. Taking on the regnal name of "Gaozu", Liu Bang courted popularity and consolidated their rule by denouncing the harshness of the Qin and renouncing Qin laws. Stories stress his fondness for drin
2 CONC k, blunt speech, and easy manner, and he was a man of the people. His descendant Liu Bei sought to be like him, being benevolent and later becoming King of Hanzhong.

2 CONC ncle, Gong [3597], identifies the "real" Pengcheng Liu(2) as beginning with the enfeoffment of Han Xuandi's son. However, the Pengcheng Liu(2) rulers of Liu(2) Song trace their ancestry to Liu(2) Bang's [16622] younger brother, Ji

1 CONC ely rise up in military self-defence in 91 BC. Being misunderstood as a revolt, Prince Ju was defeated and went into exile, and both he and Empress Wei committed suicide soon afterwards.
1 CONT
1 CONT After Prince Ju's death, Emperor Wu was forced to consider who would make a good heir. Liu Dan, the Prince of Yan, was Emperor Wu's oldest surviving son, but Emperor Wu considered both him and his younger brother Liu Xu, the Princ
1 CONC e of Guangling, to be unsuitable, since neither respected laws. Left with no other options, he decided on his youngest son, Prince Fuling, who was only six at that time. He therefore also chose a potential regent in Huo Guang, who
1 CONC m he considered to be capable and faithful. He also orderd Prince Fuling's mother, Consort Zhao, arrested and executed, in fear that she would become an uncontrollable empress dowager, like Empress Dowager Lü. He entrusted Huo wit
1 CONC h the regency of Fuling. At Huo's suggestion, he also made ethnic Xiongnu official Jin Ridi and general Shangguang Jie coregents. He died in 87 BC, shortly after creating Prince Fuling crown prince. Crown Prince Fuling then succee
1 CONC ded to the throne as Emperor Zhao at the age of 8.

1 CONT [edit] Early reign and marriage
1 CONT
1 CONT Early in Emperor Zhao's reign, Huo, Jin, and Shangguan served as coregents, with the key decisions being made by Huo. The palace was run by Princess Eyi, Emperor Wu's daughter and Emperor Zhao's older sister, who had moved back to
1 CONC  the palace to serve as Emperor Zhao's caretaker.
1 CONT
1 CONT Prince Dan of Yan was not happy about the turn in events that led to Emperor Zhao's ascension. In 86 BC, he secretly planned a rebellion, forming a conspiracy with two imperial clan members, Liu Zhang (??) and Liu Ze (??). The pla
1 CONC n was for them to accuse Emperor Zhao of being not actually Emperor Wu's son, and then for Liu Ze, a grandson of a former prince of Qi, to start a rebellion in Linzi (??, in modern Zibo, Shandong), the former capital of the Princi
1 CONC pality of Qi, while Prince Dan would then start a rebellion from his Principality of Yan (roughly modern Beijing). The conspiracy was discovered, but Prince Dan was not punished, although the other conspirators were executed.
1 CONT
1 CONT Later that year, Jin, a moderating influence in the coregency, after being created a marquess on his sickbed, died. Huo and Shangguan were subsequently created marquesses as well. In the next few years, Shangguan, unhappy with his
1 CONC  lesser role in the coregency, would try to gain more power over Huo, even though the two had previously been great friends, and Huo had given his daughter in marriage to Shangguan's son Shangguan An (???). The young couple had a 
1 CONC daughter, who was age five in 84 BC, when Shangguan Jie wanted to marry her to the emperor. Huo initially refused, believing her to be too young.
1 CONT
1 CONT Shangguan Jie turned elsewhere for support of his plan. Shangguan An was a friend of Princess Eyi's lover, Ding Wairen (???). He encouraged Ding to persuade the princess on the soundness of the marriage -- reasoning that the Shang
1 CONC guans' power would be firmer with the marriage, and that they could then help Ding legitimize his relationship with Princess Eyi. Princess Eyi agreed, and later in 84 BC, the young Lady Shangguan was created an imperial consort. I
1 CONC n 83 BC, she was created empress.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Middle reign and the struggle between Shangguan and Huo
1 CONT
1 CONT In 82 BC, a man whose appearance was similar to the former Crown Prince Ju suddenly appeared at the palace, claiming that he was in fact Prince Ju and that he was there to claim the throne. He was arrested and shown to be an impos
1 CONC ter named Cheng Fangsui (???), and then executed.
1 CONT
1 CONT Later that year, Shangguan An was created a marquess, and he became extremely arrogant and wild in his behavior.
1 CONT
1 CONT In the same year, at the suggestion of Du Yannian (???), Huo started considering terminating some of the policies of Emperor Wu intended to raise revenues for the war efforts. In 81 BC, after a major debate between proponents (the
1 CONC  chief among whom was vice prime minister Sang Hongyang (???)) and opponents of the state monopolies on salt, iron, and wine, the wine and iron monopolies were abolished, greatly reducing the burden of the people in purchasing tho
1 CONC se materials. The people started to recover from the heavy burdens that Emperor Wu's wars had left on them.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 80 BC, the latent conflict between Huo and Shangguan Jie would come into fore. The Shangguans, in thanks to Ding for his role in setting up the marriage between Empress Shangguan and Emperor Zhao, wanted to have him created a m
1 CONC arquess, but were rebuffed by Huo, as were their subsequent efforts to have Ding made an important official. This caused Princess Eyi to resent Huo as well. The Shangguans, Princess Eyi, Prince Dan of Yan, and Sang (who was resent
1 CONC ful that his monopoly system, which he felt to be the key to sound finances for the state, was being dismantled), formed an anti-Huo conspiracy. In 80 BC, Prince Dan sent a report to Emperor Zhao, accusing Huo of improperly exerci
1 CONC sing imperial authority. The conspirators' plan was that as soon as Emperor Zhao authorized an investigation, Shangguan Jie and Sang would arrest and immediately execute Huo. However, after the report was given to Emperor Zhao, th
1 CONC e 14-year-old Emperor Zhao took no action on it; the next day, he summoned Huo to the palace and exonerated him, reasoning that the actions that were accused of Huo had happened so recently that Prince Dan, a long distance away, c
1 CONC ould not have possibly known them, and therefore the report must have been a forgery. At this point, the anti-Huo conspiracy was not discovered, but the entire empire was impressed at the wisdom of the young emperor.
1 CONT
1 CONT Later that year, the conspirators would try again. Their plan was for Princess Eyi to invite Huo to a feast, and then to, at the feast, ambush Huo and kill him, and then depose Emperor Zhao and make Prince Dan emperor. (However, a
1 CONC llegedly, the Shangguans conspired to instead, once Prince Dan stepped into the capital, to have him killed, and for Shangguan Jie to declare himself emperor.) The conspiracy was revealed by a servant of Princess Eyi, and the cons
1 CONC pirators were arrested and executed with their entire clans. Princess Eyi and Prince Dan committed suicide. Empress Shangguan was spared, however, because of her young age and her status as Huo's granddaughter.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Late reign
1 CONT
1 CONT After the incident, Huo stamped out anyone who could be considered to be a conspirator, gaining a reputation for autocracy and heavy-handedness. The victims included two ministers, Wang Ping (??) and Xu Ren (??). The relationship 
1 CONC between Huo and Emperor Zhao remained a positive one, however.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 77 BC, a controversial incident involving the Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former-Soviet central Asia) kingdom of Loulan (on northeastern edge of the Taklamakan desert) would unfold itself, although whether Emperor Zhao played any
1 CONC  role in the decision-making is unclear. A few years earlier, the King of Loulan had died, and with Xiongnu support, one of his sons, Angui (??) succeeded him, and Angui started a policy of befriending Xiongnu and resisting Han, p
1 CONC articularly because Luolan's geographical location meant that it was often ordered by Han to escort its imperial messengers, who were also rude to Luolan officials. Huo sent an imperial messenger, Fu Jiezi (???) to assassinate Ang
1 CONC ui. Fu accomplished this by claiming that he was there to reward Xiyu kings with jewels and other precious items, and then, setting a private meeting up with Angui, he stabbed him in the heart, and then, warning that any further a
1 CONC ction would bring a large Chinese army, he got the Loulan nobles to submit and make a brother of Angui, Weituqi (???), who was friendly to Han, king. Loulan was renamed Shanshan. (This incident was controversial in Chinese history
1 CONC  in that many historians believed that this was one incident in which an assassination of a foreign king was thoroughly unjustified, particularly in the method it was carried out -- using jewels as bait. Other historians believed 
1 CONC that Angui should be punished for his failure to submit.)
1 CONT
1 CONT In 74 BC, Emperor Zhao died without a son, and this would lead to a succession problem. After a short duration in which the unsuitable Prince He of Changyi became emperor, the throne was finally given to Emperor Zhao's grandnephew
1 CONC  -- former Crown Prince Ju's grandson -- Liu Bingyi (???), who would ascend the throne as Emperor Xuan.

1 CONT Emperor Wu of Han (???, 156 BC[1]–March 29, 87 BC), personal name Liu Che (??), was the seventh emperor of the Han Dynasty in China, ruling from 141 BC to 87 BC. Emperor Wu is best remembered for the vast territorial expansion tha

1 CONT [edit] Background, birth, and years as crown prince
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wu was born as Prince Che to Emperor Jing and one of his favorite concubines, Consort Wang Zhi in 156 BC. His mother had initially been married once, to a Jin Wangsun (???) and had given birth to a daughter. However, her m
1 CONC other Zang Er (??) (a granddaughter of one-time Prince of Yan, Zang Tu (??), under Emperor Gao) was told by a fortuneteller that both Wang Zhi and her sister would one day become extremely honored. Zang got the idea to offer them 
1 CONC to then-Crown Prince Liu Qi (later Emperor Jing) and forcibly divorced Wang Zhi from her husband to do so. He was born shortly after Prince Qi became emperor. When Consort Wang was pregnant, she claimed that she dreamed of a sun f
1 CONC alling into her womb. In 153 BC, Prince Che was created the Prince of Jiaodong.
1 CONT
1 CONT As Emperor Jing's Empress Bo had no sons, his oldest son Liu Rong (??), born of his other favorite concubine Consort Li (??), was created crown prince in 153 BC. Consort Li was arrogant and jealous, and she hoped to become princes
1 CONC s after Empress Bo was deposed in 151 BC. However, her lack of tact would give Consort Wang a break. When Consort Li, out of a grudge to Emperor Jing's sister Princess Liu Piao (??), refused to let her son marry Princess Piao's da
1 CONC ughter Chen Jiao, Consort Wang took the opportunity and had Chen Jiao betrothed to Prince Che. Princess Piao then began incessantly criticize Consort Li for her jealousy — pointing out that, if Consort Li became empress dowager, m
1 CONC any concubines might suffer the fates of Consort Qi, Emperor Gao's favorite concubine who was tortured and killed by Emperor Gao's wife Empress Dowager Lü after Emperor Gao's death. Emperor Jing eventually agreed, and he deposed P
1 CONC rince Rong from his position in 150 BC. Consort Li died in anger. That year, Consort Wang was created empress, and Prince Che the crown prince. Given his young age, there was not much record of any accomplishments by him while bei
1 CONC ng crown prince.
1 CONT
1 CONT When Emperor Jing died in 141 BC, Crown Prince Che succeeded to the throne as Emperor Wu at age 15.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Early reign: the young years
1 CONT
1 CONT After Emperor Wu ascended the throne, his grandmother Empress Dowager Dou became the grand empress dowager, and his mother Empress Wang became the empress dowager. He made his wife (and cousin, with Empress Chen being the daughter
1 CONC  of his aunt) Chen Jiao empress.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 140 BC, Emperor Wu conducted an imperial examination of over 100 young scholars recommended by officials. This event would prove to have a major impact on Chinese history, as it was the official start of the establishment of Co
1 CONC nfucianism as official imperial doctrine. This came about because a young Confucian scholar, Dong Zhongshu, was evaluated to be have submitted the best essay, in which he advocated the establishment of Confucianism. It is unclear 
1 CONC whether Emperor Wu, in his young age, actually determined this, or whether this was the result of machinations of the prime minister Wei Wan (??), who was himself a Confucian. However, the fact that several other young scholars wh
1 CONC o scored highly on the examination (but interestingly enough, not Dong) later became trusted advisors for Emperor Wu would appear to suggest that Emperor Wu himself at least had some actual participation.[3]
1 CONT
1 CONT The first few years of Emperor Wu's reign saw the administration dominated by three figures — his grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Dou, his mother Empress Dowager Wang, and her half-brother Tian Fen (??), who was created Marquess
1 CONC  of Wu'an and made the commander of the armed forces after Emperor Wu became emperor. However, even during these years, Emperor Wu found chances to assert himself at times but found himself occasionally curbed by them. For example
1 CONC , in 139 BC, when Confucian officials Zhao Wan (??) and Wang Zang (??), who were disliked by the grand empress dowager because she was an adherent to Taoism rather than Confucianism, advised the emperor to no longer consult the gr
1 CONC and empress dowager, she had them investigated and tried for corruption, and they committed suicide. Generally, however, Emperor Wu was constantly on the look out for young officials, around his age, whose suggestions for governin
1 CONC g the state that he agreed with, and he took them into a close circle and promoted them out of normal seniority rotations, but unlike some other emperors in history who carried out these techniques, he was also not hesitant to rem
1 CONC ind these advisors that he was their overlord — including punishing them severely or even executing them if they were found to have been corrupt or have hidden even something minor from him. On the other hand, he respected those o
1 CONC fficials who did not flatter him and would honestly rebuke him when they saw fit, the most famous of whom was Ji An (??), whose comments were brutally honest and offensive in many ways, but whose integrity he respected. He also sh
1 CONC owed typical young male rebelliousness at times, often sneaking out of the capital disguised as a marquess, to hunt and sightsee.
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wu's marriage to Empress Chen was initially a happy one — so much so that he once boasted to her mother, Princess Piao, that he would build a golden house for Empress Chen. (This led to the Chinese idiom "putting Jiao in a
1 CONC  golden house" (????), which, however, became a term for keeping a mistress rather than a wife.) However, this did not last, at least partly because Empress Chen never bore him a son, even after she was treated by physicians. Late
1 CONC r, while visiting his sister Princess Pingyang, he was entertained by a female singer/dancer Wei Zifu (???), the daughter of one of the princess' lady servants, and Princess Pingyang offered Wei to become one of Emperor Wu's conso
1 CONC rts. She became his favorite. Empress Chen was so jealous that she attempted suicide several times, but each time she failed; each attempt made Emperor Wu more angry at her. Princess Piao, in order to avenge her daughter, tried to
1 CONC  have Consort Wei's brother Wei Qing (??) kidnapped and secretly executed, but Wei Qing was saved in time by his friends. Emperor Wu then made Wei Qing one of his close attendants and later a general.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 135 BC, after Grand Empress Dowager Dou died, Emperor Wu began to assert himself even more. While Empress Dowager Wang and Tian Feng were still influential, they found that they no longer had as much control over the emperor as
1 CONC  they formerly did.
1 CONT
1 CONT Around the same time, Emperor Wu started to show will and aptitude for territorial expansion. The first example came in 138 BC, when Minyue (modern Fujian) attacked Donghai (modern Zhejiang) and Donghai sought help from Han, Emper
1 CONC or Wu acted quickly to try to relieve Donghai, over Tian's opposition. Upon hearing news of Han's expedition force being dispatched, Minyue withdrew. Fearful of another Minyue attack, Luo Wang (??), the King of Donghai, purportedl
1 CONC y requested that his people be allowed to relocate into China proper, and Emperor Wu relocated them to the region between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. In 135 BC, when Minyue attacked Nanyue, Nanyue also sought assistance from Han 
1 CONC even though it probably had enough strength to defend itself — a sign of submission to the emperor's authority. Emperor Wu was greatly pleased by this gesture, and he dispatched an expedition force to attack Minyue, over the objec
1 CONC tion of one of his key advisors, Liu An, a royal relative and the Prince of Huainan. Minyue nobles, fearful of the massive Chinese force, assassinated their king Luo Ying (??) and sought peace. In a stroke of genius, Emperor Wu im
1 CONC posed a dual-monarchy system on Minyue by creating kings out of Luo Ying's brother Luo Yushan (???) and grandson Luo Chou (??), thus ensuring internal discord in Minyue. As to Xiongnu, he maintained heqin for sometime.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Maturity in reign and territorial expansion
1 CONT
1 CONT The peace with Xiongnu would not last, however, because Emperor Wu was not satisfied with what he saw as appeasement of the Xiongnufongfuzongzu. In 133 BC, at the suggestion of Wang Hui (??), the minister of vassal affairs, he had
1 CONC  his generals set a trap for the Xiongnu Chanyu Junchen (??). Under the plan, a power local gentleman, Nie Yi (??) from Mayi (??, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi) falsely claimed to offer Mayi to Xiongnu after killing the county magist
1 CONC rate to try to entice Chanyu Junchen into advancing on Mayi, while Han forces hid around Mayi to be ready to surprise the chanyu. The plan failed when a soldier captured by Xiongnu disclosed the entire plan to Chanyu Junchen, who 
1 CONC then withdrew quickly before the Han forces could ambush him. This ended the peace between Han and Xiongnu, and for years there were continued border skirmishes even though, oddly, the states remained trade partners.

1 CONT
1 CONT Another major battle was pitched in 129 BC when Xiongnu attacked the Commandery of Shanggu (??, roughly modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei), Emperor Wu dispatched four generals, Li Guang (??), Gongsun Ao (???), Gongsun He (???) and Wei Qin
1 CONC g (??), each leading a 10,000-strong cavalry against Xiongnu. Both Li Guang and Gongsun Ao suffered major losses at Xiongnu's hands, and Gongsun He failed to find and engage the enemy, but Wei Qing distinguished himself with a lon
1 CONC g-distance raid on a Xiongnu holy site and was promoted to a larger command. In 127 BC, a force commanded by Wei defeated a substantial Xiongnu force and allowed Han to occupy the Shuofang (??) region (modern western central Inner
1 CONC  Mongolia centering Ordos). The city of Shuofang (??) was built, and would later become a key post from which offensives against Xiongnu would be launched. When Xiongnu tried to attack Shuofang in 124 BC, Wei surprised them by att
1 CONC acking them from the rear and took about 15,000 captives — and at this battle, his nephew Huo Qubing distinguished himself in battle and was given his own command. In 121 BC, Huo had a major victory over the Xiongnu Princes of Hun
1 CONC xie (???) and Xiutu (???) — which had unforeseen good results for Han. When Chanyu Yizhixie (???) heard of the loss, he wanted to punish those princes harshly. The Prince of Hunxie, fearful of such punishment, after being unable t
1 CONC o persuade the Prince of Xiutu, killed the Prince of Xiutu and surrendered his forces, which then controlled the Gansu region, to Han, and this turned out to be a major blow to Xiongnu, robbing Xiongnu of a major grazing region an
1 CONC d other natural resources. Emperor Wu established five commanderies over the region and encouraged Chinese to relocate to the Gansu region, which has remained in Chinese hands ever since. The region would also become important sta
1 CONC ging grounds for the subjugation of Xiyu (??, modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia).
1 CONT
1 CONT The exploration into Xiyu was first started in 139 BC, that Emperor Wu commissioned Zhang Qian to seek out the Kingdom of Yuezhi, which had been expelled by Xiongnu from the modern Gansu region, to entice it to return to its ances
1 CONC tral lands with promises of Han military assistance, in order to fight against Xiongnu together. Zhang was immediately captured by Xiongnu once he ventured into the desert, but was able to escape around 129 BC and eventually made 
1 CONC it to Yuezhi, which by then had relocated to Samarkand. While Yuezhi refused to return, it and several other kingdoms in the area, including Dayuan (Kokand) and Kangju, established diplomatic relationships with Han. Zhang was able
1 CONC  to deliver his report to Emperor Wu when he arrived back in the capital Chang'an in 126 BC after a second and shorter captivity by Xiongnu. After the Prince of Hunxie surrendered the Gansu region, the path to Xiyu became clear, a
1 CONC nd regular embassies between Han and the Xiyu kingdoms commenced.
1 CONT
1 CONT Another expansion plan, this one aimed at the southwest, was soon initiated as well. The impetus for this expansion was aimed at eventual conquest of Nanyue, which was viewed as an unreliable vassal, by first obtaining the submiss
1 CONC ion the southwestern tribal kingdoms — the largest of which was Yelang (modern Zunyi, Guizhou) — so that a route for a potential back-stabbing attack on Nanyue could be made. The Han ambassador Tang Meng (??) was able to secure th
1 CONC e submission of these tribal kingdoms by giving their kings gifts, and Emperor Wu established the Commandery of Jianwei (??, headquarters in modern Yibin, Sichuan) to govern over the tribes, but eventually abandoned it after being
1 CONC  unable to cope with native revolts. Later, after Zhang Qian returned from the western region, part of his report indicated that by going through the southwestern kingdoms, embassies could reach Shendu (India) and Anxi (Parthia) e
1 CONC asier. Encouraged by the report, in 122 BC, Emperor Wu sent ambassadors to try to again persuade Yelang and Dian (?, modern eastern Yunnan) into submission.
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wu also made an aborted expansion into the Korean Peninsula by establishing the Commandery of Canghai (??), but abandoned it in 126 BC.
1 CONT
1 CONT It was also during this time that Emperor Wu began to show a fascination with immortality, and he began to associate with magicians who claimed to be able to, if they could find the proper ingredients, create divine pills that wou
1 CONC ld confer immortality. However, he himself punished others' use of magic severely. In 130 BC, for example, when Empress Chen was found to have retained witches to curse Consort Wei and to try to regain Emperor Wu's affections, he 
1 CONC had her deposed and the witches executed.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 128 BC, Consort Wei bore Emperor Wu his first-born son, Liu Ju. She was created empress later that year, and he was created crown prince in 122 BC.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 122 BC, Liu An, the Prince of Huainan (a previously trusted advisor of Emperor Wu), and his brother Liu Ci (??), the Prince of Hengshan, were accused of plotting treason. Both of them committed suicide, and their families and a

1 CONT
1 CONT In 119 BC, Emperor Wu broke the normal pattern of reacting against Xiongnu attacks, by making a major excursion against Xiongnu's headquarters. Wei and Huo's forces were able to make a direct assault on Chanyu Yizhixie's forces, n
1 CONC early capturing him and annihilating his forces. It was at this battle, however, that the famous general Li Guang, whose fortunes had been effectively sabotaged by Wei (who, as the supreme commander, had intentionally ordered him 
1 CONC to go through a region without Xiongnu forces but which lacked food and water, causing Li's forces to become lost and unable to join the main forces), committed suicide after being told that he would be arrested for his failures. 
1 CONC Even though both Wei and Huo were successful, Emperor Wu particularly praised Huo and rewarded him with many others; it was from this point on that Huo began to receive primacy over the forces over his uncle Wei. After Xiongnu suf
1 CONC fered these heavy losses, the Canyu sought heqin peace with Han again, but broke off peace talks after Han made it clear that it wanted Xiongnu to become a vassal instead.
1 CONT
1 CONT Around the same time, perhaps as a sign of what would be to come, Emperor Wu began to trust governing officials who were harsh in their punishments. For example, one of those officials, Yi Zong (??), when he became the governor of
1 CONC  the Commandery of Dingxiang (part of modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), executed 200 prisoners even though they had not committed capital crimes — and then executed their friends who happened to be visiting as well. Emperor Wu came 
1 CONC to believe that this would be the most effective method to maintain social order and so put these officials in power. A famous wrongful execution happened in 117 BC, the victim of which was the minister of agriculture Yan Yi (??).
1 CONC  Yan had previously offended the emperor by opposing a plan to effectively extort double tributes out of princes and marquesses — by requiring them to place their tributes on white deer skin, which the central government would sel
1 CONC l them at an exorbantly high price. Later, Yan was falsely accused of committing a crime, and during the investigation, it became known that once, when a friend of Yan's criticized a law promulgated by the emperor, Yan, while not 
1 CONC saying anything, moved his lips. Yan was executed for "internal defamation" of the emperor, and this caused the officials to be fearful and willing to flatter the emperor.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Further territorial expansion, old age, and paranoia

1 CONT Starting about 113 BC, Emperor Wu appeared to begin to display further signs of abusing his power. He began to incessantly tour the commanderies, initially nearby Chang'an, but later extending to much farther places, worshipping t
1 CONC he various gods on the way, perhaps again in the search of immortality. He also had a succession of magicians whom he honored with great things, even, in one case, making one a marquess and marrying a daughter to him. (That magici
1 CONC an, Luan Da (??), after he was exposed to be a fraud, however, was executed.) Emperor Wu's expenditures on these tours and magical adventures put a great strain on the national treasury and caused difficulties on the locales that 
1 CONC he visited, twice causing the governors of commanderies to commit suicide after they were unable to supply the emperor's entire train.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 112 BC, a crisis in the Kingdom of Nanyue (modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam) would erupt that would lead to military intervention by Emperor Wu. At that time, the King Zhao Xing (??) and his mother Queen Dowager 
1 CONC Jiu (???) — a Chinese woman whom Zhao Xing's father Zhao Yingqi (???) had married while he served as an ambassador to Han — were both in favor of becoming incorporated into Han. This was opposed by the senior prime minister Lü Jia
1 CONC  (??), who wanted to maintain the kingdom's independence. Queen Dowager Jiu tried to goad the Chinese ambassadors into killing Lü, but the Chinese ambassadors were hesitant to do so. When Emperor Wu sent a 2,000-men force, led by 
1 CONC Han Qianqiu (???) and Queen Dowager Jiu's brother Jiu Le (??), to try to assist the king and the queen dowager, Lü staged a coup d'etat and had the king and the queen dowager killed. He made another son of Zhao Yingqi, Zhao Jiande
1 CONC  (???), king. He then annihilated the Han forces under Han and Jiu. Several months later, Emperor Wu commissioned a five-pronged attack against Nanyue. In 111 BC, the Han forces captured the Nanyue capital Panyu (??, modern Guangz
1 CONC hou) and annexed the entire Nanyue territory into Han, establishing nine commanderies.
1 CONT
1 CONT Later that year, one of the co-kings of Minyue (modern Fujian), Luo Yushan, fearful that Han would next attack his kingdom, made a preemptive attack against Han, capturing a number of towns in the former Nanyue and in the other bo
1 CONC rder commanderies. In 110 BC, under Han military pressure, his co-king Luo Jugu (???) assassinated Luo Yushan and surrendered the kingdom to Han. However, Emperor Wu did not establish commanderies in Minyue's former territory, but
1 CONC  moved its people to the region between Yangtze and Huai Rivers.
1 CONT
1 CONT Later that year, Emperor Wu, at great expense, carried out the ancient ceremony of fengshan (??) at Mount Tai — ceremonies to worship heaven and earth, and to offer a secret petition to the gods of heaven and earth, presumably see
1 CONC king immortality. (He decreed that he would return to Mount Tai every five years to repeat the ceremony, but only did once, in 98 BC; still, many palaces were built for him and the princes to accommodate the anticipated cycles of 
1 CONC the ceremony.)
1 CONT
1 CONT It was around this time that, in reaction to the large expenditures by Emperor Wu that had exhausted the national treasury, his agricultural minister Sang Hongyang (???) conceived of a plan that many dynasties would repeat later, 
1 CONC by creating national monopolies for salt and iron. The national treasury would further purchase other consumer goods when the prices were low and sell them when the prices were high at profit, thus replenishing the treasury while 
1 CONC at the same time making sure the price fluctuation would not be too great.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 109 BC, Emperor Wu would start yet another territorial expansion campaign. Nearly a century ago, a Chinese general Wei Man (??; Hangul: ??) had established a kingdom, which he named Chaoxian or Joseon (??/??) at Wangxian (??, m
1 CONC odern Pyongyang), which became a nominal Han vassal. A conflict would erupt in 109 BC, when Wei Man's grandson Wei Youqu (???) refused to permit the Kingdom of Chen (?)'s ambassadors to reach China through his territories. When Em
1 CONC peror Wei sent an ambassador She He (??) to Wangxian to negotiate right of passage with King Youqu, King Youqu refused and had a general escort She back to Han territory — but when they got close to Han borders, She assassinated t
1 CONC he general and claimed to Emperor Wu that he had defeated Joseon in battle, and Emperor Wu, unaware of his deception, made him the military commander of the Commandery of Liaodong (modern central Liaoning). King Youqu, offended, m
1 CONC ade a raid on Liaodong and killed She. In response, Emperor Wu commissioned a two-pronged attack, one by land and one by sea, against Joseon. Initially, Joseon offered to become a vassal, but peace negotiations broke down by the C
1 CONC hinese forces' refusal to let a Joseon force escort its crown prince to Chang'an to pay tribute to Emperor Wu. The two forces attacking Joseon were unable to coordinate well with each other and eventually suffered large losses. Ev
1 CONC entually the commands were merged, and Wangxian fell. Han took over the Joseon lands and established four commanderies.
1 CONT
1 CONT Also in 109 BC, Emperor Wu sent an expeditionary force against the Kingdom of Dian (modern eastern Yunnan), planning on conquering it, but when the King of Dian surrendered, Dian was incorporated into Han territory with the King o
1 CONC f Dian being permitted to keep his traditional authority and title. Emperor Wu established five commanderies over Dian and the other nearby kingdoms.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 108 BC, Emperor Wu sent general Zhao Ponu (???) on a campaign to Xiyu, and he forced the Kingdoms of Loulan (on northeast border of the Taklamakan Desert) and Cheshi (modern Turpan, Xinjiang) into submission. In 105 BC, Emperor
1 CONC  Wu gave a princess from a remote collateral imperial line to Kunmo (??), the King of Wusun (Issyk Kol basin) in marriage, and she later married his grandson and successor Qinqu (??), creating a strong and stable alliance between 
1 CONC Han and Wusun. The various Xiyu kingdoms would also strengthen their relationships with Han, in general. An infamous Han war against the nearby Kingdom of Dayuan (Kokand) would soon erupt in 104 BC. Dayuan refused to give in to Em
1 CONC peror Wu's commands to surrender its best horses, Emperor Wu's ambassadors were then executed when they insulted the King of Dayuan after his refusal. Emperor Wu commissioned Li Guangli (???), the brother of a favorite concubine C
1 CONC onsort Li, as a general against Dayuan. In 103 BC, Li Guangli's forces, without adequate supplies, suffered a humiliating loss against Dayuan, but in 102 BC, Li was able to put a devastating siege on its capital by cutting off wat
1 CONC er supplies to the city, forcing Dayuan's surrender of its prized horses. This Han victory further intimidated the Xiyu kingdoms into submission.
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wu also made attempts to try to intimidate Xiongnu into submission, but even though peace negotiations were ongoing, Xiongnu would never actually submit to becoming a Han vassal during Emperor Wu's reign. In 103 BC, indeed
1 CONC , Chanyu Er would surround Zhao Ponu and capture his entire army — the first major Xiongnu victory since Wei Qing and Huo Qubing nearly captured the chanyu in 119 BC. Following Han's victory over Dayuan in 102 BC, however, Xiongnu
1 CONC  became concerned that Han could then concentrate against it, and made peace overtures, but peace negotiations would be destroyed when the Han deputy ambassador Zhang Sheng (??) was discovered to have conspired to assassinate Chan
1 CONC yu Qiedihou (???). The ambassador, the later-famed Su Wu (??) would be detained for two decades. In 99 BC, Emperor Wu commissioned another expedition force aimed at crushing Xiongnu, but both prongs of the expedition force would f
1 CONC ail — Li Guangli's forces became trapped but was able to free itself and withdraw, while Li Ling (??), Li Guang's grandson, after inflicting large losses on Xiongnu forces, was captured. Later, believing incorrectly that Li Ling h
1 CONC ad surrendered and was giving Xiongnu military advice, Emperor Wu had Li's clan executed. Li's friend, the famed historian Sima Qian (whom Emperor Wu already bore a grudge against because Sima's Shiji was not as flattering to Empe
1 CONC ror Wu and his father Emperor Jing as Emperor Wu wanted), who tried to defend Li's actions, was castrated.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 106 BC, in order the further better organize the territories, including both the previously-existing empire and the newly conquered territories, Emperor Wu divided the empire into 13 prefectures (zhou, ?), but without governors
1 CONC  or prefectural governments at this time — that would come later. Rather, he assigned a supervisor to each prefecture, who would visit the commanderies and principalities in the prefecture on a rotating basis to investigate corrup
1 CONC tion and disobedience with imperial edicts.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 104 BC, Emperor Wu built the luxurious Jianzhang Palace (???) — a massive structure that was intended to make him closer to the gods. He would later reside at that palace exclusively rather than the traditional Weiyang Palace (
1 CONC ???), which Xiao He had built during the reign of Emperor Gao.
1 CONT
1 CONT About 100 BC, due to the heavy taxation and military burdens imposed by Emperor Wu's incessant military campaigns and luxury spending, there were many peasant revolts throughout the empire. Emperor Wu issued an edict that was inte
1 CONC nded at suppressing the peasant revolts, by making officials whose commanderies saw unsuppressed peasant revolts liable with their lives — but which had the exact opposite effect, since it became impossible to suppress all of the 
1 CONC revolts, and the officials would merely cover up the existence of the revolts.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 96 BC, a series of witchcraft persecutions would begin. Large numbers of people, many of whom were high officials and their families, were accused of witchcraft and executed, usually with their clans. The first trial began with
1 CONC  General Gongsun Ao and his wife, leading to the execution of their clan. Soon, these witchcraft persecutions would become intertwined in the succession struggles and erupt into a major catastrophe.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] The Crown Prince Ju revolt
1 CONT
1 CONT In 94 BC, Emperor Wu's youngest son Liu Fuling was born to a favorite concubine of his, Consort Zhao. Emperor Wu was ecstatic in having a child at his advanced age (62), and because Consort Zhao purportedly had a pregnancy that la
1 CONC sted 14 months long — the same length as the mythical Emperor Yao — he named Consort Zhao's palace gate "Gate of Yao's Mother." This led to speculations that he, due to his favor for Consort Zhao and Prince Fuling, wanted to make 
1 CONC Prince Fuling crown prince instead. While there was no evidence that he actually intended to do anything of the such, over the next few years, there began to be conspirators against Crown Prince Ju and Empress Wei.
1 CONT
1 CONT Up to this point, there had been a strong and cordial relationship between Emperor Wu and his crown prince. Even though Emperor Wu, as he grew older, had less and less attraction to Empress Wei, he continued to respect her and her
1 CONC  son. Whenever Emperor Wu was outside the capital, he would leave important affairs for Crown Prince Ju to handle, and when he got back to the capital, Emperor Wu usually had no disagreements with Prince Ju's decisions and would n
1 CONC ot overrule them. However, as Emperor Wu grew older and became more trusting of harsh officials, those officials often raised objections against Prince Ju's more lenient rulings. Further, after Wei Qing died in 106 BC, Prince Ju h
1 CONC ad no strong allies left in the government, and the officials who disagreed with his lenient attitudes began to publicly defame him and plot against him. Also around this time, Emperor Wu was becoming more and more isolated, spend
1 CONC ing time mostly with young concubines, away from his sons and Empress Wei.
1 CONT
1 CONT One of the conspirators against Prince Ju would be Jiang Chong (??), the head of the secret intelligence, who once had a run-in with Prince Ju after arresting one of Prince Ju's assistants for improper use of an imperial right of 
1 CONC way. It appears likely that Jiang was behind many of the witchcraft accusations against important persons — including Prince Ju's sisters Princesses Zhuyi and Yangshi and cousin Wei Kang (??) (Wei Qing's son), who were executed in
1 CONC  91 BC after being accused of witchcraft. One other conspirator was Emperor Wu's guard Su Wen (??), who had falsely accused Prince Ju of committing adultery with Emperor Wu's junior concubines.
1 CONT
1 CONT Jiang and Su decided on using witchcraft as the excuse to move against Prince Ju. Jiang, with approval from Emperor Wu, who was then at his summer palace in Ganquan (??, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), searched through various palac
1 CONC es, ostensibly for witchcraft items, eventually reaching Prince Ju's palace. He planted dolls and a piece of cloth with mysterious writing in Prince Ju's palace, and then announced that he found them there. Prince Ju was shocked. 
1 CONC He considered his options, and his teacher Shi De (??), invoking the story of Ying Fusu and raising the possibility that Emperor Wu might already be deceased, suggested that Prince Ju start an uprising. Prince Ju initially hesitat
1 CONC ed and wanted to speedily proceed to Ganquan to try to see his father to explain himself, but he found out that Jiang's messengers were already on their way. He decided to accept Shi's suggestion.
1 CONT
1 CONT Prince Ju then sent an individual to impersonate a messenger from Emperor Wu to arrest Jiang and his coconspirators — except for Su, who escaped. After they were arrested, Prince Ju personally killed Jiang. He then led the guards 
1 CONC of his and Empress Wei's palaces and prepared to defend himself. Su fled to Ganquan and accused Prince Ju of treason. Emperor Wu, not believing it to be true and correctly (at this point) believing that Prince Ju had merely been a
1 CONC ngry at Jiang, sent a messenger back to Chang'an to summon Prince Ju. The messenger did not dare to proceed to Chang'an, but instead returned and falsely reported to Emperor Wu that he fled because Prince Ju was going to kill him.
1 CONC  By now enraged, Emperor Wu ordered his nephew, Prime Minister Liu Qumao (???), to put down the rebellion. The forces battled for five days, but Liu Qumao's forces prevailed after it became clear that Prince Ju did not have his fa
1 CONC ther's authorization. Prince Ju fled the capital.
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wu continued to be enraged and ordered that Prince Ju be tracked down, but after a junior official risked his life and spoke on Prince Ju's behalf, Emperor Wu's anger began to subside, but he had not yet issued a pardon fo
1 CONC r Prince Ju when Prince Ju, having fled to Hu (??, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) and surrounded by troops, committed suicide by hanging. Two of his sons died with him.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Late reign and death
1 CONT
1 CONT Even after Jiang Chong and Prince Ju both died, however, the witchcraft affairs would continue. One final prominent victim was the general Li Guangli, who had prior victories over Dayuan and Xiongnu. In 90 BC, while Li was on a ca
1 CONC mpaign against Xiongnu, an eunuch falsely accused Li and his political ally, Prime Minister Liu Qumao, of witchcraft. Liu and his family were immediately executed. Li's family was arrested. Li, hoping to save himself, used risky t
1 CONC actics to try to have a major victory against Xiongnu to try to get Emperor Wu to change his mind, but failed when some of his senior officers mutinied. On his retreat, he was ambushed by Xiongnu forces, and he surrendered. His cl
1 CONC an was slaughtered.
1 CONT
1 CONT By this time, however, Emperor Wu had begun to realize that the witchcraft accusations were often false accusations. In 89 BC, when Tian Qianqiu (???), then the superintendent of Emperor Gao's temple, wrote a report claiming that 
1 CONC Emperor Gao told him in a dream that Prince Ju should have only been whipped, not killed, Emperor Wu had a revelation about what happened, and he had Su killed by burning and Jiang's family executed. He also made Tian prime minist
1 CONC er. However, although he claimed to miss Prince Ju greatly, he did not at this time rectify the situation where Prince Ju's surviving progeny, a grandson named Liu Bingyi, languished in prison as a child.
1 CONT
1 CONT The political scene now greatly changed. Tian was in favor of resting the troops and the people and promoting agriculture, and under his recommendation, several agricultural experts were made important members of the administratio
1 CONC n. Wars and territorial expansion generally ceased.
1 CONT
1 CONT By 88 BC, Emperor Wu was ill, but with Prince Ju dead, there was no clear successor. Liu Dan, the Prince of Yan, was Emperor Wu's oldest surviving son, but Emperor Wu considered both him and his younger brother Liu Xu, the Prince 
1 CONC of Guangling, to be unsuitable, since neither respected laws. He decided on his youngest son, Liu Fuling, who was only six at that time. He therefore also chose a potential regent in Huo Guang, whom he considered to be capable and
1 CONC  faithful. He also ordered Prince Fuling's mother, Consort Zhao, arrested and executed, in fear that she would become an uncontrollable empress dowager like Empress Lü (??). He entrusted Huo with the regency of Fuling. At Huo's su
1 CONC ggestion, he also made ethnic Xiongnu official Jin Ridi and general Shangguang Jie coregents. He died in 87 BC, shortly after creating Prince Fuling crown prince. Crown Prince Fuling then succeeded to the throne as Emperor Zhao.
1 CONT
1 CONT Because Emperor Wu did not create anyone empress after Empress Wei committed suicide and left no instruction on who should be enshrined in his temple with him, Huo, after Emperor Wu's death, considered what his wishes would have b
1 CONC een, chose to enshrine Consort Li with Emperor Wu. They lie buried in the Maoling mound, the most famous of the so-called Chinese pyramids.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Legacy
1 CONT
1 CONT Historians generally treated Emperor Wu with ambivalence. On one hand, he was recognized for neutralizing the Xiongnu threat and expanding the Chinese territory. During his reign, China roughly doubled her size, and most of the te
1 CONC rritories he annexed became part of China proper permanently. His other, perhaps greater, legacy was the promotion of Confucianism. For the first time in history, Confucianism became the dominant thought in the Chinese government,
1 CONC  and it remained so until the overthrow of monarchy in 1911.
1 CONT
1 CONT On the other hand, many historians criticized Emperor Wu for extravagancy, superstition, and the burdens his policies forced on the population. As such he was often compared to Qin Shihuang.[5] Just like Qin Shihuang he used a Leg
1 CONC alist system of reward and punishment to govern his empire. The punishment for perceived failures and disloyalty was often exceedingly harsh. Out of the twelve Prime Ministers appointed by Emperor Wu, three were executed and two c
1 CONC ommitted suicide while holding the post; another was executed in retirement. Castration as a way of punishment was also applied relatively frequently during Emperor Wu's reign.
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wu's political reform resulted in the strengthening of the Emperor's power at expense of the Prime Minister's authority. Also, the post of shangshu (court secretaries) was elevated from merely managing documents to that of
1 CONC  the Emperor's close advisor, and it stayed this way until the end of monarchy.

1 CONT [edit] Bisexuality?
1 CONT
1 CONT Early in his reign, Emperor Wu greatly favored Han Yan (??), for no apparent reason, and he gave Han much wealth (although no official position at court). This, coupled with later references by officials trying to persuade Emperor
1 CONC  Ai against giving his male lover Dong Xian too much authority — during which those officials analogized Han's position to Dong's[6] — has led to speculation that Emperor Wu had a homosexual relationship with Han. It is quite poss
1 CONC ible, but also hardly proven based on available evidence. It should be noted that this relationship would lead to Han's death. As part of his favors on Han, Emperor Wu permitted him to ride in imperial wagons even when he was not 
1 CONC with Han. On one occasion, Han was riding such a wagon when Emperor Wu's brother, Liu Pengzu (???) the Prince of Zhao, encountered the wagon and, believing that Emperor Wu was inside, prostrated himself. Later, when he found out t
1 CONC hat Han, not Emperor Wu, was inside, he was greatly humiliated and complained to Empress Dowager Wang, who then had Han executed.

1 CONT
1 CONT Empress Wei Zifu (Traditional Chinese: ???; Simplified Chinese: ???; pinyin: Weì Zifu) (d. 91 BC), formally Wei Xihou (???), was an empress during Han Dynasty. She was Emperor Wu's second wife. She was the sister of the famed gene
1 CONC ral Wei Qing and aunt of Huo Qubing and stepaunt of Huo Guang.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Family background and early years
1 CONT
1 CONT Wei Zifu was born from humble means, as an illegitimate child. She therefore took the family name of her mother, who was a servant at the household of Princess Pingyang (????), Emperor Wu's sister. Her brother Wei Qing was also an
1 CONC  illegitimate child, of a different father. When Wei Zifu was still young, she became a singer at the princess' estate.
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wu initially loved his first wife, Empress Chen Jiao greatly but after Empress Chen was unable to bear him a son after years of marriage, she began to lose favor. Circa 139 BC, when Emperor Wu was visiting Princess Pingyan
1 CONC g, he saw Wei and was impressed by her beauty. The princess therefore offered her to him, and she became part of his concubinage. She became greatly favored over Empress Chen. Empress Chen became exceedingly jealous of her, and Em
1 CONC press Chen's mother, Princess Liu Piao (??) tried to take vengeance by kidnapping Consort Wei's brother Wei Qing, who was then a servant at a marquess' household, and she considered killing him. Wei Qing, however, was rescued from
1 CONC  the princess' estate by his friends, led by Gongsun Ao (???). In response, Emperor Wu made Wei Qing the head of the household at Jianzhang Palace, away from where the princess might be able to harm him. While being an imperial co
1 CONC ncubine, Consort Wei bore him three daughters.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 130 BC, Empress Chen was discovered to have retained witches to use witchcraft to try to restore her husband's love to her and to injure Consort Wei. Empress Chen was deposed, but Consort Wei was not made empress at this time, 
1 CONC because she, too, was sonless, as were the other concubines at the palace. in 128 BC, she finally bore him his first born son, Liu Ju. She was created empress later that year, and her son was created crown prince in 122 BC.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] As empress

1 CONT After Wei Zifu became empress, Emperor Wu honored her family greatly. Wei Qing was made a key general in the war effort against Xiongnu, and after he won some major victories, not only he, but also his three young sons, were made 
1 CONC marquesses. Similarly promoted and honored was her nephew Huo Qubing, a great general in his own right.
1 CONT
1 CONT As the years went by, the sexual attraction to Empress Wei by Emperor Wu would decrease tremendously. He favored several other concubines, including Consort Li (the sister of Li Guangli and Li Yannian) and Consort Zhao. However, h

1 CONT [edit] Early life and career as crown prince
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Jing was born to Emperor Wen, then Prince of Dai, and Consort Dou, one of his favorite consorts, in 188 BC. He was his father's oldest son. After his father became emperor in 180 BC, then-Prince Qi was created crown prince
1 CONC  in 179 BC. At the same time, his mother was created empress.
1 CONT
1 CONT In his childhood as crown prince, Prince Qi was praised for being compassionate. He was deeply influenced by his mother Empress Dou, who was a Taoist and required all of her children and grandchildren to study Taoist doctrines. He
1 CONC  also developed deep bonds with his older sister Princess Liu Piao (??) and his younger brother Liu Wu (??), both also born of Empress Dou.
1 CONT
1 CONT As Prince Qi grew in age, as was customary, he established his own household, and a member of his household, Chao Cuo (??), known for his intelligence and ruthless efficiency as well as his rhetorical talent, became a trusted advi
1 CONC sor of Prince Qi.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 157 BC, Emperor Wen died, and Prince Qi became emperor. In accordance with Emperor Wen's will, the period of mourning was shortened. Empress Dowager Bo became grand empress dowager, and Empress Dou became empress dowager. Princ

1 CONT [edit] Early reign
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Jing largely continued his father's policy of non-interference with the people and reduction of tax and other burdens. He continued his policy of reducing criminal penalties, and in 156 BC, in reaction to the reality that 
1 CONC his father's abolition of corporal punishments of cutting off nose and feet were in fact causing more people to die from whipping, reduced the number of whips that criminals would receive. (He would later reduce the penalty again 
1 CONC in 144 BC.) He also continued his father's policy of heqin (marriage treaties) with Xiongnu, which largely avoided large conflicts with that northern neighbor. However, one immediate issue confronting Emperor Jing was the power po
1 CONC ssessed by princes of collateral lines of the imperial clan. The princes often built up their own military strengths and resisted edicts issued by the emperor. This was already an issue in Emperor Wen's days, but Emperor Wen did n
1 CONC ot take any decisive actions on the issue.
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Jing did not designate a crown prince for the first few years of his reign, because Empress Bo did not have any sons. He publicly flirted with the idea of creating his younger brother Liu Wu, the Prince of Liang, crown pri
1 CONC nce, but this did not happen because of opposition by officials. However, Liu Wu was given many privileges not given to other princes.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] The Rebellion of the Seven States
1 CONT
1 CONT The issue of dealing with powerful princes would soon erupt into a war later known as the Rebellion of the Seven States. Emperor Jing already had an inimical relationship with his cousin-once-removed (the nephew of his grandfather
1 CONC  Emperor Gao) Liu Pi (??), the prince of the wealthy Principality of Wu (modern southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and northern Jiangxi), which enjoyed, among other natural resources, abundant copper and salt sup
1 CONC plies. While Emperor Jing was crown prince, Liu Pi's heir apparent Liu Xian (??) had been on an official visit to the capital Chang'an, and they gambled together. At the gambling table, Liu Xian offended then-Crown Prince Qi, and 
1 CONC Prince Qi threw a wooden board at Liu Xian, killing him. Liu Pi thus had great hatred for the new emperor.
1 CONT
1 CONT Chao Cuo's advice for Emperor Jing was to, using as excuses offenses that princes have committed which had generally been ignored by Emperor Wen, cut down the sizes of the principalities to make them less threatening. Chao explici
1 CONC tly contemplated the possibility that Wu and other principalities may rebel, but justified the action by asserting that if they were going to rebel, it would be better to let them rebel earlier than later, when they might be more 
1 CONC prepared. Under this theory, Emperor Jing, in 154 BC, carved out one commandery each from the Principalities of Chu (modern northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui) and Zhao and six counties from the Principality of Jiaoxi (roughly mo
1 CONC dern Weifang, Shandong), before carving two commanderies out of Wu.
1 CONT
1 CONT Wu did indeed start a rebellion, in alliance with Chu, Jiaoxi, Zhao, and three other smaller principalities -- Jiaodong (roughly modern Qingdao, Shandong), Zaichuan (part of modern Weifang, Shandong), and Jinan (modern Jinan, Shan
1 CONC dong). Two other principalities that originally agreed to join, Qi (modern central Shandong) and Jibei (modern northwestern Shandong), reneged at the final moment. Wu also sought assistance from the independent kingdoms of Donghai
1 CONC  (modern Zhejiang) and Minyue (modern Fujian), and both kingdoms contributed forces. Zhao sought assistance from Xiongnu, but while Xiongnu initially agreed to help, it did not actually enter the war.
1 CONT
1 CONT In accordance with instructions left by Emperor Wen, Emperor Jing commissioned Zhou Yafu as the commander of his armed forces to face the main rebel force -- joint forces of Wu and Chu. However, he soon panicked at the prospect of
1 CONC  losing, and at the suggestion of Chao Cuo's enemy Yuan Ang (??), he executed Chao to try to appease the seven princes, to no avail.
1 CONT
1 CONT Wu and Chu forces were fiercly attacking the Principality of Liang (modern eastern Henan), whose prince Liu Wu was Emperor Jing's beloved younger brother, and Emperor Jing ordered Zhou to immediately head to Liang to save it. Zhou
1 CONC  refused, reasoning that the proper strategy would involve first cutting off the Wu and Chu supply lines, thus starving them, so he headed to the northeast side of Liang and around the Wu and Chu forces to cut off their supplies. 
1 CONC The strategy was effective. Wu and Chu, unable to capture Liang quickly and realizing that their supplies were dwindling, headed northeast to attack Zhou. After being unable to get a decisive victory against Zhou, the Wu and Chu f
1 CONC orces collapsed from starvation. Liu Pi fled to Donghai, which killed him and sought peace with Han. Liu Wu, the Prince of Chu, committed suicide. The other principalities involved were all eventually defeated as well.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Middle reign and succession issues
1 CONT
1 CONT In 153 BC, because Empress Bo did not have a son, Emperor Jing created his oldest son Liu Rong (??) crown prince. This made Liu Rong's mother, Consort Li (??), who was one of Emperor Jing's favorite concubines, extremely arrogant.
1 CONC  She also thought she would be created empress, particularly after Empress Bo was deposed in 151 BC, following Grand Empress Dowager Bo's death. She hated Emperor Jing's sister Princess Liu Piao, because Princess Piao had often gi
1 CONC ven her brother beautiful women as concubines, drawing Consort Li's jealousy. When Princess Piao wanted to end this dispute by giving her daughter Chen Jiao (??) as wife to Prince Rong, Consort Li refused.
1 CONT
1 CONT Princess Pi, seeing the precarious state that she would be in if Consort Li became empress dowager one day, carried out an alternative plan. She gave Chen Jiao as wife to Liu Che, the son of Emperor Jing's other favorite concubine
1 CONC , Wang Zhi (??), the Prince of Jiaodong. She then incessantly criticized Consort Li for her jealousy -- pointing out that, if Consort Li became empress dowager, many concubines might suffer the fates of Consort Qi, Emperor Gao's f
1 CONC avorite concubine who was tortured and killed by Emperor Gao's wife Empress Dowager Lü after Emperor Gao's death. Emperor Jing eventually agreed, and he deposed Prince Rong from his position in 150 BC. Consort Li died in anger. Th
1 CONC at year, Consort Wang was created empress, and Prince Che the crown prince.
1 CONT
1 CONT Prince Rong would not be spared. In 148 BC, he was accused of intruding onto the grounds of his grandfather Emperor Wen's temple when building the walls to his palace. He was imprisoned and not permitted to write to his father. Hi
1 CONC s granduncle Dou Ying (??, Empress Dowager Dou's brother or cousin) slipped in a pen, and he wrote a letter and the committed suicide.
1 CONT
1 CONT A major incident involving another potential heir, Prince Wu of Liang, erupted in 148 BC as well. Prince Wu, because of his contributions to the victory during the Rebellion of the Seven States, was further given privilege to use 
1 CONC imperial ceremonies and colors. Members of his household encouraged him to seek to become crown prince. This was favored by Empress Dowager Dou as well, but opposed by officials, who believed such a move would bring instability to
1 CONC  dynastic succession. When Prince Wu sought permission to build a highway directly from his capital Suiyang (??, in modern Shangqiu, Henan) to Chang'an, the same officials, fearing that the highway might be used for military purpo
1 CONC ses if Liang rebelled, opposed it. Prince Wu had these officials assassinated. Emperor Jing was extremely angry and sent many investigators to Liang to track down the conspirators, whom Prince Wu eventually surrendered. Emperor Ji
1 CONC ng, afraid of offending his mother and still affectionate for his brother, pardoned Prince Wu but no longer considered him as possible heir.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Late reign
1 CONT
1 CONT The late reign of Emperor Jing was marked by an incident for which he was much criticized -- the death of Zhou Yafu, who had been instrumental in the victory against the Seven States. Zhou, later as prime minister, offended virtua
1 CONC lly every powerful figure around Emperor Jing -- his brother Prince Liu Wu and his mother Empress Dowager Dou (for refusing to save Liang first when Liang was sieged by Wu and Chu forces), and his wife Empress Wang and her brother
1 CONC  Wang Xin (??), whom Emperor Jing wanted to create a marquess but whose candidacy was rebuffed by Zhou. By 143 BC, he was retired when his son, in anticipation of his death, purchased retired armor and weapons from the imperial ar
1 CONC mery to serve as burial decorations. Zhou's son refused to pay the delivery workers, and the delivery workers, in retaliation, accused the Zhous of treason. Emperor Jing had Zhou Yafu arrested and interrogated, and the interrogato
1 CONC r, when told by Zhou that the armor and weapons were for burial purposes, accused him of "underground treason" -- i.e., ready to commit treason against the spirits of the emperors after he himself dies. Zhou committed suicide in p
1 CONC rison.
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Jing died in 141 BC. He was succeeded by Crown Prince Che (as Emperor Wu).
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Impact on Chinese history
1 CONT
1 CONT As forementioned, Emperor Jing was a complicated character. His reign, along with that of his father Emperor Wen, known as the Rule of Wen and Jing, was considered to be one of the golden ages in Chinese history. However, it is al
1 CONC so apparent from his actions that he lacked the warmth and openness his father had, and in many ways his reign was marked by political intrigue and treachery.

1 CONT As Emperor Jing's empress Empress Bo had no sons, his oldest son Liu Rong (??), born of his other favorite concubine Consort Li (??), was created crown prince in 153 BC. Consort Li was arrogant and jealous, and she hoped to become

1 CONC as defeated but who eluded capture, remained a threat, until Zhou Bo (??) killed him in battle in autumn 195 BC. It is not known whether at this time Prince Heng, who was then seven years old, was already in Dai, but it appeared l
1 CONC ikely, because his brother Liu Ruyi was the only prince at the time explicitly to have been recorded to be remaining at the capital Chang'an rather than being sent to his principality.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 181 BC, after Prince Heng's brother, Prince Liu Hui of Zhao, committed suicide over his marital problems, Grand Empress Dowager Lü, who was then in effective control of the imperial government, offered the more prosperous Princ
1 CONC ipality of Zhao to Prince Heng, but Prince Heng, judging correctly that she was intending on making her nephew Lü Lu prince, politely declined and indicated that he preferred remaining on the border. The grand empress dowager then
1 CONC  created Lü Lu Prince of Zhao.
1 CONT
1 CONT During these years, the Principality of Dai did in fact become a key position in the defense against Xiongnu, and Prince Heng became well-acquainted with Xiongnu customs and military strategies, although the extent of his own part
1 CONC icipation in military actions was unknown.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Ascension to the throne
1 CONT
1 CONT In 180 BC, after Grand Empress Dowager Lü died and the officials made a coup d'etat against her clan and slaughtered her clan (during the Lü Clan Disturbance), after some deliberation, the officials offered the imperial throne to 
1 CONC Prince Heng, rather than Prince Liu Xiang of Qi, the oldest grandson of Emperor Gao. The key to their decision was that Prince Xiang's maternal clan was domineering and might repeat the behaviors of the Lü clan, while the clan of 
1 CONC Prince Heng's maternal clan, the Bos, were considered to be kind and humble. After some hesitation, Prince Heng, then 23-years-old, accepted the throne as Emperor Wen. His nephew, Emperor Houshao, viewed as a mere puppet of Grand 
1 CONC Empress Dowager Lü and suspected of not being actually a son of Emperor Wen's older brother Emperor Hui, was deposed and executed.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Early reign
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wen quickly showed an aptitude to govern the empire with diligence, and appeared to be genuinely concerned for the People's welfare. Heavily influenced by his wife Empress Dou, who was an adherent to Taoism, Emperor Wen go
1 CONC verned the country with the general policies of non-intereference with the people and relaxed laws. His personal life was marked by thriftiness and general willingness to forgive. He was initially very deferential to Zhou Bo, Chen
1 CONC  Ping (??), and Guan Ying (??), who were instrumental in his accession, and they served as successive prime ministers.
1 CONT
1 CONT Examples of Emperor Wen's policies that showed kindness and concern for the people include:
1 CONT
1 CONT     * In 179 BC, he abolished the law that permitted the arrest and imprisonment of parents, wives, and siblings of criminals, with the exception for the crime of treason.
1 CONT     * In 179 BC, he created a governmental assistance program for those in need. Loans or tax exemptions were offered to widowers, widows, orphans, and seniors without children. He also ordered that monthly stipends of rice, wine,
1 CONC  and meat be given to seniors over 80 years in age, and that additional stipends of cloth and cotton be given to seniors over 90 years in age.
1 CONT     * In 179 BC, he made peace with Nanyue, whose king Zhao Tuo (??) Empress Dowager Lü had offended by an economic embargo and which therefore engaged in raids against the Principality of Changsha (modern Hunan) and the Commander
1 CONC y of Nan (modern Hubei). Emperor Wen accomplished this by writing humble yet assertive letters to Zhao offering peace with dignity and by caring for Zhao's relatives remaining in his native town of Zhending (??, in modern Shijiazh
1 CONC uang, Hebei).
1 CONT     * In 178 BC, after a solar eclipse (then viewed as a symbol of divine displeasure), he requested that officials give him honest criticism and recommend capable individuals for governmental positions. He also tried to decrease 
1 CONC mandatory taxes and hard labor.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 179 BC, after some hesitation (during which he, apparently influenced by the theory of chanrang (??), thought that maybe it would be more proper for him to find the wisest person in the empire and offer the throne to him, or th
1 CONC at he should consider offering the throne to his uncle Liu Jiao (??), the Prince of Chu; his cousin Liu Pi (??), the Prince of Wu; or his younger brother Liu Chang (??), the Prince of Huainan), he created his oldest son Liu Qi (??
1 CONC  or ?, later Emperor Jing) the Crown Prince and Prince Qi's mother, Consort Dou, Empress.
1 CONT
1 CONT In addition to Empress Dou, Emperor Wen also favored Consort Shen (???). Despite her favored state, however, she only wore simple dresses rather than elaborate designs, as a means of savings.
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wen, during the early part of his reign, was often impressed with suggestions tendered by a young official, Jia Yi (??), but opposed by senior officials, he did not promote Jia to particularlly high positions; rather, Jia 
1 CONC was put into a rotation as a teacher for various princes. Jia proposed dividing the larger principalities ruled by branch lines of the imperial family, a proposal that Emperor Wen agreed with but hesitated to actually carry out, a
1 CONC nd he did not actually implement Jia's proposal, which later might have prevented the Rebellion of the Seven States.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Middle reign
1 CONT
1 CONT An incident otherwise uncharacteristic of Emperor Wen occurred in 176 BC. Zhou Bo, who had been instrumental in Emperor Wen's becoming emperor and who had by that point retired to his March of Jiang (?, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), 
1 CONC was falsely accused of treason. Instead of doing initial investigations first, Emperor Wen had Zhou arrested and incarcerated. It was only with the intercession of his mother Empress Dowager Bo and his daughter Princess Changping 
1 CONC (????, Zhou's daughter-in-law) that Zhou was released, and the charges against him dismissed.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 175 BC, over the objections of Jia Yi, Emperor Wen issued an edict permitting any person to mint money (then only in the form of coins) out of copper and tin. The main beneficiaries of this policy were those with access to copp
1 CONC er, including the court official Deng Tong (??) (see also below), to whom Emperor Wen had given a major copper mine in Yandao (??, in modern Yaan, Sichuan), and Liu Pi, the Prince of Wu, whose principality had a major copper mine 
1 CONC at Yuzhang (??, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi).
1 CONT
1 CONT In 174 BC, a major incident occurred involving Liu Chang, the Prince of Huainan, who was then Emperor Wen's only surviving brother. Emperor Wen had great affection for him and did not punish him for using styles and ceremonies tha
1 CONC t only emperors were supposed to use. Also, contrary to imperial laws, Prince Chang issued edicts within his own principality and also commissioned his own prime minister. He also carried out executions and created titles for peop
1 CONC le -- two powers that were also reserved to the emperor. Emperor Wen constantly excused him for his indiscretions -- which included assassinating Shen Yiji (???), the Marquess of Piyang -- but eventually became unhappy. He asked h
1 CONC is uncle Bo Zhao (??) to write a letter to Prince Chang to try to change his ways. Instead, Prince Chang was offended and planned a rebellion. When the conspiracy was discovered, Emperor Wen stripped Prince Chang of his title and 
1 CONC exiled him to Yandao -- with the intent to teach him a lesson and then summoning him back. However, on the way, Prince Chang died -- probably by suicide. In 172 BC, Emperor Wen, missing Prince Chang dearly and still lamenting his 
1 CONC death, created his sons Liu An, Liu Bo (??), Liu Ci (??), and Liu Liang (??) marquesses, again over Jia Yi's objection.
1 CONT
1 CONT Also in 174 BC, when Xiongnu's new chanyu Laoshang came to power, Emperor Wen continued the heqin policy by giving him a prince's daughter in marriage.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 170 BC, Emperor Wen's uncle Bo Zhao, who had been instrumental in his administration, killed an imperial messenger. Emperor Wen forced him to commit suicide. This incident drew criticism from later historians, who believed that
1 CONC  he should have curbed Bo's powers in earlier and saved his life in that manner.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 169 BC, Chao Cuo (??), then a low level official, offered Emperor Wen a number of suggestions at dealing with Xiongnu. Emperor Wen was impressed, and made him a member of Crown Prince Qi's household. At Chao's suggestion, in 16
1 CONC 8 BC, Emperor Wen instituted the policy that if people contributed food for use by the northern defense force against Xiongnu, they could receive titles or have their crimes pardoned.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 167 BC, Emperor Wen banned the corporal punishments of facial tattoo and cutting off the nose or a foot, and replaced them with whipping. These punishments would not be instituted against as a matter of formal legal sentencing 
1 CONC for the rest of Chinese history. (However, as was later noted, this actually caused more deaths, and so the amount of whipping was further reduced in 156 BC by Emperor Jing.)
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Late reign
1 CONT
1 CONT Later in his reign, Emperor Wen became superstitious and started search for supernatural events. In 165 BC, at the instigation of the sorcerer Xinyuan Ping (???), he built a temple north of Wei River dedicated to five gods. He the
1 CONC n promoted Xinyuan and awarded him with much treasure. At Xinyuang's suggestion, Emperor Wen planned a thorough revision of the governmental system and the building of many temples. In 164 BC, Xinyuan Ping had an associate place a
1 CONC  jade cup outside the imperial palace with mysterious writings on them, and also predicted a regression in the path of the sun. (This phenomenon has never been adequately explained, but might have been actually a partial solar ecl
1 CONC ipse.) In response, Emperor Wen joyously proclaimed an empire-wide festival and also restarted the calendering for his reign. (Therefore, the years 163 BC and on, for the rest of his reign, was known as the later era of his reign.
1 CONC ) However, in winter 164 BC, Xinyuan was exposed to be a fraud, and he and his clan were executed. That ended Emperor Wen's period of supernatural fascination.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 158 BC, when Xiongnu made a major incursion into the Commanderies of Shang (?, modern northern Shaanxi) and Yunzhong (??, modern western Inner Mongolia, centering Hohhot), Emperor Wen made a visit to the camps of armies prepari
1 CONC ng to defend the capital Chang'an against a potential Xiongnu attack. It was on this occasion when he became impressed with Zhou Bo's son Zhou Yafu as a military commander -- compared to the other generals, who, upon the emperor's
1 CONC  arrival, dropped all things and did what they could to make the emperor feel welcome, Zhou remained on military alert and required the imperial guards to submit to proper military order before he would allow the imperial train to
1 CONC  enter. Later, he would leave instructions for Crown Prince Qi that if military emergencies arose, he should make Zhou his commander of armed forces -- instructions that were heeded during the Rebellion of the Seven States.
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wen died in summer 157 BC. He was succeeded by Crown Prince Qi. Emperor Wen, in his will, reduced the usual mourning period to three days, contrary to the previous lengthy periods of mourning in which weddings, sacrifices,
1 CONC  drinking, and the consumption of meat were disallowed, thus greatly reducing the burden on the people. He also ordered that his concubines be allowed to return home. (Before and after Emperor Wen, generally, imperial concubines w
1 CONC ithout children were required to guard the emperor's tomb for the rest of their lives.)
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Impact on history
1 CONT
1 CONT Emperor Wen was considered one of the most benevolent rulers in Chinese history. His reign was marked by thriftiness and attempts to reduce burdens on the people. His reign and that of his son Emperor Jing were often collectively 
1 CONC known together as the Rule of Wen and Jing, renowned for general stability and relaxed laws.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Bisexuality?
1 CONT
1 CONT As noted above, Emperor Wen greatly favored Deng Tong, for no particular apparent reason, and he gave Deng much honor and wealth despite Deng's apparent lack of ability. This, coupled with later references by officials trying to p
1 CONC ersuade Emperor Ai against giving his male lover Dong Xian too much authority -- during which those officials analogized Dong's position to Deng's -- has led to speculation that Emperor Wen had a homosexual relationship with Deng.
1 CONC  It is quite possible, but also hardly proven based on available evidence. It should be noted that in 162 BC, Emperor Wen permitted the prime minister Shentu Jia (???) to discipline Deng for his arrogance and threaten him with dea
1 CONC th, before pardoning Deng. In Emperor Wen's request to Shentu asking Shentu to be lenient with Deng, he called Deng his "jester." This would appear to be contrary to an indication of a romantic relationship.

1 CONT
1 CONT Empress Dowager Bo (???), known as Consort Bo (??) when her husband was alive, and more formally as either Empress Dowager Xiaowen (????) or (rarer) Empress Gao (???) (d. 155 BC) was an imperial concubine for Emperor Gao of Han (L
1 CONC iu Bang) who would, unanticipated by her, become the mother of an emperor.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Early years
1 CONT
1 CONT According to Chinese historical works except the Book of Han, Lady Bo was, when she was young, the prettiest concubine of Wei Bao (??), the Prince of Wei. Wei Bao was once allied with Gaozu of Han to defeat Xiang Yu's force, but l
1 CONC ater betrayed Liu Bang by defecting to Xiang Yu's camp. Unlike other defectors who switched side again at the Liu Bang's final victory over Xiang Yu by rejoining Liu Bang, Wei Bao remain loyal to Xiang Yu to the end. After Han Xin
1 CONC  conquered Wei, Wei Bao and his entire family were brough in front of Liu Bang waiting to be executed. It was too late for Wei Bao to regret and his begging was ignored until he noticed that Liu Bang could not take his eyes off La
1 CONC dy Bo. Utilizing this opportunity, Wei Bao managed successfully to have his life spared by Liu Bang by giving Lady Bo to Gaozu of Han as his concubines. Historical records did not provide the information on whether other members o
1 CONC f Wei Bao's family were spared as well, but it was likely the case.
1 CONT
1 CONT However, Lady Bo was not much favored, and after only one occasion of sexual relationship, Liu Bang never saw her again. However, that rare occasion of Liu Bang had sexual relations with her was enough to make her pregnant and bor
1 CONC e him Prince Liu Heng, and when Liu Bang heard the news, he made Prince Liu Heng the Prince of Dai, after he declared himself emperor. The birth of her son elevated her status from Lady Bo to Consort Bo, and unlike many other conc
1 CONC ubines, was not confined to the palace, but accompanied her son to the remote Principality of Dai (modern northern Shanxi and northwestern Hebei) to be the princess dowager. Dai was not a rich domain to begin with, and on top of t
1 CONC hat, the region was under constant threats and attacks from Xiongnu. Although Consort Bo could not live a luxuriou lifestyle as the princess dowagers (for her son would not either later when he became an emperor), she still manage
1 CONC d to have a relatively comfortable life. Nonetheless, Consort Bo had to work in the occupation she previously had, as a seamstress to help out. (According to the Book of Han, Lady Bo returned to her previous occupation as a seamst
1 CONC ress when on one occasion when Liu Bang, then the Prince of Han, saw her among the group of seamstresses, he made her one of his concubines. But all of the rest of the story depicted in the Book of Han is same as other Chinese his
1 CONC torical works). Such rather difficult living conditions in comparison to other consorts had an unexpected benefit: unlike other consorts who became Empress Lü Zhi's victims due to her jealousy, Empress Lü Zhi was very sympathetic 
1 CONC to Consort Bo and frequently sent financial helps, partially due to the fact that Lady Bo and her son posed no threat to Empress Lü Zhi's quest of power.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Rise to the top
1 CONT
1 CONT In 180 BC, after the death of her mistress, Emperor Gao's wife Grand Empress Dowager Lü, and after the officials then slaughtered the Lü clan, they offered the throne to Prince Heng over his nephew Emperor Houshao -- whom they acc
1 CONC used of not being imperial blood. Prince Heng consulted Princess Dowager Bo, who could not decide either. It was later, after they dispatched Princess Dowager Bo's brother Bo Zhao (??) to the capital Chang'an to observe the situat
1 CONC ion and to ascertain the officials' good faith that Prince Heng chose to accept the throne.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Later years
1 CONT
1 CONT After Prince Heng took the throne as Emperor Wen, Princess Dowager Bo was honored as empress dowager, even though she had not previously been an empress. She was largely unassuming as empress dowager, and did not exert anywhere cl
1 CONC ose to the influence that Empress Dowager Lü asserted over Emperor Hui or even her daughter-in-law, Empress Dou, would later assert over her grandson Emperor Jing. The one major instance in which she asserted her influence was in 
1 CONC 176 BC. At that time, Zhou Bo (??), who had been instrumental in Emperor Wen's becoming emperor and who had by that time retired to his march, was falsely accused of treason and arrested. Empress Dowager Bo, believing in Zhou's in
1 CONC nocence, famously threw her scarf at Emperor Wen, stating:
1 CONT
1 CONT     Before you became emperor, Zhou was in control of the imperial seal, and commanded the powerful northern guards. How ridiculous is it that he did not commit treason then, but now plans to use his small march as the base for a 
1 CONC rebellion?
1 CONT
1 CONT It was at least partly due to her influence that Emperor Wen eventually released Zhou.
1 CONT
1 CONT She either did not try to intercede similarly (as appears more likely) or was ineffective in her intercession, when her brother Bo Zhao killed an imperial messenger -- a crime far more serious than ordinary murder -- in 170 BC. Ev
1 CONC en though Bo Zhao was her only sibling, Emperor Wen, although not having the heart to execute him publicly, eventually pressed him into committing suicide.
1 CONT
1 CONT Empress Dowager Bo married one of her relatives' daughter to her grandson, then-Crown Prince Qi, during her son's reign. After Emperor Wen died in 157 BC and Crown Prince Qi succeeded him as Emperor Jing, Empress Dowager Bo became
1 CONC  grand empress dowager. There was no recorded instance of her trying to assert political influence after that. She died in 155 BC. (This would prove disastrous for Empress Bo, Emperor Jing's wife, as she, now without support, was 
1 CONC soon deposed.)
1 CONT
1 CONT After she died, she was enshrined in a temple of her own, not in her husband's temple, because only one empress could be enshrined in an emperor's temple, and Empress Lü was already enshrined in Emperor Gao's temple. However, late
1 CONC r, during Emperor Guangwu's reign, he effectively reversed their positions by enshrining Empress Dowager Bo as "Empress Gao" and demoting Empress Dowager Lü to a separate temple.

1 CONT [edit] Early life
1 CONT
1 CONT Liú Bang was born into a peasant family in Pei (present Pei County in Jiangsu Province). When he was young, he did not like farm work, and was evidently living a rogue's life. Not surprisingly, he was not the favorite son of his p
1 CONC easant father.
1 CONT
1 CONT After he grew up, Liú Bang served as a patrol officer in his county. Once he was responsible for transporting a group of prisoners to Mount Li in present Shaanxi province. During the trip many prisoners fled. Fearful that he would
1 CONC  be punished for the prisoners' flight, Liú Bang released the remaining prisoners and fled himself, becoming the leader of a band of brigands. On one of his raids, he met a county magistrate who became impressed with his leadershi
1 CONC p skills and gave his daughter Lü Zhi (??) to him in marriage.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Insurrection against Qín
1 CONT
1 CONT In 209 BC Chen Sheng led an uprising against Qin Dynasty and assumed the title "King of Great Chu." Pei was in old Chu territory. At the time that Liú Bang released the prisoners he was to escort to Mount Li and then became a fugi
1 CONC tive himself, Xiao He was serving as a secretary to the county magistrate of Pei County. When Chen Sheng started his rebellion, the county magistrate considered joining the rebellion, and at the advice of Xiao and Cao Can (??) (wh
1 CONC o was then a county police official), he sent Liú Bang's brother-in-law Fan Ceng (??) to invite Liú and his company of bandits back to Pei County to support the rebellion. Fan found Liú, but on their way back, the magistrate chang
1 CONC ed his mind and closed the city gates against them, and also, afraid that Xiao and Cao would open the gates themselves, wanted to execute them. They jumped off the city wall and joined Liú. Liú Bang, apparently at Xiao's suggestio
1 CONC n, then sent letters to city elders urging surrender into the city by shooting them in on arrows. The elders agreed, and they assassinated the county magistrate and opened the gates to let Liú in, offering him the title the Duke o
1 CONC f Pei.
1 CONT
1 CONT Liú Bang served first as a subordinate of Xiang Liang and then, after Xiang Liang was killed in action, became a subordinate of Mi Xin, Prince Huai of Chu, who was also the nominal leader of the coalition of the rebel states. Prin
1 CONC ce Xin named Liú Marquess of Wu'an. It was about this time that he met Zhang Liang (??), who would become a chief strategist of his.
1 CONT
1 CONT Prince Xin made a promise that whoever occupied Guanzhong first, which was the plain of Central Shaanxi, the Qín homeland, and the core of Qín Dynasty, should be awarded Guanzhong as his kingdom. He then sent Liú Bang for this mis
1 CONC sion, partly because he considered Liú a kind and merciful man, and partly because he did not like Xiang Yu, whom he considered cruel and impetuous. When Xiang Yu was busy fighting the main force of the Qin Dynasty, Liú invaded Gu
1 CONC anzhong with relative ease.
1 CONT
1 CONT In December 207 BC, the last Qín ruler Ziying surrendered to Liú Bang and his rebel army, and in 206 BC Liú entered the Qín capital Xianyang. However, as now Xiang Yu was the most powerful rebel at that time both Ziying and Xianya
1 CONC ng were instead forced to be handed to Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu even considered killing Liú in one dinner party that would be later known as the Feast at Hong Gate, but decided otherwise.
1 CONT
1 CONT [edit] Chu-Han Contention
1 CONT
1 CONT Now considering the whole former Qín Empire under his domination, Xiang Yu realigned the territories of not only the remaining parts of Qín but also the rebel states, dividing the territories into 19 principalities. Xiang Yu did n
1 CONC ot honor the promise by Xin, Prince Huai of Chu, who would soon himself be assassinated by Xiang's orders. Instead, he gave Guanzhong to the princes of three Qins. Liú Bang was only awarded the Principality of Hàn (modern Sichuan,
1 CONC  Chongqing, and southern Shaanxi).
1 CONT
1 CONT In Hanzhong, Liú Bang focused his efforts on developing agriculture methods and training an army, through which he reinforced his resource accumulation and military power. Before long, Liú broke out of his principality, deposed th
1 CONC e kings of three Qins and occupied Guanzhong, where he launched a war now known as the Chu-Han War, against Xiang Yu.
1 CONT
1 CONT Although Xiang Yu was far superior in military ability to Liú Bang, he was at a political disadvantage. Xiang Yu kept defeating Liú in the battlefield, but each of his victories drove more people to support Liú. When Xiang Yu fina
1 CONC lly was defeated, he could not recover and committed suicide.
1 CONT
1 CONT The war lasted five years (206–202 BC) and ended with Liú Bang's victory. Having defeated Xiang Yu, Liú proclaimed himself emperor and established the Hàn Dynasty in 202 BC and made Cháng'an (present city of Xi'an) his capital cit

1 CONT [edit] Succession
1 CONT
1 CONT Crown Prince Liú Ying, the eldest son of Liú Bang and Empress Lü, was the heir apparent of Liú Bang. However, Liú Bang disliked him because he considered Ying to be too weak as a ruler. His favorite son was Ruyi, Prince Yin of Zha
1 CONC o, by Lady Qi, one of his favorite concubines. Liú Bang attempted to make Ruyi crown prince but failed because most of his ministers remained loyal to Ying and his mother Empress Lü.
1 CONT
1 CONT Liú Bang's affection for Lady Qi and Ruyi inflamed Empress Lü, and after she became empress dowager after her son's accession following Liú Bang's death, she poisoned Ruyi and tortured Qi to death.

1 CONT [edit] Evaluation
1 CONT
1 CONT Historians' account described Xiang Yu as "having the kindness of women," meaning that, in his opinion, Xiang's "kindness" was petty and did not benefit either his regime or his people.
1 CONT
1 CONT Xiang Yu also did not know how to utilize his talented subordinates; Han Xin, for example, was a soldier under Xiang, and his later defection to Liú Bang, for whom he served as the commander in chief, would be extremely damaging t
1 CONC o Xiang. Other main problems with Xiang's rule was his deliberate cruelty in military campaigns, his inability to accept criticism and wise counsel, and his inability to delegate.
1 CONT
1 CONT Liú Bang, on the contrary, was bold and arrogant. These being said, he knew how to manipulate his peers and subordinates. He bid them glory and territories generously when he was fighting Xiang Yu, which won the hearty support of 
1 CONC most of his peer princes and subordinates. However, once he became the emperor, Liú Bang ruthlessly oppressed them and executed several of them, most notably Han Xin and Peng Yue. Ying Bu was driven to rebellion by fear, and was a
1 CONC lso destroyed. Liú Bang's strong suits were his ability to make decisions based on counsel of others, having an uncanny ability to figure out what counsel is wise and what counsel is not wise; his ability to delegate; and his abil
1 CONC ity to figure out what would bring a person to follow him.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT An incident involving Ying Bu demonstrates his personality well. Ying Bu was initially a subordinate of Xiang's, and in reward for Ying's military capabilities, Xiang created him the Prince of Jiujiang. However, Xiang also clearly
1 CONC  began to distrust Ying, and once when Ying, then ill, was unable to lead a force on Xiang's behalf, Xiang sent a delegation to rebuke him and to monitor his illness, not believing the illness to be genuine. In fear and goaded by 
1 CONC the diplomat Sui He (??), whom Liú Bang sent to Jiujiang to try to make an alliance with Ying, Ying rebelled against Xiang, but his army was defeated by Xiang and he fled to Liú Bang's headquarters. When Liú Bang received Ying, he
1 CONC  was half-naked and washing his feet, and he greeted Ying in crude language. Ying, a great general in his own right and a prince, was so humiliated that he considered suicide. However, once Liú Bang had Ying escorted to the headqu
1 CONC arters that he had built in ancitipation of Ying's arrival, Ying became impressed — Ying's headquarters had the same size, same furnishings, same level of personnel staffing, and same security as Liú Bang's own headquarters. Ying 
1 CONC got the impression that Liú Bang's earlier slights were in fact endearments, treating him as an equal and a brother in arms, and he became a key figure in Liú Bang's campaign against Xiang.
1 CONT
1 CONT Xiang Yu was generally remembered as a fallen hero, while many considered Liú Bang a rogue. However, Liú Bang treated the commons much better than the former nobles. He was a truly popular monarch, thus establishing one of the gol
